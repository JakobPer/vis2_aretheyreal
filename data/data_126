I turned to look and I saw five lights (4 white lights and 1 red light) in the air flying directly over the houses on my street. These five lights were in (what I am going to call) a formation that suggested they should have been attached to a passenger airplane.  The lights came from the east and flew low over the houses on my street. They were very close to me but there was no sound and I could tell that they were not coming from a commercially available drone, or any other drone-device that I know of. The space between the lights, in which I would have expected to see the body of an airplane, was empty. There was no visible structure holding these lights in their relative formation. I could see the sky and mountains behind them.  The lights flew past me from east to west and then turned in unison toward the northwest and flew over another city before disappearing into the distance. When I finally looked at my boyfriend to get his reaction, he was just staring at the spot the lights disappeared. I asked him “Did you see what I saw?” and he responded by saying, “Where was the plane?”  At that point we talked about what he both saw and agreed that we saw the same thing. We agreed that for lack of a better explanation, we had seen an invisible passenger airplane, or something pretending to be one.

Hi I have witnessed craft every night now for 3 months I know that may sound crazy but it very true I am a very sane person to tell the truth I never believed in this stuff. 3 months ago I began noticing starange lights in sky . I started climbing on the roof at night one night I woke up on the roof after falling asleep and all around me was a smoke or cloud like substance that had a weird smell and I looked and not 10 feet from my face to my left was a very very large craft it looked as if it was made from black glass very sleek . I was very shocked that it made no sound. It slowly backed up about 50 yards and very fastly was gone at first I thought it disappeared but it just zipped off well without sound. Since then I have saw other types of craft and also more of the triangles also. The craft are coming progressively closer each night about 2 weeks ago I started seeing another style of craft very close every night I’m not really sure why me why they are n! ear me but every night even when I leave my home I see the triangle ships follow me through my whole trip. I had contacted mufon when all this all began at first the ships used to stay farther out but mufon sent a investigator who was amazed and confirmed the sighting of these craft. Now these craft come substantially closer every single night for the last 3 months these ships always has some type of cloud substance around them I believe they somehow create this stuff because it help conseal  them. Something I might also add ever since contacting mufon I have also been seeing a lot of drones following me which I believe could be government drones I see a very large drone a lot very very close and this drone is a large square platform type drone with a wheel at all four corners and it has multiple cameras the difference in these drones and why I believe they are government is these things are semi loud to extremely loud and all the exterterestial craft is silent. I’m not sur! e of your procedures but I hope they are different because I w! as very disappointed in how my experience with them was very underwhelming. I decided to reach out to ufo center because yesterday I believe I was possibly abducted for the second time, I contacted mufon after the first.

It looked smooth at some points but then as it began to move slowly towards the thunderhead it stopped turning and looked jagged.  Almost like looking like a rock.  It was brown or brownish the entire time and stayed at the same altitude.  My wife observed the craft with my binoculars for a moment but she couldn’t keep a fix on it as the sun set.  It did give a slight reflection as the sun went down in front of the clouds but it disap! peared towards the east behind the trees.

We had binoculars, warm jackets, Apple Cider (non alcoholic) and fresh baked apple and pumpkin pie. While we were watching the moon rise in a southeasterly direction, we were looking at some developing vapor trails from high altitude jets flying the routes up and down the heavily traveled west coast.  While doing this we noticed a string of lights (no vapor trail) that seemed to be at a fairly low altitude and headed from north to south over the mountain range we were on.  These lights were not very bright and seemed like they were attached to a structure of some sort that was very long and narrow but not linear, the lights seemed to be adjacent to each other or within a cubist framework.  It seemed to be probably a hundred meters long and one or two wide, not knowing the exact altitude made it very difficult to judge its size.

Seen traveling then vanished! As a lifelong lover of space, weather, aviation craft etc.  from a young age I have always found myself staring up to the sky.  I mean compulsively.  Whenever I step outside, I always check the full skyline for sun, moon, stars, storms, aircraft ...anything.  Also as an Engineer I’ve always believed that advanced technologies do or have existed. Despite all this and in 40 years of living I’ve never seen anything unexplainable in the skies.  This changed on Oct 31st 2019.  I prepped the kids for Trick or Treating then went outside on our north facing deck of my home in the middle of a populated area.  Immediately I noticed a black object sitting in the sky maybe a mile or two to the north.  At the same time I heard the sound of a small prop plane, and at first I thought this propeller sound was coming from the black object and that the black  object was just a typical aircraft.  But I then noticed a small, much closer, very slow flying Cessna traveling west to east above I-94 that was clearly making the sound I heard.  It was just getting to dusk as I remember the Cessna’s flashing lights were on and I could just still see its paint color.  I refocused back on the black object and my heart started to race a bit as it looked unusual and rectangular.  Seconds later it started flying towards me, but at 45 degree angle from straight at me.  I now could clearly see it was indeed a black colored rectangle (geometric prism) or aka brick shape.  It moved with the wider dimension out to its sides (not lengthwise).  The object then moved by jumping(?) forward and started now to the ESE direction, I rubbed my eyes   as I could not believe it and also it seemed it could blur out of focus.  Overall, I got some very clear looks at this object and it was an definitely an engineered flying craft unlike anything I’ve ever seen! There were two larger white circles at each end and about 4 smaller white circles all in-line with the larger two circles across the width of the rectangle.  There were no flashing lights and these larger circles weren’t lights it appeared, but looked maybe half spheres recessed into the craft like ceiling can lights or something...I don’t know.  They were white, but very soft and hazy, not bright at all.  The object was really messing with my mind and senses.  It had: zero sound, moved supernaturally smooth (it appeared it could also sort of jump forward in space, unlike typically high speed acceleration) , extremely poor aerodynamics (like a wide brick like geometry),  came in and out of focus (optical cloaking?),  and not sure if I was panicking but I felt like it saw me watching it. Finally, it flew fast well out in front of the Cessna in the sky and as soon as I reached for my phone it completely disappeared!  This all lasted I think about 15 seconds.  I’ve been obsessed since then and have read extensively through the NUFORC archives of rectangular craft.  I also have performed google image searches and have found some very similar pictures and descriptions.  Ive created a detailed drawing using MSPowerpoint  It was certainly larger than the Cessna, and was pretty dang big, but not humongous- maybe 180ft width or “wingspan” if you will.  Also, due to its direction change from the N to ESE I also saw its depth and height (side profile) very well and it was much smaller maybe 20ft depth x15 ft high,  hard to say for sure.   So, clearly, dimensionally it strangely was just a 3D rectangle - no protruding tail, wings or features other than the circles on the bottom.  I strongly believe the Cessna could’ve easily seen this object as it was maybe just several hundred feet higher in elevation and zoomed out ahead of the Cessna or just to the pilot’s front-left.

One day I seen a shooting star when I was about near the Hope Mills area, before the St. Pauls exit.  This was in the southeast sky, to my left as I was driving south.  It was unusual this time because it suddenly changed direction, as if it had bounced off of a solid object in the atmosphere.

It was all pretty fast, about 5 seconds, and faded like shooting stars do eventually. I was driving and was not able to record anything.

This object, viewing it at a length size, had to of been comparable to the size of a football field or bigger.  I live under the flight path to Sky Harbor airport where the planes travel in the west direction to land. As the object was flying over the valley, it was silent. It had a very eerie feeling to it for the 60-90 seconds I got to experience. It was a grey/black object with 3 lights spread out equal length on the craft.  The lights were red, and the rear light was flashing red.  This object, like I said, was silent.  No lights on the object like a plane, no engine sounds, complete silence and darkness other than the 3 lights on the craft.  It slowly traveled over the Mesa area in the northeast direction and I lost eyesight of this object. This was not a plane. This was not a jet.  This was not a blimp.  This was not any craft known to man, I know this for a fact.  I am a very reliable source that has been studying this subject for years now and it is not my first experience.

It sort of resembled a spaceship that you would see in intergalactic movies such as Star Wars or Star Trek. This object could not have been a plane, as there were no red or green lights representing the left and right wings. This aircraft had only white lights, located on the front as mentioned in addition to small ones located on the bottom of the aircraft.

Our 1960 Mint Green F100 Ford pickup truck with overhead camper was backed up to roughly 20 feet from the concrete-canal, set-up with camp chairs, lantern, snacks and fishing gear set out, and already catching catfish with 2 hooks on each line….although there was very little Moonlight, the area was very bright due to the huge security floodlight-beam attached to the roof of the small Hydro Electric station (10’x10’ building about 20’ away) shinning to the opposite side of the canal where the other side of the shore was visible, I’m guessing to be 50 feet off in the distance?  ((name deleted)), (the dog) was napping near me, sitting in the camp-chair 5’ from the waters-edge tending my fishing-pole ...all of a sudden ((dog's name deleted)) bolted to all four feet and started the strangest sound I ever heard from any dog then or to this day!...guttural-howl/growl-scream, as if the dog might be in severe pain, attempted to crawl under my camp-chair where obviously he cannot fit, then trying to cover his ears with his paws as if trying to block some ear piercing whatever?...after that, he was scraping his head on both side of his ears along the sharp-gravel in obvious horrific pain when we heard/noticed the water in the canal was lapping the shores vigorously and rippling in concentric circles from the center of the canal, so thought maybe a Moose or some very large animal jumped into the water but we would have heard-it if that happened?  .soon we realize we can see the opposite side of the canal clearly and no Moose or animal in sight...including we see that the concentric circles are full round circles so whatever it was the circles started in the middle of the canal not at the levy edge and the ripples/waves are getting stronger, similar to what a helicopter hovering overhead would cause?...except, it is completely silent and no dust or gravel blowing around, all-the-while the dog is continuing to suffer, at that moment we both look-up to see a huge pulsing-glow-fire-orange/red oval (football) shaped craft above-us with no apparent windows, seamless-looking solid material/construction and no visible means of propulsion or con-trails? (guessing 50 yards in length by 10 yards in height) approximately hovering at the height of a 20 story building...nearly over the top of us we see that it appeared to be spinningiin-place at a supersonic rate (how can this not make noise is going thru my mind?)...we freeze in our tracks, our heads trying to justify/comprehend what we are seeing while the dog seems to be acting worse for pain and screaming even more?...we grabbed our gear and shot for the truck 5 feet away as we see the object bolt across the sky away from us in a blink becoming a barely visible-dot only a moment later to reappear above us again in the next blink of time!...how is this possible with no sound we humans can hear but maybe the dog can hear-it?...about 3-5 minutes have gone by now... Strangely, our dog ((dog's name deleted)) jumped in the camper-back with the gear as soon as the door was barely open, forcing his way inside using his head as a plow in a panic-fleeing-demeanor...I say strangely, as he never wants to ride in the back of the camper, only wanted to sit in the truck cab with us, so I figured he must be as afraid as we are?!?  Fleeing, as we are freaked-out and shaking in the fright-flight-mode (full-on heart-pounding fear) with dust and gravel spewing from the truck-tires as we swerve out of there as-fast-as-possible and are soon out of eyesight of the craft due to the dense forest of Pines, Oaks, Buckeyes, Sequoias and Redwoods blocking the view. It took another several minutes before the dog recovered from his painful event and finally stopped panting...as we drove along in silence trying in our minds to make sense of what just happened?...my ex-husband blurts out in a scary-threatening-tone, and commanded that “I better not repeat this to anybody as he would deny it and call me crazy”...and actually ‘with my dog as my witness’, he was more compelling evidence/witness of something strange in our midst than the opinion of my ex-husband. Approximately a month later, while reading a book from my co-workers: Book Club in Medford, Oregon, titled: Chariots of the Gods by Erich von Daniken, and I assumed it would be similar to the Kon Tikki story?...quickly I realize it is a book of UFO sightings and read a page where there was a similar experience of water rippling in concentric circles with no sound or apparent rotary blades in site?...I felt a huge shock-knock of a flash-back to our sighting like it just had-happened and thought it could really be true what we witnessed that strangest of nights could possibly be from another world?!?...hmm?

My friend and I left out of New York City on New Years Eve.  It was approximately 1:30 AM, New Years Day. Traffic was light at this time on this particular stretch of interstate. and there were no other cars in our proximity.  We were in a mountainous area, but I'm not sure what town we were near. I was the passenger and my friend was driving.  As we rounded a large turn, we both observed 4 lights at the top of a mountain, situated in an arc which swept upward from left to right from the top of the ridge and up into the sky.  The lights were stationary and resembled a constellation, yet these white lights shone brighter than usual stars and were evenly spaced apart at perhaps 100' intervals.  As we approached NW on the Interstate, they would have been to the lefthand side of us. Before either of us could remark to one another about what we were seeing, the lights began to snake down the side of the mountain toward us in a serpentine motion, one after the other.  The lights were very bright, and lit up the trees near them as they moved down the slope. We thought it may have been a group of 4 snowmobiles racing one another.  However, the fact is that when we first saw them, they were stationary in the sky.  The lights also never stopped appearing to shine directly at us as they moved, unlike the lights on the front of a snowmobile or ATV which would have pointed in different directions as the vehicle traversed a trail.  This was also a remote area, at approximately 1:30 AM on New Years Day, so a group of snowmobiles racing at top speed down a steep mountain was not a very likely scenario.  This was the rational explanation which came to both of us after the sighting.  However, we agreed that what we saw were absolutely not conventional vehicles in any way. We were both quite stunned and perplexed by what we were witnessing, and by the time I said we should pull over, we rounded a bend and lost sight of the formation of lights.  I remember that during my last glimpse before losing sight of them, the lights were still moving in that organized, serpentine motion and were close to the bottom of the mountainside. It is one of my greatest regrets that I didn't have the wherewithal to demand my friend pull over and stop the car while they were in view.

Later that day on a drive to DeKalb my  grandmother remarks to my grandfather that the star in the field looks like the thing that was over the house.  I look out and see that strange looking star again and ask where they saw it.  Their stated location is the upper purple arrow.  We observe it at approximately the same time. 2.  Sometime later my grandmother tells me that there is this light flying in the field behind the house.  It is night time and upon arrival I can see what looks like this approximately 10 ft ball of light flying back and forth in the field.  She thought it was a remote control helicopter or plane.  We go to the edge of the field and realize, we can't hear anything.  It is approximately 100 or so feet from us. It's a silent ball of light. Brown arrows pointing left and right show direction. 3.  At home one night I go to grab an apple, realize my hands are dirty, set the apple down, and go to wash them.  As I'm washing I hear a crunching noise and look back at the apple, which now has a bite in it.  I look down at my hands and they are wrinkly as if they have been under water for quite some time.  Edges of apple are slightly brown. Mouth that made the bite is smaller and wider than anyone in the house.  Ufo activity not yet suspected. 4.  I'm in my backyard at night and see the light again, except this time it's above the trees. It looks like some viscous liquid light is sloshing from side to side and drops from it, down into the forest below and then it begins to spin like Sonic the hedgehog.  Today we would say it looks a little like ferrofluid. The spinning ball of light proceeds to fly a certain distance through the trees and disappears. The red Dot and line show it's approximate position and direction (left to right). I get my grandmother but by this time I'm just pointing at what looks like a star. 5.  It is now dead of winter 2007, approximately 8-10pm. The sequence of the last few months has had me wondering what is going on. I'm standing at my back porch sliding door and wonder aloud, ""Are you out there?"".  Out in the woods where the ball previously travelled through the woods, starting from the right most position, a ball rise and becomes brighter as it rises maybe 10 feet.  Hard to say since it was so far away.  It drops down getting dimmer till it is completely dark and then rises again, getting brighter as it rises.  When it gets to the top of the oscillation, it moves left to the halfway point, in a very smooth straight path at about a ft a second. As it's dropping from it's high position I turn my head down and close my eyes to make sure something is misfiring in my eyes.  It has reach the topped off the second oscillation and is now moving left to it's left most position and drops down, getting darker till I can't see it anymore. What happened next is about what you would expect.  I called people screaming that there was a giant ball of light in our backyard and someone needed to come with me to see what it was. I wasn't going by myself.  They responded pretty much how you would expect. After some research I found a description on the glow of light for high resistance capacitors giving off a whitish golden glow, matching the description of what I saw. 6. After a couple months, things have appeared to calm down.  I'm looking out the back po rch window and get the courage to go out into the woods.  It is late afternoon. As I'm walking through the cornfields (black arrow in #6), I see a man walking parallel to me (yellow line in #6).  He is starting at the floor, walking directly parallel to me.  My first thought is that he looks like my cousin, except shorter. He never looks up.  Never acknowledges I'm there.  Creeped out, but too curious to turn back, I proceed forward.  He walks all the way into the woods, parallel to me. Once in the woods, I realize this was all a hallucination.  The trees are too thick for anything to fly in there, let alone hover.  Coming to turns with this I keep walking and see a path. Walking down the path and dealing with the very real possibility that I may have to go see a doctor I come across a path that intersects the one I'm on.  It's the path from illustration 4. I look back and im level my porch.  In front of me is a river, and across from that an empty field.  I'm standing where it was.",2019-06-07T00:00:00,42.1086,-88.686

I know living near and working for the State of Nevada that a lot of military things go on around here but this was way different. I was in my hot tub outside with a lady friend, as a witness, on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada mountain range looking directly East towards Yerington, Nevada.  The event lasted long enough for both of us to watch it for about 15-20 seconds. There was a triangle shaped object in the sky that was brightly lit up with the point of the object moving to the north as it was coming from the south.  The whole object was lit up to define it’s shape and was behind a faint cloud (less dense) where the shape of the light could easily be seen flashing thru the cloud.  It made about 12 very quick motions up and down at 90 degree angles in the sky and was flashing light as it made the changes in direction.  The shape was easy to follow as it passed thru the faint cloud.  As it passed out beyond the cloud, it just turned into a bright ball of light, brighter than the surrounding stars so you could still track it for a few more seconds as it continued to travel north.  Crazy light show for sure. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting, indicated by witness, was flawed.  We have attempted to contact the party, but unsuccessfully.  We have amended the date above.

My friend Mr. T (names kept anonymous for protection) was a witness as parts of the constellation showed themselves and then disappeared, especially the star Rigel, which moved and shifted color across the spectrum while being seen by both he and I. Using a $900 pair of night vision goggles I have seen a set of two very hot very columns coming off two lower sides of the craft  When I describe them as “showing themselves” I mean that on a very bright night in the middle of a city while overcast with scattered altocumulus clouds, these objects appeared to me with the brightness of a shooting star while not moving except for abnormal jaunts to nearby static positions. While moving, they changed in brightness by magnitudes that could not be accounted for by the clouds moving.  With Rigel in clear appearance when I showed tom, the entirety of the constellation became the brightest thing in the entire sky along with the one other star under orion.  Same location at 12:23 pm I placed a call to vanderburgh dispatch and told them about the appearance, they recommended to me a call center for ufocenter.com at 206 722 3000  At 12:25 I placed the call and the director Mr. Davenport took my call. He suggested documenting my experience in writing and asked if I have a camera I have a Sony A7R3. it’s a world class mirrorless camera with in body stabilization. Without much time to waste I went back outside at the end of our call with the camera and a fixed focal length (prime) lens at 28 millimeters. I picked this lens because prime lenses are incredibly sharp and it was already on the camera. I fixed the focus on these objects after setting the aperture wide open and started taking a number of pictures at a high ISO (around 6400?) and aperture. Noticing they were noisy even though the camera was on a tripod, I checked the exposure time and automatic settings had pushed the exposure time to 1/6th of a second. I set the iso first to 100 and began taking a number of long exposure photographs (10, 8 seconds). I noticed in one image a “star trail” on one of the objects. It was straight, not an arc, and ! the end of the trail was very bright as though the craft or object had moved and then become stationary. I have done astrophotography with lenses like this one in the past and star trails aren’t distinguishable near this altitude without a 15 second exposure. I set the iso higher to 640 and started taking a number of photographs across the sky at about a second long exposure. As a part of this report I will upload them.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,37.98475253093363,-87.51397041619798

It was a mostly clear day a little after 1pm I believe.  I noticed what looked like a cloud formation moving toward me from downtown Portland area.  This storm front caught my attention because it didn’t look like any I had ever seen before.  It was perfectly rounded with no stray clouds.  There was a bright orange cloud at the center.  The formation took up my entire westerly view.    As I watched it approach my home I noticed it was moving faster then a normal cloud system.

There were no other lights only one solid disc of yellow white light.I even caught a picture of this light disc but somehow got erased from my mini disc in my phone.

It was as big as a truck maybe slightly bigger.  It was next to the bridges support beam.  It shot out a white light that was a beam of light the light didn't spread like a spotlight would that's why I say beam.  The white beam went into the Hudson River.  Never seen anything before this or after.  It was literally a flying saucer like something you would expect to see in science fiction.

Once the object/light was directly in front of me it stood still and then very fast went straight out towards the ocean.  It was incredibly fast and I was very confused at what I saw.  A few minutes later the exact same thing happened again.  This time I took a picture of the object while it was travelling away from me.  The only thing I could tell was that it was a light - I could not see any kind of body with the light.  Also, I don't think there was any noise with it but I can't remember.

It was a fine day and  I took some pictures of the landscape below with my Canon camera. Then I closed the camera and put it in my handbag. After a while, I looked out of the plane porthole again and I saw something like a yellowish plastic bag floating in the air at some distance below.  While watching, the shape started to change quickly.  A sort of brown nucleus was just forming at its top.  Then the shape developed a tail like a comet and started to move in the opposite direction of the flight (see my drawing). It was then that I thought of taking a photo of it.  But as the camera was inside the handbag in its case, a few seconds passed until I could press the starting button.  All I could get was the jet trail (underlined in picture 1). At that time, the plane was flying somewhere above Slovakia or Austria.  The approximate spot could be estimated by means of the photos taken before and after the moment (photos 2 and 3). When I downloaded the photo on my PC, I could notice a cluster of lights in the upper right corner. They showed up in other pictures as well (e.g. photo 4).",2019-06-07T00:00:00,,

Two of us were former law enforcement trained observers. My brother in Thomas Township southwest of our location was first to notice the objects while on the phone shouted what is that?  There is something coming your way but could not describe it. Shortly after 2 of us clearly spoted these 2 Triangle designed craft that were enormous in size flying from the south west to a north east direction.  The objects were metaltic, they emitted no light what so ever. They made no sound at all.  It struck me as the objects were very far out of our atmosphere but yet so large they were clearly visible as if flying right overhead. We observed first one of the craft followed by a second craft both turned into a northern location once they had crossed the plane of our house.  The craft moved at amaz! ing speed faster then any modern military aircraft I have witnessed such as F16 or F15 fighter jets.  I will never forget this observation as long as I live.  I am still in amazement what each of us observed.  We do not believe in UFO or Alien Spacecraft yet we know what we saw, was not man made.  It was impossible to be any kind of optical illusion or fanstom sighting.  All I can visualize is these two gigantic space crafts again seemingly high in space yet so large they seemed to be flying just overhead as low cloud height.  Very difficult to describe to anyone as to reference to size and distance.  Following the incident we were  all amazed but what could we do about it call 911?  What will they do about it?  Nothing.

I’m working at a house we own to fix it for sale. My friend tells me to look at a roofing shingle that was caught on a cable wire that ran from a pole to the upstairs unit. As im looking at the shingle I saw what I first thought were brids, sea gulls, circling up high.But they were uo too high and they didn’t have wings. They werent heading in a direction. They were circling around in a small area, going in and out and around in no pattern. That’s why I thought they were sea gulls. They were white and I couldn’t make out if they were disks or round. But they were circular. I didn’t take my eyes off them, not even for a second because I was slowly beginning to think they were extraterrestrial craft.  My friend I was with saw the fleet of UFOs over our town one day standing on his balcony. Plus, I saw my first UFO go right over our house in 2014 july 2.  I was called to go look at a house that needed painting by my employer/ friend . I didn’t want to g! o cause it was Sunday. On the way down the hill , right below where our house is, I saw what I first thought was a paper bag that blew up from the parking lot of a grocery store down below about 60 yards away. I stopped and looked, never taking my eyes off it. I began to sense something not right, because the plastic  bags are white and this thing was a brass color and seemed to be floating along with the wind, which is why I thought it was a  bag. It floated over a tree on our property and I noticed the sun reflect off it. That’s when I knew it was metallic. It was a disk with a convex area on the bottom. No seams or lights and it was low enough that   I could almost hit it with a rock. Since then im always on the lookout for UFOs. Getting back to the 7 UFOs , they were right below the clouds circling around and I never took my eyes off them. They moved around for about 90 seconds and then faded away, maybe moving up into the clouds. They were gone. I yelled for my friend to look but he wasn’t interested in seeing some birds, so he didn’t bother. I knew then they were UFOs and told him about what I saw. I kept looking and explaining how they acted. Its not every day you get to see craft from another star system. After about 3 minutes of talking a jet fighter came along and went throught the exact area where the objects were. I didn’t bother calling the air force base near us because I know they will deny everything.",2019-12-19T00:00:00,,

They were moving from right to  left. I thought how strange to see them over here because I just moved to Florida and I haven’t seen any seagulls or pelicans near or around where I live. Then things got hyper intense.  These were not birds but translucent lights lit very dimly that were embedded underneath in a black boomerang shaped craft. It flew almost directly overhead. Its speed was very swift and it was completely silent. I was amazed but at the same time inexplicable frightened; the silence of the craft scared me the most. I estimate the altitude of the ship to have been 1500 ft. It was flying much lower than traditional flying aircraft.  As the craft was flying overhead, I thought I noticed concentric circles within the round lights of the ship. Only 2 rings in total and it wasn’t in the all the lights, only the 1st-2nd lights closest to me from my vantage point. The craft had smooth edges all around and I did not notice any seams except the 2 concentric rings on a couple of the lights embedded underneath. It looked to be made of one solid very black metal. I thought “my God, no wonder they can fly around un-seen because of their sheer quietness, speed and stealth.” The only real way to observe this craft would be looking straight up. It blended that well into the night sky.  As the craft moved away, a longing inside for ""them"" came to me. I tried to use telepathy to call them back…to make a U-turn. I had so many questions but not enough answers. The craft kept rapidly moving away and I felt sadness. I don’t know if it disappeared over the horizon, de-materialized or turned on it’s invisibility cloak. It seemed to completely fade out as it got further away from me. I estimate the whole sighting lasted 5-7 seconds which seemed like an eternity to me.  I then ran back to my apartment to get my wife. And I mean I ran. When I got inside, I told me wife what I just witnessed and we decided to go back to the lake. She bundled up because last night it was very cold; by Florida standards. We stood in my exact spot for approximately 5 minutes before she decided to go back in. Just too cold for her and I was very anxious to share my story. For reasons I don’t quite understand, this ship I observed has really frightened me. Even this morning while making this drawing and writing this email, I still feel scared.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,,

I am not one to assume anything strange upon first seeing something out of place. I generally assume there is a logical explanation for almost everything that can be observed with the naked eye.  Tonight however, I witnessed something unusual and inexplicable. I was fishing at a local pond facing northward when I saw 3 lights obviously at high altitude.  Living near airports growing up gives you a unique frame of reference.  They were either three objects moving at very high speed in formation, or a single massive object. I could see most of the stars and constellations over me, to the east and to the west, however, their were hazy clouds in the distance where I was facing and after 2-3 minutes it began to become obscured by those clouds. I have witnessed this many times and would have thought little of it except without a drastic change in the objects heading there was a major clearing not far to the east of where It disappeared.  I watched hoping to get another look thinking I might ascertain what it was, but it never reappeared. That is the point at which I reached the conclusion that this was not something normal, nor could it be explained by logic or common sense.  The lights were steady, with an equal distance between them however as far away as it was that distance appeared as if it could have easily covered a football field between the each light. There were no flashing lights, there were also no sounds which was also very strange.  I have witnessed hundreds of passenger jets fly overhead and their are distinct characteristics.  I saw both but the solid lights moving rapidly until the vanished and there was never a sound.",2019-06-07T00:00:00,40.1037323943662,-85.67924319248827

The image looks alien and is a face that is not human looking.  The image has a mouth that looks human.  The eyes do not.  I have tried to find out how this image showed up.  I used a phone to record this video from my laptop and was in my home.  Again the video I was recording was a video I had taken outside of the birds and was in my yard.  I had uploaded it to my laptop.  This video was taken from a different phone so I wanted to record it on my phone.  I have tested what I did when recording and I am unable to reproduce this image.  I tried to copy and paste the image here but was unable to. I have had other people view this ! video and many believe it is alien form.  Some say it could be a spirit.  I can email this image to be viewed.  Thank you.,2019-06-07T00:00:00,42.1741,-91.9882

I am a male nearing retirement age.  I have lived decades in Raleigh, but I grew up in Cary, NC.  I attended NC State University – receiving bachelor’s degrees in Business Management, Economics, and Computer Science.  I write software for retailers as a profession.  Tonight, Saturday, November 30, 2019, I witnessed what seemed to be a UFO over Cary, NC. At about 6:45 pm, it was raining as I was leaving my in-laws home.  I headed North East on Kildaire Farm Road, and I was approaching the intersection of Cary Parkway.  Traffic was modest and slightly slower than usual.  As I approached the traffic light, it turned red, and I began to brake.  Because I looked at the traffic light, I noticed what appeared to be a commercial jet above and beyond the traffic light.  I nitially, I simply thought it was an airplane, and I forced myself to concentrate on the intersection and traffic light until I stopped for the traffic light. I then realized that what I saw did not make sense because commercial airlines do not fly that low over cities, and nothing that large could fly that slowly.  It looked like the underside of a jet wing.  However, it was huge, but it was initially difficult to judge the height – even though it appeared to be moving very slowly.  The slow speed resembled a blimp over a football game. I speculated that at that speed, it must be something like a blimp that was covering the NC State vs UNC football game at Carter Finley stadium.  However, it looked nothing like one, and it did not seem possible that a drone could be flying at night when it was raining that hard. The sky appeared to be a very faint light gray color – not black yet, and tree lines were not visible. With only a few exceptions (like the traffic light), the night was like a black and white TV show – no reds, greens, blues, or yellows. This was the heaviest part of the rainstorm and because of the rain, my windows were “rolled” up. I could see maybe ten lights on the underside of a “wing(?)” One or more may have been blinking, but if so, not with the usual intensity of an airplane light. My focus was on lights that were not blinking. They seemed to have the intensity of a 60-watt incandescent outdoor house light when viewed from the street. The lights retained their distance from each other and moved synchronously. I studied them carefully for hints that this was projected from a source on the ground – such as light on raindrops or objects at different heights like buildings, trees, etc., but there was no “overspray” of light. There was a faint glow around the lights – making them appear to illuminate a modest amount of the underside of the “wing” that the lights were mounted on. Without a visual frame a reference for something like this, it was challenging to estimate the height, but it appeared to be hundreds of feet high – not thousands. Obviously, it was higher than the trees, but not by a lot. I never saw anything that resembled an airplane body. It was either obscured from view or there was not one. It may have been shaped like a chevron/B-2 bomber (but a much lighter color). The object appeared as if it may have been heading in my direction (i.e. away from the airport), and it was in the process of making a slow, left turn (i.e. to my right).  I had to move my head down, towards the steering wheel, because my roof was blocking my vision, and I saw the plane at roughly forty-five degrees up and in front and slightly to the right of me – like it was over the Wendy’s restaurant ahead on the right. It then occurred to me that I could only hear traffic and rain noises – nothing like the sound of an airplane. Only this one object appeared. I could not say how the object disappeared. It seemed to disappear behind something like a tree. It never seemed to change course. There were no visible contrails. This was visible for perhaps ten seconds. Then, someone in a SUV like mine came up fast on my left (in the left turn lane) and stopped quickly. I could see two people inside, and they were moving around inside – flailing their arms. I assumed they wanted me to lower my window, so I did. The vehicle contained a lady driver with dark hair – perhaps in her mid-thirties and what may have been a five to ten-year-old girl(?) in the passenger seat. The lady excitedly asked, “did you see that?” I had been deep in thought – trying to understand what I had seen, and because she came from behind me, my first thought was “seen what?”. Then I realized that she had seen this, too. So, I answered, “yes”. She replied, “what was it?”, but I had no answer. I did not want to say that it was a “flying saucer” – because of how improbable that was, and to nitpick, it did not appear to be round. I then noticed that the traffic light had turned green and that another car was behind me. I wondered if they had seen it, too. Then, I thought “the lady beside me already knows it is unidentified (as in UFO) – that’s why she is asking” and “you had better answer quickly before people behind us get upset”. The car immediately behind me came around me on the right (turn lane), but I did not know who else was approaching me from behind. I did not want to scare the little girl in the SUV, but finally, I blurted out “a spaceship?” because I could not think of anything more accurate/likely. While the window was open, I attempted to smell the air for jet fuel, but I could only smell rain. I had my cell phone during the observation, and I considered getting it out to take a photo/movie, but I was wearing blue jeans, and I knew that I could not remove it quickly. Also, it was still raining, and I was somewhat dumbfounded about what I had seen. Then, the object disappeared. I glanced back up, but I could no longer find the “airplane”, so I proceeded through the intersection, and I believe the lady made a left turn. I stopped at a nearby restaurant near the Maynard Road intersection, and then I called my wife. I wrote this description as soon as I arrived home. I am reporting this information as accurately, precise, and truthful as possible.",2019-12-19T00:00:00,35.78376197916666,-78.80133489583334

At approx 2120 Pacific on 11.10.2019 viewed from Cocolalla, ID. Weather cold, sky clear, no precipitation: While sitting on my couch watching TV with my family I saw a large, white circle of light (through my west facing window beneath the TV) flying in a westerly direction at a speed comparable to a meteor. The light was WNW of my home. It was approx double the size of the ISS, and several orders of magnitude brighter than the brightest I've ever seen the ISS. It did not trail any streak of fire, it did not break apart, and it made no noise that I could hear from indoors. I immediately ran out of the house onto our west facing porch to attempt to view it further, and did not see or hear anything else unusual. I informed my wife about what I saw, but she had not seen the light through the window.  I went back to watching TV with my family. At 2148 (based on cell phone video time stamp) I observed two amber or possibly orange colored lights had appeared in the sky visible through the same westward facing window. The lights appeared to be well passed Huckleberry Ridge. Viewed from my home, they were just north of Vega. They appeared to be a similar diameter as Vega, but perhaps not as bright and definitely were not white. The lights at first appeared stationary but then I could tell they were drifting upward as they passed a faint, small star in the background. I yelled to my wife to come quick, and asked my daughter to bring my cell phone.  My wife witnessed the two amber colored lights move toward each other and then apart from each other a couple times, before one zoomed off to the north or possibly northeast. As it zipped away its light dissipated. The other stayed in the same area, before its light dissipated too. I did not personally see the dynamic movement of th! e two amber lights because I was busy unsuccessfully attempting to capture the event on video. I did observe the remaining amber light fade away.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,48.1062,-116.6764

Hi, it was around midnight in late August/September 1966 that this undisputed sighting was observed. For credibility purposes, I am an apprentice trained aircraft airframes engineer, later to study physics at degree level. At that time I was not a ‘UFO’ buff, in fact, I had hardly heard of it/them. I should also point out that I had recently made a similar report to MUFON from whom I was contacted by a UK UFO ‘field investigator’. This investigator, who initially was inclined to remind me of ‘black projects’, possibly suggesting that this was part of such a project that I had seen. I instantly rubbished this theory, as you may understand after reading my full report. Apart from this, he had little/nothing to contribute. I was not impressed. As I was saying, I was in bed with my eyes closed unable to sleep, which was unusual after a days work. My wife was in bed with me. With eyes closed, I was alerted  by a strong light in the room, which upon opening my eyes a strong silver/white light filled the room. The bed was backed up against the window, with curtains drawn (closed). The only other way light could enter the room was through the front bedroom window, passing through the doors of both rooms, if, in fact, both doors were open. I do not remember if they were open…. Upon seeing this light I drew back the curtains to see nothing in the immediate vicinity causing the light, but looking to my left , SE direction, I saw what appeared to be a small ‘craft’ approaching in my general direction. My first thought was “who or what are they looking for, as a searchlight was directed towards the rooftops at about 10 degrees angle. Then, noticing this ‘craft’ had no wings, or apparant means of arial support, my next instant thought was “who are THEY?”  The front elevation of the craft was very similar to a helicopter cockpit, with roughly a rectangular cross sectional shape.  The similarity with a helicopter ended as there was no rotor blades, anywhere!  Nothing appeared to be upholding this craft to be airborne.  As it drew nearer, at very slow ‘walking pace, it drew level with my first floor window, just behind next doors rear extension.  I could just see the complete airframe.  It had two equally spaced very small internally lit windows along the side.  As it cleared the extension it made  an immediate right hand turn towards my garden, in the length of its own axis.  In this view the moon shone clearly on the side facing me.  It was a very clear, windless and moonlit night with only about 25% cloud, making for very good clear observation.  With moonlight on the side facing me I saw what appeared to be two ‘doors’, possibly hanger doors, I recall.  One conclusion should be made is that with a searchlight and two windows, internally lit, the craft was occupied.  A striking note was that the ability to slowly fly at just above, maybe 10 ft approx. above rooftops was really amazingly accurate and stable.  No sound at all was made, and as it was level I was looking out my open window, and there was nothing to be heard. Not even a rush of air.  As it crossed the rear gardens it seemed to be only around 40-60 ft high and about 50-60 ft away from me.  I clearly located its position and height by opposite houses as a fixing point, as I was about 55 yards fro a junction, in a quiet residential road.  The houses opposite were therefore around a similar distance away, with the craft slightly nearer to me than the opposite houses.  Height and located were easily collated fairly accurately.  As the craft drew level with my rear extension it made a similar, but left hand turn, continuing in its original route.  This was odd, cause no good purpose was seen for this course  slight adjustment, then continuing on its original course – no sense at all.  As I then could view the rear elevation there appeared to be a large pale orange disc attached, covering the whole cross section.  I had to assume this to be the power source.  The craft then continued over the opposite rooftops, again, only just clearing them, disappearing as the distance increased.  I was really concerned about it’s height!!!  It must be stressed that this craft showed no signs of any hostlity and could quite possible observe me leaning out of the window.  I was too intrigued and amazed to be ‘scared’.  I should have  mentioned that when I asked my wife to “take a look at this” she was simply too scared, and dived under the covers.  We both knew they was no source of light in the area, of that nature, or any other.  Amazingly I slept really well, to wake up switching on the radio, to hear reports of ‘several’ other ‘objects’ seen along the seafront, about a mile away from me.  They were said by witnesses to be hovering over the water, changing colours and diving under the water after making two loud bangs.  My opinion was the ‘loud bangs’ were sonic booms as the objects accelerated wary too fast for the eye to see.  These other ‘objects’ were reported to have been seen for 160 miles along the south coast fro Dover to Southsea (Portsmouth)  No mention was made of my sighting.  The sightings were given full local media coverage, with no explanation given at all.  The final kicks paper admitted the objects were totally if unknown origin, and referred to as UFOs.  I did, and go not use the term UFO cause my sighting was that of a definitive solid craft, that was of unknown origin then, and now.  There was no technology that superior then and there is none to this day.  This craft, in conclusion, could not have possibly come from this world.  If it had, we would no longer being using chemical based propulsion systems.  That’s a fact!  My obvious conclusion, and firm belief, is that other civilisations are, and have been, visiting this world, possibly for thousands of years, or more.  Why haven’t they officially contacted us?  If we were highly advanced beings seeing what a state this works is in, would you or I wish to integrate with us?  For what purpose?  I am not wishing to copy certain sci- fi series, but, perhaps, quite rationally, they have  strict ‘non-interference, decrees!!!  That makes good sense, so they are never going to land on the White House Lawn, are they!?  A theory about the alleged inter- breeding – maybe they are trying to improve the human race  Now that would be something really worthwhile!!",,,

Always I have been drawn to observe airplanes in the sky.  This particularly bright and sunny July or Aug. day, my. eye was drawn to, I thought, a commercial jet reflecting the sun.  An unusual glowing made its shape unknown. As I was driving and at a long red light, I was expecting it to level out then I could see its shape. It was very much a golden glowing circular shape.  The traffic light finally turned green.  Still, it was the same.  Soft edged glow. The color and duration of the glow caused me to pull over. It was northbound on a common Seattle to Anchorage route.   About ten degrees higher in the sky than I would guess a common jet is at.  A guesstimate of this object at 45 degrees high. I watched it go northbound at  a level altitude, glowing the entire way, until it was out of sight.  Easily four times as fast as a passenger jet. That evening on our local teen radio station, AM 1410 CFUN, they announced receiving reports of a UFO,in the western sky. I only submit this report to bolster the author, Leslie Keene, in her book, “Of Generals, Pilots and UFO's.”   In reading it my jaw dropped as she described this very same observation to me:  Large golden glowing objects observed.... The main difference being the time frame as it was 1975 about when I observed and she writes of them in the 1980's.  I now realize it was a phenomenal daylight sighting due to its large size, speed and color.  Of course only once and never again have I seen anything unusual.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,,

During the summer I was allowed to play outside until 10PM, so I went outside after changing clothes. There was a large forest surrounding my home, but the area between our house and the neighbors home was about 100 yards, with 50 yards of trees.  There was a huge silver/white birch between our homes that spread out and dominated that treeline. I was walking the path between our homes when it became eerily quiet.  The cicadas stopped their noises. Completely.  Night animals were oddly quiet as well.  As someone who was a youthful but experienced hunter, and spent a great deal of time in the woods, I knew this generally indicated the presence of a predator.  Being that I was aware the most dangerous thing in our evening woods were (1) people or (2) wild dogs, I wasn't overly concerned since I knew that stretch of woods like the back of my hand and would notice ANY misplaced shadow or item in the vicinity. Out of an abundance of caution however, I decided to look around.  Especially since I had a mild sense of being watched (not unusual given the number of animals in the forests around my home).  It was the hairs standing up on the back of my neck that pushed me into paying closer attention though.  Not seeing anything ground-worthy around me, I looked up into the trees.  A bobcat maybe? I wasn't sure.  Looking up though, it was the lights that caught my attention. What appeared to be about 50 yards above the birch tree I mentioned, was a series of three bluish/white lights arranged in a triangle formation.  The area between them blocked out all starlight above them. I don't remember if it was a cloudy evening or not, but the area between the lights was definitely darker than the night sky around it.  I couldn't make out any other details, other than the lights and the dark triangle formed by them. I don't recall any other interaction with the object I saw, but I remember feeling a breeze that smelled odd then ""snapping out of it"" when I heard my father call me back to the house from our garage.  Which was odd because he said I'd been outside about 30 minutes already and I was needed inside to help my sister with some chore they needed doing; it was odd to me because it seemed like only about 5 minutes to me.  I looked back up, and the sky had returned to normal with no trace of the lights. That's it. Nothing since.  Just thought I'd pass this along.  My parents didn't believe I'd seen anything and chalked it up to an over-active imagination, but the image is burned into mind and I can still see it to this day as if it was just happening.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,35.907,-77.5424

Two other witnesses were involved.  By the time authorities arrived, the craft had taken flight.  It left behind significant damage to a tree which still bears visible scars today. The event began shortly after my twin brother and I went to bed.  He called out to me from his room when he noticed a bright yellow object bobbing around at the end of our valley.  We watched for several minutes with interest, and recognised that this object was certainly not behaving like conventional aircraft.  Shortly a second object appeared which emitted a red light. It approached the yellow object.  Both had a slightly larger apparent size and brightness of Venus.  The red object zoomed up to the yellow object, stopped and reversed, and then did it again as if to prompt a reaction.  And it got one! The Yellow object took off with the red object in close pursuit.  They zoomed around, zigzagging across the sky with extreme speed and acceleration, like a couple of blow fly’s on steroids.  The craft involved seemed to be at odds with each other.  The running craft occasionally became “stuck” in mid- flight as if caught by some invisible force.  It shook back and forth until it freed itself, and then the chase continued.  The craft performed impossible manoeuvres with instant zigzag turns and accelerations.  The entire event lasted for approximately 10 to 15 minutes until eventually one disappeared behind the hill where it crashed. The Crash was reported by Daryl Browne, 7th or 8th of Feb 1980 (Now deceased).  He described hearing a load crunch.  He went outside to see what had happened. When he went around to the back of the house where the noise had come from, he could hear a tree creaking and groaning.  ,Upon pointing his torch into its upper branches, he saw a yellow craft measuring around 8 meters in length.  He described it as a speedboat shape. It was wedged between the broken branches, and causing the tree to groan under its weight.  A branch measuring around 30cm in diameter had been knocked from the tree.  Daryl called the authorities, but the craft managed to take flight before they arrived, leaving no wreckage, only damage to the tree as evidence.  You can Google his version of events for more detail.  One website containing his story is called Project 1947 by Loren E. Gross – page 20  I later spoke with Daryl’s family, confirming that he lived at the location where we saw the craft disappear I also examined the tree and the damage.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,,

We could hear the sound of the sea and seagulls as expected when on the beach. Then suddenly, my brother pointed up at the sky as he’d spotted some strange lights above us in the sky, at which point we all looked up, and then we were all suddenly aware that all sounds around us had stopped and all went completely silent, it was a bit like being in a soundproofed room.

Lakeside Beach area Webster Ma Our unexplained experience happened in 1981 Christmas Eve 12/24 between 12:30 AM-1:00 AM . My ex – husband, myself and my children were driving home from a family Christmas Party. It was very late and it was very dark because the road we were on was Lakeside Ave Webster Mass , and at that time didn’t have many light poles. As we came up to the Lakeside Beach I saw to my left just above the trees some type of thing that looked like a huge sled. It was only about 20 -25 feet up.  It had 2 running blades that had different colors blinking. I remember blues and reds, it was so quiet and the air was so crisp and clear that night. All I remember hearing is the crunching of the snow under the tires.  I don’t know why but I don’t remember being scared.  The object was probably there for a couple of minutes, I’m not sure because we hurried home, went to bed and never spoke about it.  I didn’t speak about it because at that time I didn’t remember it.  I just found out r! ecently that my  ex-husband recalled everything that night.  When I started recalling what had happened was around 1999. My husband now, myself and kids went up to North Conway, NH, I believe around 2006 for an annual vacation that year.  We were all talking about scary things and I decided to tell them what I had experienced, now remember, I hadn’t talked about it because I had only just remembered it a few years back.  As I told them about the sled one of my son’s stopped me from continuing and said, “Yes, you told Dad to get back in the car”.  I looked at him and said you saw it?  He said “Oh yes” my son only remembers a very bright white light. He said that his Dad said, “Oh, we better hurry and get home because it looks like Santa is coming”.  I don’t recall any of that conversation.  I asked my son how long he remembered it and he said he thinks he’s always remembered but he too never talked about it until I brought it up.  None of my other kids remember anything from that night. So to make matters weirder my ex-husband did not see a sled type of craft on the left side of the road.  His recollection is it was directly in front of us just behind some house where there was a marsh area.  He explained it was enormous oval shape with many colored lights and a large white light coming from it.  He said he always remembered seeing it but doesn’t know why we didn’t talk more about it.  He does not recall any conversations, but said all of the children were awake. I still ask myself why I didn’t remember something so incredible.  Over the years my son has seen a couple of unexplained objects in the sky. I have never seen anything again although I have had 2 unexplained instances.  The first was I woke up one morning and had a long scratch on my thigh, which has left a scar.  Then another time I woke up with a bad burn on my arm which also left a scar.  I felt no pain until I woke up. I don’t understand why now I need to tell this story, but I do.  It’s been bothering me for so many years.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,42.0501,-71.8801

Jan 31st of 1981 my wife and I with my two daughters went to Broken Bow, Okla.  To visit friends and family of our church that we belonged to before we moved to Hooks, Texas, for my Job.  We attended a watch night service and left there at about 12:30 AM Jan 1, 1982, and visited with one of our close church friends until about 2 AM.  We left Broken Bow on New Years Morning (That 2 AM I mentioned) and headed for Hooks ,Texas. We went south on route 259 south towards the Red River Okla/Texas Border, but decided to go by way of DeQueen , Ark . As we were coming into Foreman, Ark.  Off to the south of Foreman, we noticed a very odd thing.  Something was lighting up the sky a reddish orange color so bright it looked almost like a huge forest fire.  Only thing it was pulsating at a regular intervals. After turning south on AR41 going south we could still see this pulsating orangish red light out in the distance.  We traveled on AR41 for about 5 miles when upon hitting a small rise going back down into a shallow valley we saw what at first we thought was an ambulance sitting still on the road not moving an inch.  As we drew nearer, I noticed it looked squarish in shape and had an unusual light display about it that really didn't look like an ambulance that I've ever seen before.  AS we got even closer it began to start moving down the road about 15 miles per hour in a 55 mph zoned road, which was only a two lane road with a non passing divided lines.  I couldn't understand why they were going so slow and my wife kept warning me not to pass it . WE followed this thing until we crested the last little hill just before crossing the Red River (Boarder).  Just as we crested it, the vehicle ahead of us made a swishing sound and appeared to dart straight up in the air.  WE were going down the hill towards the river and near the Arkansas side two highway patrol/or sheriff vehicles were parked as they would do if watching for speeders in either direction.  They had their red flashing lights on while sitting there. As we passed them, my two daughter confirmed what my wife and I saw . It appeared as though they were somehow not moving.  They didn't even move or look at us as we passed them at about 3 AM in the morning and only vehicle on the road that time of morning.  We arrived home in Hooks I believe before 3:30 AM  we went to bed and woke up about 9 AM that Morning wanting to see the New Years day happenings on TV.  What we heard was from a local TV station that there had been a UFO sighting near the Red River early that morning and near the river power lines and trees were covered with what some refer to as Angels Hair.  I Told my wife that I had to go see this so we made the trek to the river to see .  The Angels Hair was there and covered quite a bit of things and traffic was somewhat heavy even though the news ask people not to go.  I had my suspicions though and I wanted to check out if what I thought happened did.  That is thinking I saw the vehicle go straight up in the air. We crossed the river and I ask my wife to look on her side of the road while I looked on my side to see if maybe there was some kind of side road going off it before the river.  No such turn offs that we could tell off before or even near the top of the rise before dropping off towards the river. I've looked for any kind of a report on this and could not find anything on line . Except on guy on here on the same date made a report of seeing a reddish/orange light that he says he saw but his I believe he said his sister saw nothing what he did.  Was just wondering if it might have been possibly the same vehicle or thing he saw.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,,

I was 17 years of age, between my junior and senior years of high school.  I was employed on a local farm where I had a late night job duty at 9pm.  I had noticed red lights that appeared to be radio tower lights while I was working but didn’t think much of them until, on the way home, driving south on a gravel township road, I spotted three distinct red lights approximately ½ to ¾ miles away to the south. It was then that I realized there were no towers in that area, so I stopped my car and got out to get a better look.  Each of the three lights consisted of three closely spaced red lights blinking on and off around the objects circumference.  As I stood there trying to figure out what they might be, I realized that there was no noise whatsoever.  No rotor noise.  No engine noise.  No crickets or natural noises, and I was within 200 yards of a creek and timber in August. The closest object was approximately 600 yards away.  The middle object was approximately 300 yards beyond the first, both of which were directly over the creek.  The third object was about 400 yards south of the middle object and slightly ahead of the other two (to the east).  All three objects were moving very slowly from right to left (west to east). I became very anxious at that point, got in my car, and raced for home approximately two miles away.  At one point, midway home, I looked back and could still see the southernmost (third) object, but not the other two. My dad saw me as I walked through the house and said I was, “as white as a sheet” and asked me what had happened.  I was hesitant to say, but when I told him, he grabbed his keys and asked me to show him.  We went to the area and whatever it was, was gone. The next evening, my dad called me to meet him and our county Sheriff where I gave a report and drew a sketch of what I had seen.  His wife had seen a similar object while enroute back to the jail after transporting a prisoner to the neighboring county, except that what she saw was stationary over a feedlot with a bright light shining down onto a small group of cattle.  He said the object shut off its light and disappeared, but that his wife had also noted that the object made no noise, and she was within 200 yards of it.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,38.9577,-97.4086

Now rest assured, I am prior service military, and being a former boy scout - one thing I would not do with something like this, lie or fib!  I am only telling the experience as I remember it.  This is NO HOAX, but to those idiots that want to deem it as one, go right ahead - I can only tell you what I had seen, heard, witnessed, experienced, nothing more. The date is approximate, but the time is about right.  I was an 11 year old boy scout about to get his first merit badge - astronomy (how ironic).  I was known as the astronomy whiz kid, and ""teacher's pet"" for the class that about 15-20 of us were doing.  The age ranges of the other scouts - ages 10-16.  At any rate, the day of our evening test, I was asked by the scout master for that merit badge to give everyone a brief practice that night before he came out to meet us to administer our test of the night skies. At about 21:45, we all mustered up on the little hill in the field that overlooked the lake and the forest, the rest of the field, etc.  I was testing the other scouts with various constellations and citing little facts, etc.  One kid tapped me on the shoulder and said ""Um, what is that!?""  I responded ""Oh that is Corona Boreal-"". I didn't finish my sentence.  That night, was the most awesome thing I think anyone could have seen - this huge triangular object. I would say it was roughly about 100-250 feet in size (could have easily been close to the size of a football field).  It made a whirring humming noise that most couldn't hear, but for some reason, I heard the harmonics of this black beauty.  At each of the vertices was a point of white light, but a red one in the middle.  The craft had to be I'd say about 75-100 feet up in the air over the forest; my conservation merit badge, which was next, taught me that the trees that we had there were roughly about 45-50 feet tall.  The craft crossed over the lake, then over the forest. Once it crossed over the shoreline, the craft began to send a red glowing ball/orb from the red light part of it.  It would go at about a 45º angle.  As the orb would descend, the craft would move forward to receive it.  It was almost like it was optic sonar, at best.  It did this between 3-5 times.  Then it slowly lifted up and the next thing you know, without warning, completely silent, and at an angle no craft on this planet (save for the possible craft we built similar) could ever do!  It would be about 5-10 minutes after this - two waves of jets (about 4 in formation) would fly overhead, and about 3-4 attack helicopters flew overhead with about 2-4 Pave Lows. The very next day, I was with my conservation group of scouts, and we had just finished a very rainy morning hike - it was extremely miserable.  There were probably about 3-4 other scouts from previous night that were with me that had seen this craft.  Off in the distance, I saw what I thought two men I had recognized as a little boy from the Air Force (another report I will need to file - hopefully not as long), along with my scoutmaster, the scoutmaster for astronomy, and a few others meeting together.  There were a couple of state troopers, local police from Rome, and kid you not - two men in black suits.  MIB?  Not sure.  Wouldn't be surprised, but being an 11  year old and not knowing about all that, you just see what you see, right?  The scoutmasters received a severe ass chewing.  Later that day, we all had a meeting, and were told we had seen a very advanced fighter, and that the pilot somehow got lost.  We were also told we were never to speak of this again to anyon! e - especially among ourselves. As I have said, this was the account of that night, and I have had a couple of other experiences throughout.  You can use to your discretion what you believe or not believe.  However, most that know me will tell you I am probably one of the most brutally honest people in this world - and to question my honesty is a death sentence in itself.  I will say there is not a day that doesn't go by when I don't think of this fateful night. And what of the forest, you ask?  I don't know - we were not allowed to go into that part of the woods the rest of the time there.  But something had spooked the people that were working in there.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,43.3748,-75.469

It was that strong sense you get when someone is looking at you that drew me to look up, I think.

Though its light(s) were very dim at first, my eyes locked on it immediately.  It was way too high up to be a plane (and a few did cross underneath as I stared).  It blinked at me slowly, as if acknowledging that it was seeing me (or watching the area).  The light strobed from soft white to yellow to blue and red, in random order.  It was stationary, hovering, but it would jerk to its left or right in a millisecond, then up or down, but for the most part, remained in its general spot high up in the clouds. Then I started noticing other lights just like it in the clouds, in the periphery.  Together the lights formed a gigantic circle, outlining some kind of enormous craft half-hidden behind the clouds, and just…surveying.  I sat out there for a good 45 minutes and it continued to blink and slightly jolt and return to its position.  And it was clear there were many others with him…or it.  It was eerie but absolutely mesmerizing.  I did take pics and videos with my iPhone but they aren't great.",2019-06-07T00:00:00,45.53464439359267,-122.93119107551487

As jet gets close, both UAP and jet suddenly disappear. My friends and I were returning home, traveling north on Rte 54 (Patriot Freeway).  At about 3:01 pm I noticed a fighter jet taking off from Biggs Airfield at Fort Bliss, El Paso, TX.  As I watched it ascend, it began to turn East away from me as it climbed rapidly.  I thought its flight path unusual, and continued to watch it ascend towards a bank of clouds above it.  The jet turned so sharply that its wings were vertical to the ground as it made a U-turn back towards the South.  Then I noticed an object hovering just below the clouds over Biggs Army Airfield.  I recognized it as a UAP or UFO, and grabbed my cell phone camera.  It took me a few seconds to get the camera operating.  By that time the jet was rapidly closing the gap with the UAP.  In response, the UAP began to back up and move away from the approaching jet.  I was stunned!  I aimed my camera and pushed the shutter button, but my cell phone camera did not respond fast enough.  Suddenly both the UAP and jet both disappeared.  The photograph time is 3:03 pm, taken just after the jet and UAP disappeared.  I asked my friend, who was driving, and he said he didn't see it.  He is an audio witness to my sighting.  I have no idea what happened to that jet. The picture shows the scene with the distant Hueco Tanks Mountains and sacred Cero Alto Mountain (tallest) in the background to the East.  The picture recorded the date and time of the photograph, and even GPS location of our car at 3,000 Gateway North Boulevard (access road to the Patriot Freeway).  Visibility was excellent at 10 miles.  I overlaid the photo with an image of what type of UAP/UFO I saw and the type of jet, as best as I could make out from four miles away (map distance).  I added dots to mark the path of the jet as it made a high-angle U-turn towards the UAP/UFO. I posted this picture and account on my Facebook profile, and had a number of responses.  Ted Roe of NARCAP made an interesting comment:  T. R. (NARCAP)  My guess.... plane was too close when the ufo bolted, inside the envelope when it jumped.

I was placed on detail to collect parachutes during my units jump. The jump was going to take place around 01:30hrs.  I was in the middle of the drop zone laying on my back watching the stars on a clear night.  As I was looking up, a UFO at tree top level move slow overtop of me.  It look like a formation of helicopter. I was thinking it’s less then 30 minutes before the drop this is dangerous.  I then notice I can not  see between the formation of lights that formed a triangle.  I also noticed it made no sound and no rotor wash.  I then realized it was a UFO.  It continued to move slow until it looked like a star among the other stars on the horizon.  I could not take my eyes off it until a second UFO crosses over me just to my left side along the same path as the first one.  I watched it move slow until it looked like a star among the other stars on the horizon.  I then watched one blink then the other UFO would blink and they blink back and forth for about ten minutes.  They were still blinking when the drop started.  I lost track of them during the drop.  That morning when we were collecting the Parachutes I asked who had seen the strange objects/UFO’s.  One of the NCO’s told me he had seen them and told me not to say anything about it.  When I got back to the barracks, I was relieved to find that ! the UFO event was reported on the local news.

With the blinds drawn it appeared in the bedroom window that a bright blue light circular in shape was being cast onto the window but illuminated the entire inside of the mobile home.  So it had a point of origin but appeared to be equally brilliant in the room...if that makes sense.  At the time, I was a Police Officer at Ft. Sam Houston, I had no idea why this woke me, there was no noise and my ex-wife did not wake up, I immediately got up and secured my pistol as my first thought was pranksters or somebody trying to do ill to me or my family. as soon as I secured my weapon I began to attempt to look through the blinds to see where the light was coming from and as I did this POOF...the light was gone.  I checked the other windows before heading outside, armed, to investigate.  When I went out on the rear deck, I heard and saw nothing.  No animal noises, like dogs barking, etc. that would indicate anything was wrong.  Very still and quiet.  I chalked it up to craziness and went back to bed.

I saw something very bright above the highway, as I got closer it resolved into a cube hovering over the road, roughly house-sized, maybe 40-50 foot on each edge, and the cube itself seemed to be composed of chrome spheres.   I pulled over onto the shoulder and got out to look at it, because I had never seen anything like it, even though it was raining.  It was hovering by my best estimate 60-70 feet above the highway, so I could see it very clearly.   After I had watched it for a few moments, it was struck by lightning, in an upper corner, and started to smoke and spark, as it slowly slipped sideways (to the north) and started to lose altitude, then appeared to crash into the pine orchard north of the highway.  As it was storming and I had a newborn in the car, I didn't go into the orchard after it to see, but I have wondered to this day what I would find if I ever went looking in that orchard (which is fenced and private property and I probably wouldn't be allowed anyway.)

At the time, I was living on Rose Hill, essentially a ridge that divides the towns of Redmond and Kirkland. We lived in a heavily wooded area, with a long gravel driveway running uphill to 132nd Avenue N.E. At one point, I thought it would be interesting to go out into this storm. The wind was blowing crazily, howling, with leaves and all sorts of minor debris flying through the air.  I didn't feel that it was particularly dangerous, though the winds were probably somewhere around 40mph.  And it was pretty cool!  So I went back in and fetched my wife because I wanted her to experience how wild this was becoming. We stood about halfway up our gravel drive, which was about 100 feet long. As we stood there, we noticed what looked like sparking in a cedar tree across the street, in a neighbor's yard. We assumed it was a downed power line that was thrashing around, tangled in the limbs of the tree. There was a transformer on a pole about 20 feet away from the sparking so there was cause for concern. My wife left to call 911 and report it. We even laughed a little because authorities were doubtless overwhelmed with calls like that and so we didn't expect much of a rapid response. Within less than a minute of my wife going back into the house, the sparking in the tree got bigger and wilder. Then there was a huge electrical sound, like standing close to a big substation. Just this powerful electrical hum that you felt in your gut. The sparking became a ball of white light about the size of a beach ball. It just grew in a few seconds from sparkings to this vivid ball of blue white light which then sent arms of electricity waving around it, like an octopus freaking out. Then there was an escalation in the humming sound until it became very deep and bassy. At that point, the ball exploded. The sound was huge, like sticks of dynamite. I threw up a hand across my eyes and I swear the light was so intense I could momentarily see through my skin. When I took my hand away, the ball was gone and the entire area had gone dark. All the power was out, and not just for blocks but for what looked like at least a mile square around. Totally dark. I expected people to come running out of their houses at hearing such a huge explosion but there was nobody. I was the only one outside, which seemed weird to me. I thought to myself: wow, I think I just saw ball lightning, which nobody I knew had ever seen except my Grandmother. I felt kind of blessed to have witnessed such a rare phenomenon. Having read some accounts of ball lightning I knew it could be unstable and blow up with devastating force. My Grandmother's stories of the two times she saw it both involved them blowing up and in one case blew off the top half of a 20 foot tall tree. So I'm standing there in the dark driveway, kind of pleased with myself, with leaves and various debris flying around me. I looked up and to my left, about 100 feet away and about the same in the air, there was this dark shape moving. I thought at first it was a limb of a Douglas Fir since there was a grove of them close by. But a tree limb should have fallen, not continued to float in the air, moving slowly from left to right, south to north. At that point, the dark shape sort of resolved itself into this object. Or maybe I was just able to focus on it. It was about the size of a dump truck, with a round part in front and an ever narrowing part culminating in a blunt point that descended in a smooth arc from the rounded front. It looked like a comma, in a sentence, but turned upside down. It was a dark gray, smooth, seamless thing. I was trying to make sense of it. My thought was that it was a helicopter but I could not wrap my mind around why a helicopter would be out in such heavy winds and flying so close to the trees.  Nor could I understand why I couldn't see any rotors or why there wasn't any sound. I'm sure my mouth was agape.  I can still remember feeling so confused about what I was seeing. Because we so close to many suburbs and even Seattle in the distance, I assumed there was some ambient light that defined this thing but when I think back on it any light would have been coming from behind it not in front so I'm not sure how I was able to see it so well. It didn't seem like it glowed because it was a flat, matte-l! ike dark gray. Directly opposite the driveway where I was standing, the object stopped and swung around so the round part was facing me. I stood there staring, still trying to wrap my mind around what I was seeing. Just then, these oval ""portholes"" lit up in a circular arrangement around the front part of the object, in a line around its middle. Each porthole was a different color and they were intense jewel tones of red, blue, green and maybe yellow around the right hand side. At that point something went off in my brain and I thought, ""holy &%$@, I think I'm seeing a UFO!""  It hung there, silent, floating, unaffected by the wind, with these vivid colors coming out of these oval portholes. I watched it dumbfounded. It seemed machine-like, like something made, not some natural object, and it had very clear and definable outlines, now made more visible because of the lights. Aside from the lights, it didn't do anything. It just hung there in the air. Later, I thought it might have been regarding me. As a matter of fact, it probably swung around because it had become aware of me standing there in the stormy driveway. Or, maybe it was just a coincidence--how would you know? Then, after maybe about a minute and a half or so, just like that, the lights went off and the round part went back to being seamless as near as I could tell. The object swung around and began to continue in its original direction, moving round part first toward the north, floating like a balloon. I started to chase it, running down 132nd Avenue N.E., dodging junk flying all over the place from the storm winds. The object didn't seem affected by the wind at all. It moved serenely on its way, purposefully, it seemed, smoothly and with no sound. As I ran up the street trying to keep it in view, it picked up speed until it was going maybe 35-40 mph. As a man in my 50s then, there was no way I could sustain running for blocks so I gave up and watched it until it sailed out of sight. From start to finish the whole encounter lasted maybe two minutes. Later I found out that there had been no downed power line to cause sparking in the cedar tree and the transformer that I had assumed had exploded was just fine. I swear there was an explosion that should have brought people running into the streets but nobody besides myself heard a thing. I've since moved from the area in which I witnessed this thing. I don't talk about it much anymore. Even old friends think you're crazy if you talk about things like this, and of course I have no proof. I never believed in UFOs because it didn't seem they could be coming from this solar system and the distances between the stars are so extreme. Over the years, I've had a whole series of medical issues and I can't help wondering if this thing had something to do with that, since I was in fine health before. Maybe it's just that I got old in the years following this encounter. But doctors have never been able to find a satisfactory explanation for some of my issues. All my life I've had strange things happen and have seen odd lights moving around in the sky.  My Grandmother was the same way.  But I've never had anything happen like this. This...was unforgettable, even though some times trying to remember it is so bizarre that it almost seems like some strange dream.  I feel I witnessed the impossible and that definitely changes your reality.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,47.69328259259259,-122.19664407407407

I witnessed a UFO sighting with 8-10 other people that was unlike any sighting I've ever heard of.  It was less than a decade ago (exact year not remembered but anywhere from 2010-2014).  None of us thought anyone would believe us so we never said anything.  Now, I feel like I should share my experience especially considering I've yet to hear of a similar one. Every year we used to vacation to Six Flags Darien Lake in Darien Center, NY.  It's a six flags with a large amount of trailer and cabin campsites that you can rent to experience both camping and the theme park simultaneously. One night, we were all hanging out around the lake.  It was late and everybody was at their campsites or sleeping.  At some point I looked at the sky.  Something breached the clouds and into view and before I could even process what it was, I heard my friend yell ""Holy S*** look in the sky, aliens are real, aliens are real!""  By now everybody else had turned up and I had been able to process what I was looking at.  An enormous diamond-like shaped airship (at least the size of a football field) was hovering and gliding perfectly and in ABSOLUTE silence directly above us. It was beautiful, with extravagant detail beyond imagination.  There were hundreds, if not thousands, of windows lit in almost skyscraper-like fashion.  On the bottom, there were round neon-blue lights; the exact pattern not in my memory.  This was not your typical flying saucer, floating lights, UFO etc.;  We had a perfectly clear and vivid view of what appeared to be a passenger/residential ship large enough to hold an extraordinary amount of people/beings. After maybe 10-20 seconds of hovering, which felt like an eternity thanks to the adrenaline and excitement, the ship slowly pointed upward.  There was a deep and low volume, but very audible, ""whoosh"".  I felt the ""whoosh"" in my chest similarly to how you can feel the bass at a loud concert.  At the moment the ""whoosh"" noise was made the ship was gone into space at literally the blink of an eye. All 8-10 of us were beyond ecstatic as we undoubtedly believed to have one of life's greatest mysteries answered.  To this day not one of us believes that we (earth inhabitants) are alone in this universe.  We do not believe that any world power on earth could possess the technology we witnessed.  Now I guess we can only wait and see if the thousands of new questions we have now will be answered over time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Back in the summer of 2012 school I witnessed something I could not explain along with 4 other people.  One of these people was my good friend and eventually my roommate who I will call H.  Everyone involved was completely sober and not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol.  Everyone saw the same thing and reacted similarly.  We were close to the craft at the time of the sighting and were able to get a good look at it.  Despite the unusual details of the sighting and the confusion and excitement that immediately followed the incident was forgotten by the next morning. 	One morning as I was waking up from a deep sleep I remembered the craft that I had seen and the memory of the night came back to me all at once. I could not understand why I had forgotten it so easily and no one had ever talked about it considering how unusual it is to see a UFO, especially from how close we were.  I immediately called H and asked if the incident had happened or not and his answer was ""oh yeah, I haven't thought about that since it happened!""  	 My theory is that this object sensed our presence and purposefully deleted or obscured our collective memory of the event.  Had I not remembered the encounter in a half asleep state I likely would never have remembered this event.  After doing some research into other ufo sightings I have found that memory loss of this kind is not uncommon after witnessing a UFO.  I also found that UFO sightings have been common in my area since 1968 because of our close proximity to a nuclear power plant. 	Many details from the night are blurry but the details I can remember H remembered as well.  We could not remember who else was with us but we agreed that there were 2 others with us. Both of us agreed that the memory loss of the event was strange and that what we saw was technology far more advanced than anything we had ever known. We also agreed that it was possible that this craft may have temporarily erased our memory of the event to potentially discredit our story when it was remembered or that we were never supposed to remember the event at all. This is a report of what we both saw that evening. 	On that night we all were trying to go from one house to another to hang out with another friend.  I had driven my car to another friends house in the same neighborhood as H's house and walked over to his house from there.  We eventually decided to walk back to the other friends house to meet up with him. The path to take to the other friends house was a short cut that involved crossing through people's back yards and using the neighborhoods greenway trail system. 	The Torrance Creek Greenway is a system of paved trails that runs through a neighborhood in Huntersville.  Several streets have access points to the greenway and there are miles and miles of paved trails on it.  We were crossing the entire distance of the neighborhood and needed to use a good stretch of the greenway to do it. About halfway through the trail we were walking we witnessed the incident.  The location was on a long straight stretch of trail that came to a ""T"" intersection.  We were on the vertical part of the ""T"" and were about 100-150 feet away from the intersection.  On either side of us was a thick mess of 10 foot trees and shrubs that was not passable by humans. At the T intersection there were much taller trees, still with thick greenery that could not be passed by people. 	As we were walking and conversation we saw it, almost all of us saw it at the same time as all of us stopped our conversation immediately as I saw it. At the end of the trail, right in the middle of the T intersection was a hovering blue orb of light that seemed to be slightly larger than a basketball in size and perfectly spherical in shape.  It was about 4 feet off the ground and was perfectly still and made no noise what so ever. It was emitting a bright blue  light and was easily visible. The solid blue light it produced was both unnatural looking and able to illuminate the surrounding area. 	There was nothing holding it up, there was no string or signs of it being suspended from another object.  The light it produced did not seem to come from inside of it and did not look like a light inside a blue ball.  Instead it seemed as the entire thing was made of a bright glowing substance or a ball of blue light.  The Voyager 2 picture of  Uranus is a good example of what the ball looked like, solid blue and completely featureless. It did not look like anything I had ever seen before. It could not have been a lamp or light held by a person because the area around it was illuminated and any people would have been easily visible. 	For 10 seconds all of us were completely silent, staring in shock at this mysterious blue orb. I had a strange peaceful sensation all over my body and felt frozen in place and very confused. It felt like the orb knew we were there just as we knew of its presence. We stared at frozen for what seemed like 10 seconds before I felt the sensation pass and someone said "" what.. what is that?""  Then we all immediately started running towards it at the same time without saying another word to each other. 	There was no thought behind it really.  I remember just feeling compelled to run towards this object, and my friends must have felt the same. We were able to run about 50 feet before the orb darted down the left hand trail.  It followed a perfectly ""ruler"" straight trajectory to the left of where it was and did not show any signs of acceleration. It immediately started going as fast as it moved, which I would estimate to be around 300-400  miles per hour.  Nothing I have ever seen moves like this thing moved. 	As we continued to run towards the end of the trail the orb darted back in the other direction, on the right side of the T intersection. It was still moving at the same high rate of speed and showed no signs of acceleration, it came back into sight precisely where it had disappeared and flew in a perfectly straight line horizontally before disappearing from view on the other side of the trees. 	When we got to the intersection the orb had completely disappeared, there was no one there but us.  It had taken us perhaps 3-4 seconds to reach the intersection after it has disappeared from sight and yet there was no trace of anything or anyone. 	For a brief period of time after the event we were all rather excited about the sighting, as none of us had ever seen a UFO.  We discussed what it could have been and almost all of us came to the conclusion that it was alien technology. We went to bed that night and then forgot the entire thing by the next morning.  Not a single thought of this crossed my mind until 2015 when I woke up one morning.  H did not remember the night until I asked him about it.

I put up one link when I noticed an unusually bright light in the sky NW 20 degrees that I assumed must be the sun reflecting on an aircraft coming in.  After 10 minutes of not moving, it grabbed my attention.  It was about 2 or 3X as bright as Venus but in the NW.  I was disrupted enough to pull my oldest boy off the Xbox and my wife to see the disturbance.   My son was unimpressed, and my wife didn’t care for anything potentially out of the norm.  I went back in and I grabbed my binoculars to see it better but it only made the light slightly bigger and shakier.

The wife went to bed and the boys back to their Xbox's as I watched both of these stationary reflective objects as they dimmed away and turned from bright white to red then dark red.  Later, as the bats and stars came out at 9:15pm, they faded to nothing. I returned to the backyard the next day earlier this time and to observe the skies to find nothing.  Skies were as usual. Analysis:  I observed these two objects from 8pm to 9:20pm in Brandon, SD on 05/14/19.  The first object was noticeable at about 8pm and about as bright as 2X Venus NW 40 Degrees.  At circa 8:15 the second object came into view and was about 3X as bright as Venus and NW70 Degrees and higher of the horizon.  The moon was about half and rising at about 135 Degrees.  I called my Dad in northern ND and he could see the moon but not the reflective objects. The objects didn’t move that I could tell and didn’t blink.  They were bright and faded red as the sun set.  I have lived in this house for 8 years and this was certainly a new experience.  I have the planets app on my phone and during this time there were no planets in the area.  I consider myself above average for astronomical activity and can usually point out planets and constellations. Right now, I don’t know what this was.  After searching the internet, I have only three guesses. 1.	  This was some sort of government stationary (90 Min+) Satellite in the north.  Although, a quick internet search says that those are above the equator. 2.	  It was maybe Jesus and Joseph Smith both just checking on us?  Hard to say. 3.	  It could also just be a glitch.

This morning me and my wife we're standing on our back deck having a cigarette and a coffee where we look up in the morning Sky to watch the satellites go by. This morning was a little different I looked up towards the Northeast sky and saw what I assumed was the satellite, so I quickly pointed it out to my wife she then quickly pointed out there was two simular shaped objects flying directly behind  the first one then about a half a second directly behind those two was one more for a total of four in a small cluster moving from the southwest to the Northeast. So at this point while I'm fixated on the cluster of four moving in the North easterly sky she had turned around and look to the Southwest then she started saying quick look there's more there's more so I instantly turned around and look up to the Southwest then we both proceeded to see seven more all following the same flight path as the cluster of four. The cluster of four was in the lead of the seven other crafts,  the cluster of 4 were in the lead by roughly 30 seconds 40 seconds , all of them were travelling at a high rate of speed they definitely definitely definitely were not aircraft In our atmosphere they were definitely outside Earth's atmosphere they were orange in colour well more like a very light white bright kind of doll looking Orange it's hard to describe the colour however we seen 11 of these anomalies all said and told all 11 crafts we're travelling from the Southwest to the Northeast between the hours of 7:04 a.m. and roughly 7:08 to 7:09 a.m. on December 3rd 2019 over the City of Red Deer Alberta.  We never heard a sound we never felt anything these crafts as they went over Red Deer did not leave a trail of any kind of light they just moved over the city fast and they we're not in Earth's atmosphere they were way too high. As a couple we like to sit out on her deck at night and in the mornings and just stare up at our beautiful sky we watch the satellites go by we watch meteor showers shooting stars Etc we've done this for quite a while together something we enjoy something we like to do but this morning kind of shook us both up just a little we talked about it and it has to be the most weirdest things and the most unexplained things we've ever seen in the sky. We together decided you go on a forum and write down what we saw we feel that the universe is not empty of life we believe there has to be something out there other than us. And to think we are the only ones out there in our universe and every other universe would be a huge travesty of human common sense.

The coordinates of their backyard where I was standing are 35.7XX,-94.85XXXX.  It was a perfectly clear night and i had turned out all the house lights for a better view of the stars.  As I sat in a lawn chair looking up, I saw what I took at first to be a plane moving from west to east before me across the sky.  It was traveling at a speed  that would be expected for a small aircraft.  I could see it very clearly, as it was just above the treetops.  The object was about the size of a small aircraft. It was oblong in shape and silver in color.  It had a flashing red light, but oddly did not make any sound, which really caught my attention.. As I watched, it began to slowly meander and loop around as if searching for something, while descending towards  the ground.  Then I noticed it had changed direction and was traveling back towards the west again.  It continued to descend at ground level moving west behind the tress.  This was a long way back in the woods, but I could follow its progress by the bright light. The flashing red light had been replaced, and now there was a very  bright light, moving soundlessly behind the tree line. I wanted to see the light  better and I walked to the edge of the clearing- moving westward, until I had a better view of the light.  It shone very brightly.  As I watched it dazzled my eyes - much like a camera flash but many times brighter. It appeared to me that a beam of light was directed towards me or even at me, slightly above my head to the west.  It appeared to be triangular in shape, very bright and seeming to come in a wave of light.  I felt dizzy and then I become very afraid and ran into the house. My parents own 300 acres in the middle of a strand of thickly wooded forest.  Their land behind the house, where I spotted  the object, has no roads or  houses for many miles, there are only dense woods.  At the very back of the land there is a bare cliff top which sits beside a deep crevice or small  canyon.  The coordinates there, I believe, are 35.753272,-94.851373, if that is indeed the canyon, which is hard to see on the  Google  map.  That would seem to be the only spot where an object might have a clear area to land.  I have not been to this area of interest because of the intense heat and severe allergic reactions to some insect bites. That same night, my mother said she was awakened  by a bright light which she could see out of her bedroom window. She said she sat up in bed,  thinking to herself how odd it was to see a light  back in the woods behind her  house, where no one should or could possibly be. . Since this sighting I have been  noticing some odd precognitive experiences and sensitivities. Effects such as guessing what cards are being dealt, or influencing the fall of the cards more often than usual.  Things like guessing which person out of nine people would win the new car raffle here in my town.  Very vivid and precognitive dreams.  I am further exploring this phenomenon that I seem to be experiencing.  I don’t feel that I am more special than anyone else, and  I realize there are people that will doubt this part of my story.  I believe that they are surely entitled to their own doubts, opinions and thoughts.  My first impulse was to keep this information to myself, because of ridicule. Nevertheless, I feel I should be honest and forthcoming concerning all information on this sighting and be honest and true to myself and posterity.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,,

Myself and four other friends are camping at Diablo Lake near Ross Lake Dam.  We camped at the Diablo Lake Camp ground which is located right off of highway 20.  This camp spot sits at the bottom of two big mountains on either side.  The lake sits in the valley and the camp is on its shore.  When you're on the beach looking up there is a large mountain in front of you.  Our intention of the trip is to get away from the city by going into the mountains to avoid light pollution so we can stargaze. We spent the whole day exploring the area and playing in the water.  By dusk we had settle down around a fire we built on the beach.  The beach came to a point and made a small peninsula out into the lake.  We gathered at the end of the beach and started to look upwards. This was probably around 1030 or 11, as it was mid summer around July and it doesn’t get dark till late in Washington.  By around 230, we had been getting familiar with all the stars and planets, satellite’s in the sky.  It was a beautiful night very clear until the early morning. Someone spotted an object flying over head and pointed to it.  We all turned and looked identifying the object.  At first glance it resembled what a satellite would look like.  However, we had seen many satellites already and this object seemed larger and brighter. So to compare lets say a satellites brightness is on average that of a small stars brightness. Then this object was about twice as bright closer to one of our brighter stars.  It seemed to be either traveling very fast or was very far above the earth (like a satellite) this can make it hard to judge distance with all the stars in the background. It was completely silent as it flew over us.  We noticed it and tracked it over head as it started to pass beyond us.  This was around 6-10 seconds; as it moved south from us it instantly disappeared.  Impressed we all looked around at each other slightly shocked.  Instantly we began to try and debunk what we had seen was it a satellite or maybe the space station!  (Once when i was growing up my family and i watch a space shuttle dock with the international space station.)  We all puzzled over how fast it was moving and how it might have disappeared. This is when things get a little weirder. We continue looking up and chatting about what we had just seen.  Soon after this someone spots something in the distance.  Its two lights at the end of the lake south from where we were and in the direction in which the the object had been traveling.  They are on the other side of the highway near the bridge at bottom of the valley.  These lights are strange one is white and the other is red and they appear to be dancing or bouncing around.  They are about 1/4 mile away and at first it was hard to tell how big these lights were.  They moved through the trees up the hillside and back down around and on top of the water. All of us watched this in aw.  Amazed and confused we tried to speculate what we were seeing.  Soon a car drives by.  The highway comes down one mountain crosses the bridge and and goes up the other side.  As the car passes the bridge we realize how big these lights actually are. To compare these lights were about 4 times bigger than the amount of light made by the headlights of the car.  To be clear they were not 4 times as bright.  They just filled a lot of space with a medium brightness of light. Its hard to explain.  They also seemed somewhat sphere shaped or had a sphere shaped core which imitated light in all directions.  Like i said it was to faraway and to obscure to make out any details. This continued for a couple minutes at which time we began to be slightly concerned about what we were seeming.  The relationship to the car really put into prospective that something strange was going on. After a couple minutes the lights went away back into the trees out of sight. We all went back to looking upwards now our curiosity peaked by what we had just seem. From the same direction the lights were coming from an object appears in the sky.  It's low maybe 1000ft above the ground traveling north parallel to our orientation.  It is below and in front of the mountain before us.  It was hard to tell if it had a shape, all i could make out was a bright white light that enveloped the whole craft.  Brighter than any star and comparable to the brightness of the full moon. It was moving slow and consistently across the sky. As it go closer to us i stepped towards it with my friends behind me.  I asked it a question like do you come in peace or something silly like that.  The object instantly became twice as bright, like a big flash.  Shock i turned around to my friends saying can you believe this $h&! . I turned back to the craft and asked it something like are you hear to meet us.  And craft flashed again just like before. We all watched in utter amazement giggling in disbelief.  The craft passed the mountain and vanished. This is where this story gets more personal.  The rest of this can be verified with the other people i was with however what happens next only happened to me. As we turn to talk about what ever it was we just say i begin to have a very strange sensation. While the rest of people are talking i wonder off and voices start talking to me in my head.  However it's not someone else’s voice, it's my own.  It's like i was talking to myself in my head but there was another me talking too.  This voice keep asking if i would like to be contacted. (this next part is hard to for me to explain)  The hair on the back of my neck stood up and then i began to have essentially flash backs but not into the past, into the future.  I got the sense that i was being shown all the possibilities that were available to me.  In seconds i saw hundreds of different ways this could happen or not happen. This was quite the experience already and i quickly realized that my friends and i were mentally not prepared to handle something like that.  I adamantly said no to direct contact out of fear of the unknown. (Slightly bummed about this in retrospective)  This all happened in a number of seconds.  As soon as it was over I immediately told all my friends. As im describing all this one of my friends gets a similar sensation telling him to lay down and look up. While the rest of are talking, he say that sky opened up with blue light as an object accelerated at extreme speeds out of sight. He gets up and exclaims did you see that!  We all sit by the fire amazed and confused.  We talk for another couple hours.  Hashing out all the details.  We left the next morning.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,,

He said something like “Dad! Look out your window and tell me what you see!!”  He was calling from a friend’s home on US 28 perhaps 15 miles away. I got up and looked out the window immediately viewing a large whitish light at about a 45 degree angle to the west. It was large.  At one point I held my arm at length and compared the light to the width of my thumb.  It as slightly wider and I am 6’ 4” tall with large hands.  My son said that his friend’s dad and girlfriend had left for a small mountain closer to the object near Marquette.  My son said he and some friends wanted to come to our house to get closer to the object and watch the object.  We are up on a high hill a good 200 feet over the surrounding area.  I have a 3 rd story tower  and went up the stairs to look out to the west. I watched the object while I waited for my son.  It stayed in one spot the entire time. ! Eventually my son and a couple of friends arrived.  One had a pair of binoculars.  They thought it looked not much larger than where they watched it the 15 or so miles back to the East.  The light did nothing.  Eventually my teen daughter eventually came home from work and came up to the tower.  She was immediately shocked by the globe of light. We all watched the light perhaps another hour or so. My wife and step son also joined.  I went outside a couple of times to walk down the driveway and to look and listen.  It was absolutely silent.  It looked like white light but sometimes we thought we could see other colors emitted but, if that was the case, it was very subtle and maybe just an artifact. After watching this thing not move for so long we were suddenly alarmed to realize it was starting to move.  It was very slow and steady moving at about the same height off to the west .  After a few minutes it reached a ridge line approximately two miles away. Here it stopped. My son was watching with the binoculars.  He says excitedly,  “Dad...see if you see what I’m seeing” as he handed me the binoculars.  I focused on the object and noticed a very small white globe descending from the larger object and moving down at a perfect trajectory at about 45 degrees to the ground.  At about half way to the tree tops it abruptly turned the opposite direction to the south as it appeared to drop below the trees. Moments later it returned to the main object!  Then the entire object dropped straight down below the back side of the hillside.  We all exclaimed “it gone!”.  But a moment later it came straight back up to about the same height  and began moving to the south where it eventually! disappeared into the distance. People I have told this to say “helicopter”, but there was nothing but silence on a clear starry cold winter night.  And I don’t believe my son could have seen something as small as a helicopter miles away that looked nearly the same side when he arrived at my house.  The small “probe” that dropped from the main object was the strangest part to me.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,46.5172,-87.6034

I zoomed in and at the top there appears to be a single stationary object in the cloud, silver with a very flat top.  Thought it might be just part of the cloud, but never seen a cloud like that.

Kenneth Arnold Mt. Rainier 1947...l. ((name deleted)) Mt. Rainier :present day: James Gilliland Mt. Adams :present day:   Bright flashes and sharp booms were reported in the skies over Western Washington.  Viewers from Lakewood to Camano Island called KIRO 7 Eyewitness News, saying they were awakened by light or the booms.  Witnesses along a 60-mile swath of the Puget Sound region from the Tacoma area to Whidbey Island and as far as 260 miles to the east said the sky lit up brilliantly, and many reported booms as if from one or more explosions.  Jay Neher, a weather service meteorologist, said the agency's radar on Whidbey Island showed nothing unusual but added that the dish could have been pointed at another part of the sky at the time and could not detect objects above about 20,000 feet.  Civilian pilots reported seeing the flash from Ellensburg, east of the Cascade Range, said an FAA duty officer. That night was the first night some friends and myself were witnesses to something extraordinary.  Below are a couple pictures of what a few others and myself still see around a discreet location close to Mt. Rainier, Washington.  also there are pictures from the home of James Gilliland in Trout Lake near Mt. Adams which is about 45 miles NE of Rainier.  There have been thousands of eyewitnesses at what is termed ""the sattva sanctuary, www.eceti.org""... some of which are prominent scientists and physicists.  Astro, nuclear, bio, and plasma physicists have all witnessed this oddity.  Aerospace, Air force design engineers, professional photographers and investigators from around the world have also come to observe the anomaoly.  Most all people however, never get a chance to see them at a close proximity, they usually tend to vanish if approached. James and a handful of others, one of which being myself, have been approached by the Luminous Entities.  I now have had many experiences with these entities.  These are not like Ball Lightning or Earthquake Lights, with which they otherwise seem to share many characteristics, these anomalous lights never occur as the result of any obvious trigger event.  Their terrestrial nature means that although many sightings are sporadic, these entities/ufo's are fact. Trevor James Constable, in a quest to understand better the elusive UFO phenomenon, began using infra-red film in an otherwise ordinary camera.  Constable discovered that ""Infrared film, exposed between dawn and sunrise in high, dry locales will frequently objectify invisible objects of various kinds living in and passing through the atmosphere.  The existence of these organisms seems to be essentially plasmatic, i.e. having their form expressed in heat substance. They travel in pulsatory fashion, swelling and shrinking cyclically as they move through the air..."" ""Being plasmatic, they are capable of returning radar echoes, and often do...Motion pictures we made verify that these plasmatic organisms are capable of velocities and changes in shape and size that render worthless any attempt to handle them with the mechanistic mode of mentation Be they Unidentified Aerial Objects or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, they don't look like machines at all. They look to a biologist horribly like unicelluar lifeforms, complete in some cases with nuclei, nucleoli, vacuoles and all the rest. Some are even amoebic in form....""  Amoebic.  Indeed, it is clear even from the still photographs that these organisms are very like amoebas in shape the bioforms; ""are built of matter of the etheric plane..."" and powered by the life- force, what William Reich calls ""orgone energy"". Their builders are, Constable tells us, a race of intelligent and benign beings, whose world is the same as our world, except it is of a higher vibratory level.  The craft become visible and tangible when they materialise into our own world here are a few places where the events are being seen. Mostly as odd lights on a distant hillside never making any close encounters with watchers and are therefor passed off as natural events of areas with high amounts of energy ""tectonic fault lines"" etc... Throughout history, mountains, monuments, elevated places, known as “High Places” have usually been associated with God and his revelation to man.  Moses, for example, received the laws on a mountain from God.  Hammurabi also received the Code of Hammurabi from God on a mountain.  The tower of Babel was built to reach heaven.  Legend has it that there was a mountain in the center of Atlantis that reached up to heaven.  We build cathedrals and churches that are structurally very high to symbolize our reaching up to heaven. The Great Pyramid is one of the highest structures in the world today and was the highest one in ancient times perhaps another stepping stone to...?",,47.4061,-121.9953

In 1960, when I was a science junkie in Jr. High School, my friend, his Father and I had a strange, inter-active ""ENCOUNTER"" that to this day remains unexplained.  My friend retired from the Air Force and several years ago we met in person after he retired as a career Air Traffic Controller.  Of course, the elephant in the room was our ""encounter"" when we were young teenagers in Avon Lake, Ohio. Our recollection was exactly the same of the event which occurred in the Summer of 1960 shortly after dark.  My friend and I were hanging out in his backyard when we noticed the 3 white lights hovering among the branches of one tree. He went and asked his Father to join us. What the three of us witnessed in Northern Ohio that night was 3 white “lights” hovering among the tree branches 8-10 feet above our heads.  They were within a foot or two of each other.  Their glow could be seen through the tree leaves directly beneath these ""white lights"".  They were about the size of large, round dinner plates and appeared to be almost flat.  There were no other light sources or beams of light in the backyard of my friend’s house. Any other external light sources would have reflected off of the leaves of the tree. Now here is where it gets unbelievable........ A couple times I threw a small rock at one of these 3 ""lights"" and each time the one I aimed at moved to avoid being hit.  Due to the close spacing between these 3 lights, no human(s) operating a light source would have any way of knowing beforehand which light I was trying to hit, and only the light I was trying to hit moved out of the way each time, while the other two hovered without moving.  These “lights” continued to hover until the three of us finally went into our homes for the night. Weather was clear and in the 70’S Residential area Any explanation would be appreciated.",,41.4969,-82.0176

On the night of the 11th, my husband and I were returning from town. Our home is rural (dead center of the DELMARVA Peninsula) with a perfect night sky for star watching, which I do regularly. I stepped out of my truck on the west side facing the Chesapeake Bay. While looking out and upward, I thought I identified Orion’s belt, but I quickly realized that is was 4 stars not 3 and the rest of his body was missing. I looked to the east towards the moon and identified a bright star to its bottom left. I looked back at the 4 stars and realized they were moving. The lights appeared to be far above plane altitudes as there were multiple planes flying in different directions at different altitudes (normal activity). The planes were obvious by their running lights. Additionally, there is a great deal of government activity, regularly, so planes and the associated noise are normal. I began to yell to my husband to “look, look, what is that?” Immediately, in my heart,! I knew it was not earthly. At first, I thought the “star-like lights” were horizontal beside each other, but then I realized they were moving single file, one behind the other. Most important to their movement was the distance between them never wavered. It was if they were connected somehow by material or an unseen force. The first two were closer to one another, and then the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th light were evenly distributed. My first thought on their movement was how the animation of Santa sailing across the sky moves…deliberate, smooth, silent, racing. It was like the lights were a train with an engine car and then individual cars. I was mad at myself for not having my phone, which I had noted earlier when I missed the beaver moon shot on the way to town. I wanted to run to the house to get it, but I was afraid of missing any of this event. The lights appeared to be moving from the south west on a curve directly towards and over our farm. As they moved closer, I ran to th! e house through the west side door, grabbed the phone, and hea! ded out the south side door (mere seconds). I fumbled to get the recorder going as I continued to watch the event unfold. The 4 lights continued what seemed like a curve and headed south east.

We were facing west. We had been sitting there for about 45 minutes when we noticed a well organized, straight line of lights proceeding from right to left, that is, north to south, against the black night sky. There was little separation among them, but they were discriminable.  They were traveling roughly at the speed of airplanes, but what was so striking was how many of the lights there were, and how they were quite well organized into a line. We weren’t sure we could see well all of the ones that were there, partly because the luminosity of some of the lights changed significantly, especially the first and perhaps 3rd and 4th lights, that grew in intensity, and then subsided to that of most of the others.  As they proceeded further south, they all grew dimmer, but some of the ones in the rear dimmed faster than some of the ones in the front.  This definitely was not a meteor of some kind leaving a trail, it was not a descending arc, and the separation among the lights appeared regular. They were flying at what appeared to be the same, level altitude the whole time they were visible.  We pointed them out to the folks sitting next to the RV behind us and they easily confirmed that they could see the same thing we were seeing, a line of what could have been around 15 easily visible lights, led by some that flared up brightly. Not all of the lead lights grew in intensity, just the first and possible the 3rd and 4th, maybe the 5th.  My husband and I disagree on exactly how long they were visible to us, but we watched them until they dimmed so much, apparently because they were more distant, that we could no longer see them.

We were looking for satellites as we often do to see which of us would win the game of seeing the most. Unexpectedly an object of Triangular Shape about the size of a 737 came across the sky roughly ½ mile to our west and approximately 1000 to 1500 feet and traveling very fast and silent. The craft made no noise on a clear and clam night as a front had recently come through. The craft showed no Navigation lights but had several “Puck” type lights under each wing. I believe there were about 6 or 7 that ran the entire length of the craft. The object transitioned the area in about 5 seconds and airliners doing the same distance to the local airport only slightly higher than what we saw take about 17 to 20 seconds.  The “Tail” of this object appeared blurry as though it maintained some type of distortion in that area. I am a former airline pilot and Naval Aviator and I consider myself somewhat educated on airplanes and their characteristics.  This gave both my wife and I “goose bumps.”   I reported this sighting to MUFON and they blew it off as a B-2.  I have seen many B-2’s over my time… many.  Their engines produce noise and the airframe has a similar but not the same geometry.  MUFON stated it was a B-2 on its way to MacDill.  I was a young Naval Aviator …21 years old and full of myself.  I would never have risked my career by running 1000 feet above a very populated area with no required navigation or landing lights.  MacDill is about 67 Miles to my North…. Running through this densely populated area with no lights other than these dim puck type lights under the wing would be a court martial offense in this day and age.  I think MUFON did not do a proper job in their analysis. I would be very interested in what you think.  Recently I was watching a program called Unacknowledged and at the 1;26 minute mark….. or close to it, they show a craft that is a very close approximation to what my wife and I saw.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,26.98100661157025,-82.11690661157024

As I entered East University Drive from a parking lot, I noticed two lights on the horizon to the south of my position which I assumed to be an incoming flight to Albany International Airport.  However, this was west of the typical flight paths that I often observed, and it appeared to be dropping illuminated objects.  Suspecting this to be an aircraft in distress, I quickly drove into the football stadium parking lot for a better look.  By this time it was almost about to pass me, but then I observed that each illuminated object was separated and moving in tandem.  The second object continued to drop illuminated objects at intervals.  These were silent. Fortunately, I captured the objects (and another drop of illuminated objects) via iPhone 8 video as they were passing me and heading north.  The treeline can be seen with a bright monitor, as well as the corner of SEFCU Arena at the end of the video. Puzzled by what I had witnessed, I enlarged one of the objects with my video editing program — but it's just as mysterious.  The original file and the magnified file are in these Dropbox links.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/8t4pkv1ejxw3xc6/Video%20Oct%2010%2C%2011%2040%2042%20PM.mov?dl=0  https://www.dropbox.com/s/pmiyoxmve2kdvs6/UFO_Over_Guilderland_Closeup_Flashes.mov?dl=0  Based on incoming airline flights to Albany International Airport, I would estimate these to be 2,500 to 4,500 feet. A Times Union city desk editor called a spokesperson at the airport to inquire about craft in the area on this date and time. Two weeks later, the contact responded the airport had no information about these objects in its airspace.  Because the objects were to my right (heading north), I would estimate them to be traveling over part of Guilderland — which borders Albany.  One of the Times Union's reporters contacted a professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy for assistance, but he was too busy last spring. So, I'm filing the report here.

Just disappeared. At 9:00 PM on May 15th, 2019, I was driving on SR155 eastbound, between Ashland City and White’s Creek.  I saw a large object in front of me off to the left side in my windshield and it was lit up.  At first I thought it was a helicopter just hovering over the treeline.  This was not way up in the sky, this was just over the tree line.  As I kept driving, I began to see more lights on this and since the sky was not fully dark, I could see the entire outline of the shape of the object and immediately knew this was not a helicopter, and it was sitting completely still.  This was a long oval shaped disc, and it was not sitting horizontally to the ground, it was tilted up on it’s side, like diagonal.  So I could see the top of it facing the highway I was on.  It had many bright lights on it – white, red, blue, green, yellow and was really quite beautiful. I was talking on the phone with my husband at the time, and he could just hear me saying Oh My God over and over and it rendered me quite speechless to even be able to tell him what I was seeing, as it was hitting me just what I was witnessing.  I kept describing it to him and as I drove, it sat completely still, I heard no noise and now as I am driving it is now in my side driver’s window as I looked out.  I thought about pulling over to take a picture, but it wasn’t safe to do so on this road and this thing was really too close, I didn’t want to stick around.  I kept looking back and forth from the road to my window, and at some point, I looked at the road and then looked back in the direction of the object and it was just gone.  All the lights were gone, everything gone and nowhere to be seen. I have never witnessed anything like this in my life.  It really was beautiful, a little scary at the same time, and very close to the treetops, not even way up in the air, so very easy to see.  Much larger than what a helicopter or anything would be, so it was not a drone.  This was definitely some sort of a large craft, very lit up, and sitting completely still, at an angle.",2019-06-07T00:00:00,36.2833,-87.0121

After a period of around 8 seconds, it just sat there, then all of the sudden a second object appears,  But I don't think it was a UFO, it looked somewhat like a plane. It had wings like an airplane, But there was something strange, they weren't moving. and they were in the sky at around 135 degrees South West, and all of the sudden, the second object, which was the one that looked like an airplane, faded away to the direction of the first object and this took around 5 seconds, but which felt very slow, and after these seconds, the 2nd object disappeared and after around 10 seconds, the first object, faded away at the same speed as it got bright.  I would describe the first object as being like a star, like the north star, circular, but I couldn't see the object clearly because of how bright it was, the light was the same as a star, but it couldn't be a star because how early it was and my street is kind of light polluted, so you can't see stars until relatively late at night.

This terrifies me, because i've never thought they'd be real but they are.  And I know I am not lying, and i'm still terrified from this event.  I don't care if you don't believe it's real, but I know it in my heart an mind that I saw this, and something I will never forget. Now I know that we are not alone, and no one can take this knowledge away from my heart, such a terrifying sight it was.

UFO hovers over car and chases it aggressively.  ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.

At the beginning of the trip (approx. Aug. 15, 1971) I was feeling very well-rested and energized and I planned to drive all night if I still felt good around midnight.  About that time, I was in the Denver metropolitan area and was using I-70.  I loaded up on snacks and coffee and, since I still felt very alert and energized, I decided to go ahead and drive all night. After Denver, the traffic on I-70 thinned out dramatically.  In fact, before too long, in the wee hours of the morning, I noticed I was indeed the ONLY car on the highway.  Somewhere on I-70, about midway between Denver and the Kansas border (Lincoln County?), at approximately 3:00a.m., I encountered an unusual spotlight above my car which, as it descended closer to my car, became extremely bright red-orange in color.  It was so bright one could actually read a newspaper in the car.  It was so bright, I considered it a safety issue since, surrounded by all this light, I could not see the road ahead as clearly as before.  I was absolutely terrified. I was hoping this thing above my car was just an errant helicopter – but the characteristic sound of the rotors was entirely absent.  There was, in fact, no sound at all.  Also absent was the expected downward gusts generated by rotor blades.  What terrified me even more was that the craft seemed to mimic my every move, in terms of speed and lane shifting – and it was done in a very menacing way, in my opinion. I have identified the shape of the craft as “unknown” because my 1964 Chevy Impala was a hardtop and I could see nothing directly above.  If the light from the object was any indication of size and shape, it encircled my car entirely and was substantially wider and longer than my Chevy. In an attempt to break away from this object (that appeared to be chasing me), I gunned the gas pedal and went to over 100m.p.h.  I traveled at this high rate of speed for approx. 3 to 4 minutes – but to no avail since the craft seemed to have the ability to “lock on” to my every movement seamlessly and without fail. Suddenly, I noticed ahead of me the tail lights of another car.  I moved along and passed the other car and, at that very moment, the craft disappeared just as quickly as it first appeared. I am considering the driver of the other car as an additional witness as I am very sure he/she must have seen EVERYTHING in the rear-view mirror, probably including the exact size and shape of the thing.  I think it is interesting to note that the other driver tried to remain close to me so neither of us was entirely alone.  We passed each other in a leap-frog manner until daybreak was close at hand.  At that point, I turned off I-70 into what was the last Colorado rest area before Kansas.  The other car continued eastward. I refreshed myself, rested awhile, and continued eastbound on I-70 after dawn (6:00a.m.?) – without further incident. NOTE: I have never discussed this with anyone, except for my immediate family, and would like to continue to remain anonymous going forward.",2020-01-31T00:00:00,,

She was laying down on the couch with the bottom of her feet facing the TV and I was sitting perpendicular to the TV so the TV was on my right. Behind the TV we have a wall of books, we called that room the library. I got up to go to the kitchen and when I walked through the doorway, I had an urge to look out the hallway window on my left, honestly for no reason.  I looked out the window, looked up the driveway and saw lights at the top of the trees like someone was driving down the road but instead of the headlights being just above the road like they would be, these lights were at the top of the tree line, above the trees.  I thought it was so weird because it was kind of going a little bit slow and I thought a car would be much faster so I keep looking out the window and the light passed the top of the trees at the top of the driveway and went over to my left and next to our house on the left is our top lawn, which is probably about 2k ft. in length. It was just silent and black hovering over the trees on our top lawn.  The beam from the bottom shined down on the top of the trees so it was probably 20 or 30 feet above the top of the trees.  I started freaking out, my heart started racing, my gut instinct was that it was definitely a UFO.  I never had experienced anything like this before.  I started freaking out some more then went right back to the couch to the same exact place where I was a minute before and literally had a hard time breathing because I was so scared. I just wanted it to go away.  About 2 to 3 minutes later there was a beam of light that started shining through our window, like scanning the wall from left to right.  The window was to the left of me behind my mom's head.  It's a bay window where there are 3 sections, left, center and right.  The middle/center window had the beam of light like a flashlight shining in the house.  The scanning started from the top left corner and started scanning the wall/books left to right top to bottom very slowly and I turned to look out the window and I saw three figures standing there that were dark but I saw them all standing next to each other. The one in the middle had the flashlight and did the scanning of the bookshelf left to right across the books. I literally had a hard time breathing and I said to my mom oh my God Mom do you see that light and she said yes, stop, you are scaring me. I basically just closed my eyes and held my breath and waited for that moment to pass and finally opened my eyes looked up and there was finally nothing. I got up and looked out the window and they were gone thank God. Still to this day I cannot believe I experienced that and for a long time after that happened I kept Googling aliens and cancer and wondered why they came literally directly to our house.They had to walk down a slight hill to get to our window. We did have the lights on in the library and they did go straight to that middle window so they knew there was something in there. Still to this day I don't know if they saw me sitting on the couch or not or if they saw the back of my mom's head. There were wooden Bermuda blinds that were halfway up the window so I could only see there heads. I think it was just dark where the eyes and nose would be. It looked like they were a smooth gray and short like 4 or 5 feet tall. I wonder why they came to the the window I don't! know why they were scanning the bookshelf but the light never made it over to the couch which was on the far right of the room where my mom and I were sitting so maybe they didn't see us or maybe they just wanted to leave us alone, I'll never know. I just turned to stone when I saw that light going across the bookshelf though scanning the bookshelf wall. They must have seen the TV on because they had a clear view of the TV. I'm sure they could see in the whole room. It really just freaks me out just thinking about what happened. And like I said I still wonder why they came literally right to our house to the top of the trees and why they came down to the house and I literally thought for months and years afterwards,""Were they there because my mom had cancer?"" Does anybody know if there is any correlation between aliens and cancer? Like I said I Googled 4 months afterwards aliens and cancer and found nothing about it. Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I don't like talking about it, thinking about it or really telling anyone this story. It is so bizarre to me and honestly scared the living daylights out of me. I'm so thankful they didn't take me and I'm thankful I don't have any missing time or anything like that. Maybe they just didn't see us sitting on the couch from the angle they were at. I read a story on here that somebody had an encounter with the same type of extraterrestrial, a gray with smooth skin about 5 ft tall. I was not on drugs nor drunk when I experienced this, there was nothing in my system at all. I didn't really talk to my mom about this afterwards she did see the light scan the bookshelf but she too was so freaked out. When my dad came home that night I told him everything even though it obviously sounded like I was crazy, however I was so shaken up I'm pretty sure he knows I truly experienced this very scary night.  My Mom died less than 2 months later. She was never a smoker either.  Unfortunately, I had two more ufo experiences after my mom died, both the following year, in 2005.  I will share those as well in two different posts since they were two different encounters.  Please reach out if anyone has experienced anything similar to anything like this, thanks.",2020-01-31T00:00:00,,

Off to the right edge of my windshield I noticed a flashing light come into my field of view.  It was traveling from my right side to the left, its direction of travel was to the north-east.  Because I was traveling 70mph down the hwy I could tell its distance from me was less than a mile, when I first saw it to the end I had gained distance on it and it seemed closer than at the beginning. 	So the light was pulsing in a binary condition, meaning full on and fully off at about 4-5Hz (times a sec), and the on period was the same as the off period, it wasn't like the flash strobe of an airplane where you have the quick flash, then long off period and the quick flash again.  The light stayed the same throughout the sighting. 	The path of the light went pretty much horizontally from my right, over above the field to the right of the hwy, crossed over the hwy and over to the left side of the highway over some wooded area roughly 1/2mi off the hwy taking approx 4-5 seconds, it was moving very quickly. It was very low the entire time, I estimate it to be below 500ft.  My work base is very close to MSN airport and I see air traffic everyday at low altitude, I also know it is against the rules to fly that low (below 500ft agl) without a really good reason.  While the light was to my left just over the wooded area 5-6 bright lights dropped from the original flashing light, this took less then a second.  These lights were constantly lit and they seemed to fall strait down until they were now obscured by the trees in the forest. 	I am now watching this from my side window, with the window down.  Almost immediately after the lights dropped, the original flashing light turns its direction of travel to near vertical and keeps climbing until it looks like it goes into the clouds and I cant see it anymore.  The 90 degree turn was very quick and it didn't appear to be in an arc at all, it was just suddenly going up.  During this time its so close I had to stick my head out the window to look up to keep it in my sight. 	During this whole thing I'm thinking this is an F-16, and I try to hear the engine, and I should have been able to see the glow of the exhaust.  I don't hear anything or see the exhaust, I've been to a few airshows and when jets go into a vertical climb it is very loud below it, and their pretty much giving it full throttle to maintain that climb.  I also know that I can hear F-16's taking off while I'm driving my truck with the windows rolled up as it is quite a frequent occurrence when I am driving near MSN/Truax field.  I watch them takeoff at night sometimes and they always have a white strobe and their red/green wing lights along with orange glowing exhaust. 	After I couldn't hear the engine, that's when I realized I needed to note the time and my location.  I knew Volk field was somewhat near so that night I looked it up, turns out its actually over 55mi from where I was.  Google maps sat view only shows farm fields, no bombing ranges. And if it was a jet fighter dropping flares, why was it flying a few hundred feet above hilly ground dropping flares into a wooded patch in a farmers field surrounded by farm houses less then a mile away from an interstate highway in near pitch dark.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,44.4073,-91.0442

Thank you for allowing me to share my own story. Back in July 1969, I was a teenager of 16 yrs old. I was lying in bed semi-asleep, when a high-pitched sound started. This sound was like a pure sinewave tone, I would estimate around 10Khz to 15Khz. I thought it was the cheap table fan on the small table by the window - it was a hot night. So I went to shut it off, thinking the motor maybe needed oiling, and I'd do that the next day. My parents and sisters were alseep in their rooms, and I didn't want to wake them by going down the squeaky stairs to the basement for oil. When I shut the fan off, the noise continued, and seemed to come from outside. I walked over to the window, which was open, and looked out. What I saw was utterly amazing to me! Hovering motionless over Mr Allen's roof which was about 150 feet away, was this globe-like thing. It was about 5 or 6 feet in diameter, perfectly round, and was a dark greyish semi-shiney color. It just hovered there, not moving, and I kept hearing that ""whistle/tone"" that I mentioned before. There were no lights on it. I went to my parents bedroom and woke my mom up, but she complained that I was goning to wake my dad up - I told her to come to my room, she refused and told me to go back to bed and shut up. So I went back to my bedroom, and sat by the window, watching that thing, amazed by it. After about 20 minutes, it literally flew straight up in the air and disappeared, and instantly that sound stopped, like turning off a switch. The speed of this thing was almost instant, like 500 miles an hour I would guess. It just vanished! I weant back to bed, lay there and eventaully drifted off to sleep. But I'll never forget what I saw, and I know it wasn't a dream, because the next day mom confronted me about waking her up the night before. I've talked about this to others, and the usual response was typical - thay I was making this story up. But I know better. I'm not dumb. Thanks again for allowing me to share this.",2019-10-04T00:00:00,39.99063505273804,-75.14580121369744

Suddenly a light bulb went off and I began to put two and two together regarding an incident which my wife and I experienced in Wayne, New Jersey around the same time as the North Bergen incident.  My personal experience that night has stayed so fresh in my mind, so much so that I can replay it as if it happened yesterday, even after all these years.  After watching that TV episode, my curiosity got the best of me and I Googled ..”UFO sightings in New Jersey 1975” and the details of that siting appeared. Let me review some background specific information about myself.  I think you will agree that I am an exceptionally reliable and credible source with particular training in careful observation due to my chosen career.  I graduated from University in March of 1972 and received an appointment to the FBI Academy in June 1972.  After completing my 16 weeks of training, as a newly minted Special Agent, I was transferred to my first assignment and during early fall of 1974 I received new orders to the New York City division of the FBI.  Since my wife and I had friends who lived in Wayne, N,J we decided to settle in that area and decided I would commute into NYC daily.  We found an apartment in Cedar Grove and settled in. After my commute home late one afternoon in Spring 1975, I asked my wife if she was up for a drive over to a Mall on Hamburg Turnpike in Wayne where there was an Arthur Treacher’s Fish & Chips.  She agreed and we set out, making our way from Cedar Grove down Route 23 and finally over to Valley Road in Wayne.  As we were about a quarter mile from the intersection of Hamburg Turnpike and Valley Road my wife looked over at me with a surprised look on her face pointing up to the right and says... “There’s a UFO.” Being a died in the wool skeptic at the time, at least until verifiable facts present themselves directly before my eyes, I laughed and said.... “Yeah, right!”  She leaned forward and pointed up and slightly to the right, and said, “No, right there, see.”  Deciding to humor her, I leaned forward and looked up to where she was pointing, and there, suspended slightly above the tree line was this classically shaped, windowless, silver metallic, dome topped disk, with lights rotating around the rim at the bottom of the disk.  Needless to say, with those obvious facts before my very eyes in real time the consummate skeptic in me quickly became a true believer. Being a competently trained investigator, I needed to take a closer look at this one-of-a-kind event and we drove almost directly under the disk (it made no discernible sound or disturbance as we passed beneath the object), then straight through the intersection of Valley Road and Hamburg Turnpike where I took the first left into a bank’s parking lot. I drove to the nearest vantage point to the object in the parking lot adjacent to Hamburg Turnpike where my wife and I exited the car and stood on a grass strip at the corner of the intersection with an unobstructed view of the object as it made a slow deliberate approach towards us, parallel to Valley Road.  I must say, this was the first time in my life I have stood and observed something that left me speechless; speechless, but not devoid of the ability to make rational judgements about the nature of what I was observing. As we stood there, I made some very careful mental observations about its shape, dimensions, and the slowly advancing flight path it made towards us.  There was no panic on our part, just simple curiosity in our observations.  I have pulled up some Google Earth satellite views of the area and attached them as illustration.  I marked the slow flight path of the object and our location in the parking lot on the scans.  The entire event took perhaps half an hour at most from first sighting until, quite frankly, we became bored with the entire episode after the object slowly moved behind some buildings, and went on our way to the restaurant with, not surprisingly, with a new attitude towards UFO sightings and what lies beyond our little pathetic shell here on Earth. Let me say this, the object moved slowly and deliberately as if it was merely making normal anthropological research observations of a newly discovered species, and apparently the occupants did not give a royal ho! ot who saw their hovering craft.  There were no fancy gyrations or blindingly fast departures, no electrical disturbances, no static discharges, no blinding bright lights, no strange sounds, no little green men peering from windows, just a gravity defying, hovering, metallic, slowly moving, classically shaped UFO disk in plain unobstructed daylight. I estimated the object to be approximately 30 feet in diameter and perhaps half that in height from base to the top of the dome, with a classic slightly elongated UFO saucer shape.  During my observation the object remained at just above tree top level and during the end of the observation it was suspended above the northern edge of the parking lot of a shopping mall opposite the Wayne Village Apartments.  The time of day was late afternoon, with excellent visibility, and the observation ended just before darkness fell.  There were no observable windows or exterior markings, no radical movements, no protrusions of any kind from the body of the craft, no little men waving from windows, and absolutely no sounds I could discern associated with the object.  There was a series of colored neon like lights which traveled randomly around the very outermost circumference of the base of the disk which appeared to be integrated into the structure rather than attached to it in any obser! vable fashion.  The lights would meet at random places on the disk, split apart, and reverse directions only to return from opposite directions and meet at another random spot, again splitting apart, repeating the cycle.  Being a consummate plane spotter and having taken private pilot flight lessons, I knew this was not any terrestrial craft I was familiar with, and at one point I recall a TWA Boeing 727 flew directly over the object on its approach to a landing at Newark Airport.  I could easily see the TWA logo illuminated on the tail of the aircraft.  Once the object got even with Lancaster Court it paused, made a turn, and proceeded down Lancaster Court where it finally disappeared from sight. My last recollection of the object was a backlit side view illuminated by the setting sun and the object was at or slightly above the the level of the two story apartment buildings proceeding on a casual level course.  I recall thinking anyone who happened to be gazing out those second! story apartment windows certainly would have been in for a real treat  By this time our evening meal of Fish & Chips was long overdue.  I looked at my wife and said: “Well, that settles that argument!”  We both laughed.  I do recall a story sometime later in the Star Ledger which detailed the observations made by bank customers at a People’s Bank regarding a sighting very similar to ours of a silver disk which was observed in Vineland, New Jersey.  I believe that incident is listed in this sites incident reports.",2019-10-04T00:00:00,40.94856006006006,-74.24151141141141

I left the library at UNC-Greensboro just about 10 pm to drive home to Thomasville, NC. I drove to Old 85 at Holden Road and headed south toward Thomasville. Immediately when I got on Old 85 I saw a bright orb in the sky far away to the south but along the path of the highway. The light was mesmerizing. I watched it intently as I drove the approximately 19 miles home. I did not even listen to the radio (unusual). I watched as the orb would disappear as I went down hills and reappear then I got up the hills. I assume it was just above the tree line. The orb grew brighter and larger.  After passing the Jacob street overpass on old 85, approaching the Highway crossover at the Paradise Hotel. As I approached I could see the orb was a machine hovering the the air just about the treeline. I was shocked and pulled my car onto the crossover there on 85. When I pulled in there was a 18 wheeler parked there in the me! dian at the crossover. I parked my car and got out of my car all the while watching the machine. When I got out I saw the truck driver of the parked truck standing in the crossover. I stood next to him and closely observed the hovering machine. It was saucer shaped with windows around the edge of the saucer and lights below the windows. The lights were red blue green and they came on and went off making it look like they were going around the rim of the machine. The windows were backlit. As we both stared at it in it’s silence we had not spoken a word to each other. I broke the silence and said “ Do you see that too? Do you hear anything? What is it” the truck driver said I see it but don’t believe it. It’s making me feel crazy. I don’t hear anything”. We were both calm but amazed and stunned by what we were seeing and not hearing.  I noticed the bottom of the machine was a smooth bowl shaped and was glowing an amber color. We both were just staring. Suddenly the silhouette! of a small big headed body walked to a window and seemed to l! ook down at us. I was shocked. The first thing I felt was fear. I don’t know why. I said, “What does it want?” and the truck driver said, I hope it’s not hungry.” We both panicked at the same time and ran to our vehicles and drove away in fear. I was uncanny how we both decided to leave suddenly at the same time. It did not seem like we stood there long but it took me an extra 45 mins. to get home that night. Lost time, I guess. The next night there was a huge multicar wreck at the very same place. I imagined the machine must have come back and caused the wreck. I have told only a few people about this because it sound crazy. My close encounter of the 3rd kind changed my life.

It was just above the tree line, just hoovering and it was massive. I slowed the vehicle down and was sticking my head out the window all while hugging the curb and bouncing off of it, trying to look up in the sky and yelling oh my god what the &^&(768@ is that!  What was weird as there was no one around, no cars, nothing when this was happening.  It was silent, it was a dead silence, you could only hear us and the engine of my vehicle and my wheels hitting the curb as I tried to drive with one hand while my head was out the window looking up. The UFO made no sound.  Me and my friend were hysterical and were yelling back and forth at each other, oh my god what is that! what is that! We couldn't believe what we were seeing.  Then out of nowhere ! on the opposite side of this road, a car came.  So naturally we started yelling at this person at the top of our lungs, LOOK UP LOOK UP! But there was no response he just kept driving by us, as I was waving my arm out the window trying to get his attention and motioning to him to look up!  It was a man, he looked elderly and had his windows rolled all the way up, which we thought was strange on a hot night in the summer in the 80's in an old car that looked like a dodge swinger.  This all happened in a time frame of maybe 2-7 mins. After the car drove by my friend yelled over to me, let's get out of here before we get beamed up! I said Yeah good idea! We nervously laughed and I pulled my head in the window and stepped on the gas and took off up the hill to the traffic lights.  We got to the light were high meets Main Street and the light was Red and there was no one around, it was like a ghost town it was eerie. We were so freaked out we decided we better just go through it! and get out of there, so we just went through the red light t! o get aw ay. After we calmed down for a bit maybe 15 minutes, we decided to go to a friend's house that lived nearby the area to tell the news, as we could not believe what just happened. We got to his/her house and over an hour and half passed and we forgot all about the incident and then all of a sudden it dawned on us and we couldn’t believe we had forgotten, because it was something, we both just witnessed and was unbelievable!  But once our memory came back, we all decided to all get in the car and go looking again for the UFO, lucky we never saw it again. Just for the record, I never believed in UFO’s at all, not until that summer night. I will never forget it and this story is true.",2019-10-04T00:00:00,41.971448571428574,-70.97669714285713

Going left , then right as if searching for something, hovering in the sky.  When it did not get anything in that area it suddenly got speed and left a red trail behind for approx 3 seconds. The light now shifted to another area.  It was heading up towards a tower and continued to beep after every second.  The beep I refer is the continued disappearance and reappearance of light. Now it changed its colour to white for at least 5-6 seconds and then again blue.  As i got near a tower, it stayed there for a while approximately 6-7 seconds and then it started to faint.  The light got dim and completely disappeared. The event, by my approximation happened a mile away.  There was no sound that came to me.  This event just freaked me out.  Also this is not a joke or a hoax to be ignored.  Also I can well distinguish between a mysteriously flying object or some laser light. Wishing for your support.",2019-06-07T00:00:00,,

I was sitting with my girlfriend at the dinner table listening to the radio getting ready to turn in.  We have expansive plate glass windows facing SE offering a good view of the mountain opposite and a good deal of the sky above.  It was a largely clear night, moon within 24 hours of full, high in the SW.  She told me to look up to the South where I saw a silent highly luminous object (not reflecting but emitting light), the brightest object in the sky, so bright no shape could be discerned save that of any bright source of light (like a star), no larger than a small single engine plane.  We watched as it crossed very slowly perhaps no more than a few hundred feet overhead moving in a unerring easterly direction.  We exited the house to watch as it passed into the distance in complete silence.  At more than a mile’s distance we began to hear the very low rumble of a jet engine, a sound th! at a commercial flight would make very far off on the horizon.  To our surprise it was a four engine jet with minimal running lights moving in the same path as that of the still visible object.  I say surprising because it was so low; low enough, I dare add, to actually read lettering on the wings if it had any to read in the daylight.  It was NOT a commercial airliner - much too low and quiet for that.  What’s more, the wings were far up on the fuselage directly behind the cockpit, meaning it was built for speeds beyond that of any commercial craft of that size.  It WAS a military aircraft, and it WAS following at roughly the same speed and altitude as the object with no apparent intent to close the distance or intercept this UFO until both slipped over mountain on the eastern horizon.",2019-06-07T00:00:00,,

I always go outside in the morning. Where I live I typically see many airplanes every day. I think, but am not certain, that there are at least two airports over the hills across from my front porch, but they are pretty far away. The airplanes are easily identified and even if there are military planes running drills in the area, they are easily indentified and are all objects/vehicles I have seen dozens of times over my life. What I saw this particular morning, was not any of these vehicles, it was something truly strange. When I walked outside that morning, it was partially cloudy, but you could still see large sections of the still starry sky. What initially drew my attention was a unique cluster of shooting stars, they were in a group of three with one ahead of the other two, almost in a formation like how ducks or geese fly. I thought it was pretty cool as I see shooting stars all the time, but never in this type of grouping. The whole sighting of the shooting stars literally lasted less than 15 seconds. Immediately following this though there was an odd series of lights that came out from behind a cloud. I assumed the object to be very high in the sky as it was quite far being above the clouds and the object was a little bit larger than the shooting stars. I do not know, but personally do not believe, that the shooting stars and this object had anything to do with one another, it was just coincidental, at least in my opinion. As for the appearance of the object, it was quite weird. I could not tell if I was looking at the underside of an object, an object on its side, or a side view of a flat object. Closer to the ground seemed to be a very bright yellow light with glints of red emitting from it, but it reminded me of an upside down lightbulb. This light was constant and was not blinking, it was not the same brightness or consistency of the airplane or helicopter lights I have seen all the time. If this was the only part of it, I probably wouldn't have given much thought other than thinking it was a little strange, but the rest of the object was really odd. It looked like an almost ""sail"" shape, like you see on a child's toy sailboat. There were many multicolored lights, the lights were constantly on and did not blink. They also changed color, but more like they faded from one color to a different color, not like Christmas lights, it's hard to explain. They were in the colors of red, ye! llow, orange, a bluegreen color, and a sort of teal blue color. There weren't any of the lights that ever blinked, they all stayed constant, with the exception of the sail lights that would change to other colors by some sort of process that I guess is like color changing. It's hard to explain. In any case, I think we are under or at least can view, a pretty heavy air traffic lanes, I see aircraft and vehicles alot, this object was not any of those. It did not make a sound, or at least none that I could hear, what with it being so far away or high in the sky. It moved quickly across and then another cloud obscured my view and I did not see it again. I waited for about ten minutes and even though the clouds moved on, I did not see the object anymore. I have not seen it before and I have not seen it since. I am not sure what it was, but I did think it was important for there to be some record that someone somewhere saw this object.",2019-12-19T00:00:00,39.3335,-83.0168

What was I doing at the time? Picking up a friend from work with a car full of people (5 people) I was sitting in the (back seat in between my friends. Which made me the last to see what my friends started yelling out “UFO it’s a UFO”! I didn’t see it until I demanded the driver to pull over so I can get out and see what the fuzz was about. ASI got out of the car and began to look up at the sky I saw it.  It was almost Orange but like the color of a street light.  And the light looked as if it had a light on it. (Not like a light that shines out of it) like nothing I've ever seen the craft was a cross shaped craft with the nose and tale shape shifting. What was it doing when I saw it: Flight normal or a minute but it clearly was not a plane as you could see the angles of the arms of the cross perfectly.  Yet the nose and tale would change for being squared to rounded off.  This was a cross like the one Jesus is on with the head as the nose and the tail as the feet.  (Laying down not standing up)then it started moving in a  way I can’t explain.  Until finally turning into a orb after flying in some weird pattern back into space”  The first person to see it was the passenger seat (guy getting of work) he explains how it first caught his eye.  “It was a star like object that began to get brighter until forming into what I saw and explained. WHY AM I REPORTING THIS NOW.  Because I can’t go a night without looking up in the sky and wondering what it was that I saw.  I reported it back then and saw one other report of the same thing which I mentioned. End note.   I’m am forever changed by this event.  Nothing was said on local news and very little was I able to find about it.  I got no pictures cause I had no cell phone at the time. Know I’m seeing more and more about this craft. I’ve read so far that Area 51 has a plane supposedly cross shaped and it was still being learned about by the people at Area 51. I’m not saying what I saw was this craft but from what I gathered from the report it does sound the same. I’ve never seen anything in my life shape shift so I am still curious about it being man made. Cross ufo are on the rise I believe it could aliens or our government agencies experimenting with learn about this technology. I’m not at all surprised to say reports about cross ufos are almost all the same description to the tee most of the time.   Was it the sign of the cross cause looking back a the ufo battle in ancient pictures you can see a iron cross type craft in the battle above the skies they described. Please contact me if y! our interested as I can’t get this out of my mind to this very day,2020-01-31T00:00:00,,

I am a retired school teacher of 42 years.  I have an MEd in Administration and Supervision.  I am 74 years old. On Monday, July 1, this year, I was on my deck attached to my home.  At approx. 21:00, I was watching the sky at dusk, watching commercial airliners fly directly over my home, flying east to west.  My home is directly under airliners' flights apparently from Philadelphia/New York to the west coast.  As an airliner went across the sky, I saw an object off to the side of it.  At first, I thought it was a star and didn't pay any attention to it.  As the plane moved forward, I saw this ""object"" start to move at about a ninety degree angle directly toward what I realized was an intersect point with the plane.  Now, I could see that the object was not a star as it was close to the earth.  The object had ball-like pieces that moved around as the object moved toward the plane.  The balls were different colors with three white ones that moved around the outside of the others.  From where I stood, the object was going to run directly into the plane.  The plane continued, the object stopped as the plane passed, evidently the two were not at the same altitude.  The object then made a ninety-degree left turn at an apparent high rate of speed.  If the plane was moving at 400 mph, the object was moving at about the same rate toward the plane, made that turn, then followed the plane at the same speed for a short time.  At that point, I became aware that the object was not alone.  A second, similar object ""appeared,"" and I say appeared because it was not there a second before.  The second object was farther to the east.  It was not as well ""put together"" as the first as the second had similar round parts, but they were not organized into a shape as the first was.  The second approached the flight path of the plane but behind it.  The object seemed to get organized as the lights formed, it appeared, a flat object.  The object followed the plane, apparently tracking it or staying behind it, toward the west until it disappeared.  In th! e meantime, the first object moved erratically in one place wh! ere it s topped following the plane, the ball-like structures moved around inside the shape, changed colors, and appeared to form a large sphere-shaped object that was ""rolling.""  After maybe fifteen minutes, the object began to move upward, away from the Earth.  Today, thirty-five days later, the object ""sits"" in the sky in the same place, but much farther away from the Earth.  It sits there, still observable with the un-aided eye, with the ""balls"" of light moving around in random motion.  And, the total object, moves, apparently randomly, from my observation point, left, right, up and down in the sky.  A second object, I do not know if it is the same second object as I saw the first night, now sits at apparently the same altitude but more to the western sky.  Its movement is observable left, right, up, and down, apparently random.  Its balls of light move in the same way as the first object.   I have observed these objects nightly when it is not too hazy or cloudy.  The first one is in the same place as the first night, and the second object sits at about the same place as it was after tracking the plane.  Am I nuts?  No.  I am observing an obviously controlled object in the sky.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,39.96327543160691,-76.71886879150067

I saw a multi color lighted saucer shaped thing hovering silently just 10-15 feet away. It was no more than 1.5 feet in diameter.  I thought someoneone had a neat remote controlled flying saucer.  I watched it when suddenly it flew away at a high rate of speed, faster than what seemed possible.  I remember watching it fly several several blocks thinking that where I perceived it to be, at this distance, I shouldn't be able to see it anymore. It also may have appeared grey at this distance.  Then it was gone. I sat there thinking did this just happen? What was this?  The moment was gone, and I wished I could have it back, it was just too strange. I still think about this today.  In reading my above description in 2019 I think it may have been up to 3 feet in diameter.  It had colored lights, it was hovering near the ground, so I was looking down it.  From this position it flew several houses up the street and stopped suddenly still displaying lights.  It then flew to another position further away, again stopped suddenly and at this time it appeared a dull silver gray.  It then darted off in yet another direction and was gone.

I can’t say exactly why I waited so long to seek feedback except that it was nearly 30yrs ago, there weren’t near the resources then, if there were, I wasn’t aware of them and this isn’t a subject I felt I could talk to just anyone about without feeling I’d be thought of as a lunatic. I was 20yrs old at the time and lived off the North fork in Tampico, WA. I worked the swing shift 20+ miles from my home in Tampico. I made the long drive every single night at the same time (between 11:30 and 1am) and had never experienced anything like this prior to or since. In case you aren’t familiar with the area, there used to be a stop sign off of Ahtanum road when you arrive in Tampico. There was/is a little convenience store almost directly in front of the stop sign, maybe to the left a slight bit. At the stop sign, you can turn left, to go up the South fork, or turn right to go up the North fork. This particular evening as I began slowing down and pulled up to the stop sign, I looked to my left to see if any cars were coming, I didn’t see a single car on the road but what I did see instantly overwhelmed me with fear like I had never felt before. I felt like I was seeing something that I absolutely wasn’t supposed to see. There were 3 very large, approximately 15ft tall, round objects. All blocking the road to the south fork. I’m pretty sure I would not have been able to drive up the South fork if I needed to. Needless to say, I didn’t stop at the stop sign that night. I slowly continued on my way and took a slight right and drove up the North fork to my home. I didn’t see any lights on/in/around these objects. I didn’t see any humans or other lifeforms around the objects. They were all 3 different colors, but I don’t remember now what colors they were. There was absolutely nothing going on around them that I could see, just dark and silent. I remember thinking I shou! ld go home and wake my Mom and bring her back with me to get a better look but it was only a passing thought. I was too afraid something would happen to her. The next morning I had to fill in for someone so had to be back to work first thing in the morning. I was afraid to drive back by the area but it was light out by this time so I was a little more at ease. I anxiously wanted to see the objects in the light but when I drove back by the area around 5/6AM, they were gone. There was no sign of anything strange ever being there. I wish I had more info to provide. It wasn’t until years later that I realized these objects had to of somehow flown in there. I’m  not sure how that would be possible but they were so large that there’s no other way they could have gotten there, or left in such a short amount of time. I don’t remember the rest of my drive home after seeing these things. This is all I remember, unfortunately. My Mom did tell me that I woke her up when I got home and told her about what I had seen. If there’s anything you can tell me that might possibly help me to comprehend what I saw that night, I will be forever grateful.

I was done with work at 9:30 PM  and waited for my co-worker, as she was my ride home that night.  It was about 9:45 PM when we exited the building facing east.  After about 10-15 steps out I remembered what my boss said and looked up to appreciate the moon the day before it was full. When I did, my stomach immediately sank and I stopped dead in my tracks.  My immediate impression of it was that it was a missile or rocket coming straight down (this was fairly soon after 9/11 and anxiety was still high).  But as my mind began to register what my eyes were seeing, I noticed that it had no exhaust or visible emissions, no lights or sounds and it was not traveling downward but growing downward, the top portion of it remained fixed in the sky.  All I could do was raise my arm at first to motion my co! -worker to stop walking (she hadn't yet noticed).  My eyes glued to this thing I finally muster out ""what is that? What is that? Look!"" She stops walking and I now have her attention and point to the moon. ""Do you see that? What is that? Do you see this? What is that?"" There was a slight haze but it was clear out at the time and this object was solid. It casted a faint shadow from the moonlight, it was physically there in the sky. I would best describe it as a very thin black rectangle or a thick black line in plain sight in front of the full moon. It was growing downward and looked like a solid banner slowly unraveling. We were standing there in complete awe and silence, just watching it. It then stopped ""unraveling"" (still in front of the moon) and right after it did, another line or thin rectangle appeared a little below where the first object ended and did the same ""unraveling"" the first object did. All the while maintaining a stat! ionary point of origin from where it appeared. So at first it ! started to look like exclamation point (!) But the point continued to elongate downward. The objects did not move other than appearing and ""unraveling"" the entire time. The moon was well above the tree line and no power poles or clouds were even close to it. I did not see any other aircraft in the sky. As the 2nd object started to stretch past the bottom of the moon. My coworker started to become very unsettled and distraught over what we were watching and needed to get home to her family asap. She was so shaken up from it that she asked me if I could drive her car for her. I wanted to stay and watch it, as long as I could but I couldn't deny my coworkers request to drive, seeing how shook up she got.  Driving home, I tried to continue watching it the best I could but soon lost sight of it in the trees and hills on the way home. Once home I was able to get a good view of the moon again but when I did, I didn't see the objects any more. We must have watched the objects for ! about 5-10 mins before leaving the work parking lot and about 10 to 15 mins to dive myself home. I was so excited at the time over what I saw that I wrote down some notes and drew a diagram to help better describe and understand what happened once I got home. I scoured local news for days but never heard anything about it. I told my friends and family, who were skeptical and made light of it.  Some of my friends later got confirmation from my coworker of what we saw that night. But it still scares her and she doesn't like to talk about it in detail. Although some time has passed since then, I still remember this event very vividly, as I have never seen anything like it before or since. I have since stopped telling people about it out of fear of ridicule, discrediting myself and disbelief (even I am skeptical of other people's ufo stories and sightings). I've only recently came across my notes of what I witnessed that night and wanted to tell my story one more time. I do not! know what these things are but I am certain what I saw. They ! were sol id and they were there in front of the moon. They made no noise and had no lights. They sat motionless in the sky and changed its shape. I witnessed the 2nd object literally appear and grow from nothing. I am an educated person and I cannot come to a proper explanation of what it was. It really defied my logic. I know about helicopters, meteors, contrails, chemtrails and weather balloons. I am aware of various, bizarre weather phenomena. Drones have not yet been made public. I rarely drink and I don't take drugs. I was of sound mind on that night and I am of sound mind now as I write this. What I said here happened and is is 100% true.",2019-10-04T00:00:00,40.31809857142857,-78.90465428571429

At 16:00 I went outside into my back yard to locate the source of carpenter ants that have been entering our home. Having found the entry to the nest, at about 16:30 I decided to sit down on a recliner and watch the passing cloud cover. Just when I looked up (facing south) I was surprised to see a light circulating overhead. I estimate that the overhead cloud cover was about two to three thousand feet high, and of varying thickness, with occasional open areas, which made it possible to temporarily glimpse the three-quarter moon, a planet and some stars, and an airplane that flew by. The light was definitely coming from above the clouds.  I estimate the size at about thirty feet. I observed it from an angle of about forty-five degrees.  The light appeared as a glow shinning downward through the clouds.  (To verify, I looked over the backyard wall toward the horizon to see if there was any light that was shinning upwards-there was none.)  (Also, this could not have been a search helicopter, since there was no sound and a search helicopter would not be operating above the cloud cover, and the light was not shinning through the clouds with enough intensity to light up anything on the ground two to three thousand feet below.)  The light traveled, counter-clockwise, in an oval of about several hundred feet (perhaps 400-500 ft.) wide.  It took about seven seconds for the light to complete a full oval.  From my perspective, the light appeared to be moving in an oval pattern.  The light kept circling in the same location; but, it wasn't in a perfect oval; there was some slight deviation from a perfect oval pattern.  The light may have been a circle and its movement may have been a circle had I observed it directly overhead, but from my perspective it appeared oval. I watched the light for about fifteen minutes.  I awakened my wife; and we watched the light together for about fifteen minutes. There was no sound associated with the light.  At about 16:50, a much higher passing airplane (perhaps a two-engine) became intermittently visible through the thinning cloud canopy. It was clearly heard as it passed by. At 17:02 the onset of sunrise began to brighten the sky and the light faded from view, and we returned back inside of the house. I did not feel any connection with this light. I did not feel any emotions, other than calm curiosity. The following morning, at about 16:00, with the cloud conditions about the same, I looked in the same direction for about forty-five minutes, but I did not see any light as I did the morning before. And the following early Sunday, with the cloud conditions about the same, at about 15:00 and again at about 16:30, I looked in the same direction for about fifteen minutes, but I did not see any light as I did the week before.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,35.2668524137931,-106.72171655172414

I saw a UFO on way home tonight, probably between 8:45 and 9:00 pm, about 7.5 mile from West end of Tacoma Narrows Bridge westbound on 16. Absolutely not a terrestrial craft at all.  It traveled on a down slope trajectory from approximately East to West to the West of highway 16 probably heading somewhat southwest although hard for me to tell.  It had to have been seen by scores of people with the clear sky conditions and fact its boxy structure was partially illuminated since it was mostly transparent.  Its trajectory was unusual itself, a virtual path of bright globes, not a vapor trail and not tenuously shimmering but like someone took a huge number of brightly lit globes lights and clustered them in a very, very narrow cone with the wide end on opposite end from the craft and as it descended it left this trail of lighted globes which did not burn out or fade but just stayed painted in sky until it went out suddenly much later than you would instinctively expect.  You would have to see it to really believe it I am sure. ",2019-10-04T00:00:00,,

The craft shot off continuing West faster then ANYTHING I have ever seen.  My neighbor across the street was on his deck cleaning up and asked what that was. Initially I was excited because I actually thought I’d seen the International Space Station.  The following day I was speaking to another neighbor who is in the FBI and a huge Amateur Astronomer.  I told him I saw the Space station! and he stated how?  He set up his telescope that night and I again said he would not need the telescope because I saw clearly with my eyes.

It was around 6PM and the sky was completely clear, good light.  This other object was flashing, but not moving, from what we could tell.  It appeared to be circular or slightly oval, with 3 or 4 lights on the outer edges evenly spaced, again, flashing maybe once every couple of seconds (Not sure, didn’t think to time it.)  These lights were very bright, bright to the point that when they were on, the object became somewhat of a bright smear in the sky.  When they were off, you could see faintly that the shape was roughly circular.  The contrail of the plane that had just passed (going north) was still visible.  The blinking object appeared to be at around the same altitude as the contrail, although, I am no pro at determining such a thing. So, what do you do when confronted with something like this?  Well, you look for more like it of course.  We scanned the sky and didn’t see any other similar objects.  However, coming from the north going south and close to us, maybe 1000ft up we saw a moving black object.  It was an irregular shape and it seemed to change shape as it moved which made us wonder if it was some sort of deflating balloon that had been released.  However, it was moving at a pretty steady speed and there really wasn’t much wind.  I don’t know how big this thing was and will leave it at that for now because my gut tells me it was unrelated and probably some normal thing. The first object had moved east while we watched the black thing.  It had to have moved relatively far because it was noticeably smaller.  Then we noticed an object identical to this one coming in from the north, apparently moving in the direction of the first object.  By this time, it looked like the first object had stopped moving again, but I could be wrong about that.  Hard to tell from that distance/angle.  The similar object was clearly on an intersecting path and soon the two met and then from that point on you couldn’t differentiate between them and they slowly faded out. I can’t say much about the speed of the first object because we didn’t see it move to the other location.  However, the object that “caught up” with it was moving fast.  We are under a major flight path, see planes passing all the time.  The second object was moving as fast as or faster than the planes we see passing by.  In that moment I thought it was faster, possibly much faster, only because we had just seen a plane pass by and I think memory of that influenced my analysis.  But who knows, really?  At times like that you’re not exactly thinking about making accurate measurements. Of course, I did not have my phone, having left it in my office, but even if I had my phone, I doubt the pictures would have given much because of the altitude of the objects.  For the black object maybe, it would have helped because that was closer, but again, I think that was something likely to have a down to earth explanation. I shared this information with my daughters and they had nothing productive to say, so I gave up on telling anyone else until now.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,41.1448679245283,-73.34294245283019

Pikchuck and beyond, I spotted a very, very fast-rising, very brilliant flashing craft. The sun was high, aprox. at 2 PM.  During the rise, which started above the highest Olympic peak - I see all the highest peaks - I attributed the  flashes to sun reflections as the sky was lightly clouded with mostly wispy, very high cover with widely-scattered denser, small cloud groups to the East. This craft appeared at first to be on a collision trajectory with a large, twin engine Boeing, dusty blue fuselage, white wings apparently on the test range route, North, from Paine Field, at approx. 5000 Ft.  However this craft passed nearly directly above the Boeing plane, perhaps 3 - 7000 Ft higher. It continued in a straight trajectory East, rising very fast, flashing brilliant bronze, blinding white, and polished aluminum, as if a multi, flat-sided, spinning shape reflected sunlight, or its own powerful, pulsed light that apparently covered the entire structure. On an apparent constant straight climb angle, it was entering the group of denser clouds to the East over the Cascades, I estimate 60, 000 Ft+ altitude. Apperaing to pass through lower clouds, as the flashes and now very small-appearing craft disappeared-reappeared between clouds, the flashing and color continued.  At this point I was barely able to discern the craft, except the brilliant flashing continued. However high, it was still on the 35 - 45 degree climb trajectory as it became too small against the moderately blue sky to the East of the clouds it went through. It was happening so fast I didn't think to check my phone for time.  I estimate the E.T. to be aprox. 60 - 90 seconds. Served in the Navy and watching Navy Aircraft, as a speed reference, this craft was not particularly much faster than full throttle fighter planes.  However, I imagine they would be sorely taxed to catch or intercept, or reach ATA strike velocity. The most remarkable feature was the brilliant, multi metallic colored flashing that covered the entire craft every flash. As this event was a weekday and I'm retired, and I figured the very brief elapsed time and trajectory would likely preclude all, if anyone else observing this with a similar vantage,  I didn't search for any place to share my experience.  Therefore, all I recall about the date is mid-May. This morning I checked for any search record of this siting.  This site came up.

I started with trying to find out if we have UFOs working with our military, since President Trump declared the forming of our new Space Force.  My findings are that we do have craft, 10 at the present and that we have already been traveling with them for decades.  I also am seeing that the Moon does have a secret base on the far side, occupied by us, Israel and of course ETs.  Money spent by us alone, comes at around $750 billion over the course of it's existence and construction has been partnered 3 ways. 	The other facts that I've seen are that the craft have the ability to go from Earth to Moon in 15 minutes and Earth to Mars in 2 1/2 hrs. to a base that's there, too. 	The old Majestic 12 group are now a group of 32, headed by an Air Force General, Marc Jamison, also commanding the secret M.I.B. unit.  His name came to me letter by letter and afterwards all I had to do was to Google his name and below is what I was totally amazed to find.

He has led and planned national Cyber, Counter Terror and Air Operations and has advised senior-level USG leadership on strategies and policy. Colonel Jamison is a demonstrated expert in cyber strategy, planning, training, threats, operations, policy and organizations.

Last information that I sought was where these ETs have been coming from.

Good evening, After some consideration, I have decided to report an incident that occurred on the night of 12/21/2019.  I am a 737 Captain at a major US airline.  In 21 years of flying with an air carrier I have never seen something that I couldn’t explain in one way or another. This event is my first exception.  Unfortunately, my times and locations for this event are not exact. The First Officer (FO) and I were so taken with what was occurring, discussing what it might have been, that I did not note this information to the degree that I should have.  I did take a screen shot of my computer flight plan later in the flight.  Time and location have largely been rebuilt using this data and the mutual recollection of myself and the FO. We were about 2.3 hours in to our flight from JFK to SFO, cruising at 32,000 feet, Mach .79, on a magnetic course of approximately 270.  The time was about 1950 central time (0150Z) and we were roughly 50-100 nautical miles north of Kansas City.  The sky was very clear.  The cockpit overhead light was turned off, but both the FO and I had our map lights on as we ate our crew meals.  My point in describing this is to illustrate the moderate amount of light pollution within the cockpit rendering only the brighter stars visible. While eating dinner, I noticed 5 white lights in the night sky that I initially took to be stars. They were centered within a few degrees of the nose of our aircraft.  These 5 “stars” were in an exact diagonal line at approximately a 30 degree angle of tilt relative to the horizon. I would say their distance apart was about the same as the spacing in Orion’s belt. They were approximately 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon.  The lowest “star” was on the left, and the highest was on the right.  When first observed, they were all the same “medium” relative intensity to other stars.  They had zero relative motion with respect to the other stars in the area. What struck me was the linear nature of their formation.  I decided to have a look at my iPad star chart after I finished eating and continued to watch the 5 lights. After about 5 minutes, my FO commented, “Do you see those 5 stars out there?”.  The comment was unsolicited. It had struck her as peculiar too.  We agreed that we had never seen that star formation in the sky.  We put our food away, turned off our interior lights and began watching intently for the next 15 to 20 minutes.  During that time period, the light in the middle of the row of five flared twice to a very bright intensity.  I would liken it to an Iridium flare. The remaining four did not change in intensity.  Towards the end of the time period, the two pairs of lights on either side of the center light quickly faded and were no longer visible.  Approximately 10-20 seconds after the outer pairs of lights faded, the center light flared slightly and began moving diagonally up and to the right in our field of view at about a 30 degree angle.  It moved at about half of the pace normally observed when viewing the ISS. The movement lasted for less than 10 seconds before it also faded! in intensity until no longer visible.  This final light faded in a way similar to when a satellite enters the Earth’s shadow and no longer reflects light in the direction of the observer. That was the end of it. Not too flashy, and certainly no threat of ever going down in history as significant.  I just felt compelled to share the experience since it was so out of the ordinary for me. The FO and I discussed various hypotheses about the lights in the aftermath.  There is no way it was an aircraft.  The extended period of zero relative motion to the background and unwavering uniformity of the formation rules it out unequivocally.  It was not naturally occurring.  The geometry of the formation indicates something man made, or other.  My perception of the flaring indicates reflection of sunlight rather than a light bulb of some sort.  These were not objects using aerodynamics.  I believe they were in space, but did not behave like a craft in orbit unless that orbit was geosynchronous. There is probably a good explanation for this, but I have no idea what that explanation might be.  I would very much appreciate any insight you may have based on your experience.  I am hoping that perhaps you have a deeper knowledge regarding near Earth orbital operations being conducted that may explain what I saw.  I’m also hoping someone else saw it and reported the same event. Thank you for your time.",2020-01-31T00:00:00,39.100835139760406,-94.56447929264118

The object was probably flying overhead around 6:30pm or later but not after 7pm. I saw a flash of light that remained consistent for about 2 seconds then disappeared flying in 1 direction headed into some clouds and disappeared. It did not come out the other end of clouds. It was as if the craft sped up and shot some fire/light out and looked almost like it could have been a close falling star or meteor. I heard a very quiet rumble and it was almost silent. I said “What is that?” And my student then looked up and saw it too. She would not have noticed unless I said something. The reason I saw it was because I saw it out of my peripheral vision above as it shot very fast into the clouds. It came from an area of no clouds heading west and flew in a dart of light into some dark clouds and disappeared. I did not see it come out anywhere else. The entire event could not have lasted more than 2 seconds. I think I may have seen a stream of smoke or a trail out like a comet or a jet stream that only started from when I saw the flash until it went into the clouds. I was not sure if the shape was a ball or a dart shape. It may have been a military jet that was silent and doing night flying. I am not sure what it was. It was very fast and before it flash! ed it was completely silent and undetectable by sound or even sight. Like it appeared in the sky and flew fast like a comet and went into a cloud and disappeared. And yes it was way lower than any meteorite but way higher than a typical airplane flies and way faster than any commercial jet flying.

OBSERVATION:  While I was sitting in my vehicle parked in a open lot in Bullhead City, AZ at coordinates N 35°10.070' W 114°33.808' at elevation: 527 Feet per my Garmin GPS, I suddenly observed approx three (3) unknown type aerial vehicle/craft(s) moving at an intense speed, over Laughlin, NV, and appeared to be just above Laughlin area Casino(s), from my vantage point in Bullhead City, AZ, over Aquarius & Riverside Casino(s).

I attempted to immediately, retrieve my Simmons binoculars 10x42, and with my common-sense articulation and judgment followed the trajectory of the unknown 3 crafts, and was still able to observe the crafts moving via binoculars observation. as I was simultaneously observing the craft taking my eyes away for the binoculars with the naked eye I was unable to observe the craft moving in a south-southeast direction.  The totality of the observations lasted less than 20 seconds. the craft appeared to be flying at low altitude vaguely visible to the naked eye. Weather conditions are cold at 64° Fahrenheit with broken clouds that appear to be at high altitude with somewhat of a full moon in the Northeast sky opposite of where I observed such crafts traveling in the western sky of my observation.  While observing the unknown 3 type crafts, it appeared to look like a triangle, with one light in the lead and the other two further back, as if they were trailing the lead in the front.

Report It turns out that I have encountered and documented unexplained things in the sky on three separate occasions.  The most recent was enough for me to look back at a video I had taken almost three months earlier and as I was organizing the material a finger twitch led me to the recycle bin where I found a deleted folder with an object that looks very much like what I saw and documented most recently. Starting with the oldest. On July 27, 2016, at 7:11 (time stamp), I saw something unusual out at pyramid Lake NV and took two pictures.  I’m assuming I observed it only for a short time.  It wasn’t until the other day when I was organizing all the unexplained material I have that I restored the deleted pictures taken in 2016.  I had forgotten about it and as with the next sighting I didn’t think that much of it at the time.  How I found them is as bizarre as any of it. On March 31, 2019, at 1:52 PM, I took a video with my phone of an object north of my location in Sun Valley, NV.  Minutes prior to that I was out emptying garbage or something and noticed something in the sky.  It looked like a Mylar balloon that was reflecting the sun in intervals.  Not exact intervals.  I remember thinking that I live in the flight path; debris that high doesn’t seem safe. I  saw my neighbor, brought his attention to it and grabbed my phone.  As my neighbor and I watched it he was saying it was garbage and I thought yah a piece of Mylar but a 4x8 sheet because it looked too far away to be a one foot balloon.  I took several pictures not able to see it in the viewfinder just point and shoot.  With the eyes it would not be visible for moments and then you would see it flash brightly and repeatedly (possibly 2 or 3 different intervals) for a few seconds.  I don’t recall how it ended as far as, I think I got bored and went inside as opposed to it disappeared.  Probably 5 t! o 15 minutes of observation. At the time with my neighbors’ comments and opinion that it was nothing, I wasn’t personally very excited and didn’t download the pictures and video to a desktop until June 7th.  If memory serves I saw nothing on the pictures and deleted them and wasn’t excited enough to render the video in order to capture a still to zoom in on until July 1st.  I became more excited to see what the object in the video looked like when I had a third encounter with an unexplained object in the sky that I observed for probably 40 minutes.  I’ve now crawled over the video and captured quite a few stills from the March 31 video.  One still fortuitously caught a fly passing by and I also captured 5 stills (or snapshots) labeled “move sequence” showing what appears to be a second object appearing and moving away from the first object very fast as the first object disappears.  The whole event of the second object lasted less than a second! Digital zoom on the video frame doesn’t seem to be as good as wi! th photos but the object looks extremely similar to both encounters at Pyramid despite the fact that to the eye in March it looked defined shining and strobing.  In June of this year and July of 2016 (at Pyramid Lake) the object to the eye looked like a small roundish white cloud. June was wispy and undefined but you could see it all the time, it didn’t move and it looked a different color temperature than the surrounding clouds. Tuesday June 25th 2019 I drove out to Pyramid Lake NV for a swim.  I purchased a day use pass at 4:23 PM and took the (I think 15 minute) drive to Wino beach.  I don’t recall how long I observed the strange object I saw in the sky before I took the first picture at 5:22.  The object I saw to the East of my location looked like a very small cloud but it was a significantly whiter color.  What really made me take notice was that it was not moving with the surrounding clouds. I took 27 pictures and one video never seeing it in the viewfinder over the course of about 17 minutes.  I believe I may have not seen it for a little while, while there was a dense cloud where it was.  I probably “paid attention” to the object for 40 minutes.  I think I left the beach around 7:00 and recall looking for it, not seeing it and seeing several condensation trails.  I recalled not seeing any sign of aircraft the entire time I was observing the object.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,,

As I was watching the road ahead, something caught my eye and caused me to look up at the clouds ahead of me.  That is when I saw a huge craft emerge from a large cloud.  The craft was gray and seemed to reflect the clouds around it, almost as a camouflage. There seemed to be 4 large “bays” or “windows” vertically from top to bottom of the craft From my perspective, the craft was trapezoid shape with the top and bottom parallel and the leading edge tapered.  It was larger at the top and tapered down.  I did not see the trailing edge as a second craft emerged and obstructed the trailing end of the first craft.  The trailing end of the second craft remained obstructed by the cloud, I assume it looked similar to the tapered leading edge.

We believe now that we definitely saw something that was not normal. ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary time.  PD))",2019-10-04T00:00:00,40.2494,-85.6708

I looked up and could see out the window what I thought was an airplane.  It struck me though that it was moving very slowly, I’m guessing 100mph.   It was silver, and cigar shaped and horizontal, no windows.  I noticed that I couldn’t see the wings, and thought it was perpendicular to my line of sight, then also noticed it had no tail.  Then it dawned on me and I said, “what the “+*@$” is that?”  As it registered in my brain that it was something odd, the cigar object moved behind a tree on my property, (blocking my view) and I quickly got up and went outside to see it without being hidden behind the tree.  It was gone.  I thought that was really strange since if it was some kind of drone, or if it was a plane that turned, I would see it falling or turning.  It was gone in a matter of about 5 seconds it took me to move away f! rom the tree that blocked my line of sight. I went in the house to get my camera and yelled to my wife to come out.  I have a cannon camera and figured I would take a video in case it came back, and aimed at approximately where I thought the object should be.    I took about two 30 second videos and saw nothing. Later that week I watched the videos on my computer several times.  All I have is just the standard window type programs.  I saw a quick  movement on one of the videos which I would guess is about a 10th of a second.  I eventually got a snapshot of the video.  Using again just the standard windows programs, with the various filters it looked like there were four brief lights on the sides of the object.  Very poor quality since I had to zoom in.  The object was now canted at a vertical angle.  Maybe it was a bug… I really am not sure. Also, it never occurred to me at the time that the object made no sound.  I would estimate that the object was about 3,000 feet in elevation and may have been within a mile or so of the Park Rapids airport which is South of my location.   We have small planes, smaller jets, and corporate planes that use this airport as well as helicopters that fly nearby. Also strange, and maybe this is not connected to staring at the sky where the object was… but I noticed  something odd in my vision after this incident.   I see the outline of an open at the top and bottom an Octagon.   I would call it an “open octagon.”  I see it with both eyes, it isn’t floaters and I never noticed  this problem before.   It has been two months and I still see this problem in my vision.  I asked my wife if she saw this and she said she saw something like, “half of the octagon,” at the time.  She doesn’t see that anymore.   I see this open octagon when I look at something like blue sky, and it is only visible as I look from one spot to another for a brief moment and then it is gone.  I looked up Palinopsia but that isn’t exactly the same. I am a 70 year old military veteran.",2019-10-04T00:00:00,46.9967,-95.0898

The location was perfect with very little light pollution along with clear skies.  At approximately 1:30 am I thought I saw what would have been the brightest shooting star I have ever seen entering Earth’s atmosphere, originating from the southwest on a bearing of 045 and 30 degrees above the horizon.  The object continued to get brighter and just as I was expecting it to flame out the speed immediately slowed to that of a commercial jetliner and the brightness of a normal star.  It continued along a straight line for 5-6 seconds before instantly accelerating to full speed and previous brightness as it left Earth’s atmosphere.  To be clear, the object flew in the same path and was visible for approximately 7 seconds in its entirety. I am a former pilot who from The Ohio State University flight school.

To provide background, to the north of my apartment is a major thoroughfare of Aircraft flying West toward DFW Airport and Love Field in Dallas, TX.  I often smoke outside in the evenings and have seen all types of crafts, usually easily determining that they are Commercial Aircraft.  On THIS occasion, the light was different. First, the light was White and moved about half-way across the entire horizon from East to West.  It moved at a MUCH higher rate of speed than any plane.  There were planes in the distance to compare to.  Suddenly, it Stopped.  No slowing, as if a plane was turning… it just Stopped.  It proceeded to move directly Upward at a high rate of speed, and then back Downward at a slower rate.  This is definitely not any maneuver that can be performed by modern aircraft.  It was also quite a distance away.  My guess would be 10+ Miles North of me, possibly near McKinney, TX, but it is hard to determine . The light was Solid White to begin with, then began to flash, and then turned a solid Red.  The flashing was Extremely Bright for something that far away. I ran inside to get my Cell Phone to record the light.  When I came back out, the light was still there, and came above the horizon (so, it couldn’t be a drone… too far away.)  It continued to flash and then moved directly Upward.  It then moved to the East toward an Airplane that was flying East to West.  It seemed to mirror the speed of the plane, but was lower on the horizon.  Again it stopped.  The color changed to a Red from White, and it dimmed by a large amount.  The Light then became bright again and moved back to the West.  I continued to watch the light until it went below the Horizon. I see planes flying in this sky on a DAILY basis… and always keep an eye out for anything weird… this is the FIRST TIME I have ever seen anything like this.  I don’t know WHAT is was, but the movements were not something I had ever witnessed, nor do I believe that the maneuvers could have been completed by any craft with our technology. I DID video what I could, but my footage is grainy, and I’m not a good Camera-Man.  I do narrate what I am seeing.

I would guess above Willow Creek.  I at first thought it was a snowmobile on the ridge but I then seen it was above the mountain.  Very bright light.  Then all these star looking objects came from it in a perfect straight line heading east overhead. Way way up there.  They looked like stars but all were moving in a perfect line. When they got right above (straight up) they disappeared.  They kept coming and coming...probably 30 to 50 of them.  Then the light just disappeared from the western horizon and they quit coming.  After the last one was gone I started to see a few returning but going slower and heading more SSW than where the bright light was at. Almost like they were returning from a mission.  My thought are that I seen a mother ship of some sort and it sent out a bunch of smaller cra fts.  A few airplanes went by while I was watching these UFO's and the planes were wa! y below them.  I kid you not they looked like stars except they were is a perfect straight line moving east and very evenly spaced apart.  This whole episode lasted about 25 to 30 minutes.

I was astounded and asked my brother, “What was that?!”  He didn’t know.   So, I drove up the hill a little bit farther and turned into the Moshannon Valley Regional Business Center.  I went to the back of the parking lot where it was a little darker, and we could see the entire vista of the valley facing west and northwest.  We had lost sight of the kite-shaped formation,  but we were amazed as one bright orange ball of light after another appeared out of the setting sun, came due east straight toward our car, banked to the left and rose simultaneously to another altitude.  As they did this, one after another, their lights went completely out and they disappeared.  I did happen to catch the silhouette of one after it went “lights out”, and it was shaped sort of like a big, thick war plane with wings back like a jet.  But, these were not planes – there were no flashing lights like planes have (they were just bright balls of orange lights – almost like someone setting off fireworks that flew horizontally through the air – and then they each banked to the left, rose up and went black). I noticed that someone else reported the exact same thing on 07/17/19 in Altoona, PA, which is about 45 miles southwest of State College, PA where we live.  Here is the experience that they reported:  Bright orange big light quiet, appeared to the south moved across the sky & got dimmer then dissipated, repeated 5 times over 1/2 hour. I saw an orange light pretty bright & big sort of just appeared at a point south of my house moved across the sky towards the north, after a couple minutes kept getting less bright then sort of dissipated, no sound at all.

I looked up and saw a very large rectangle moving very fast approximately North to South over Sacramento and it continued its course until I could no longer see it in the distance (was still heading South). It crossed almost directly over my head at what seemed to be above a normal airplane altitude but spanned the distance of the entire sky in approximately 8 seconds from the time I first saw it.  I don’t know how fast that is but it made the F-22 Raptor I’ve seen near Fresno seem sluggish, cumbersome, and awkward flying in comparison.

I had just backed our car into our parking spot. Although it was a crystal clear night, there was a lot of light pollution and only a few bright stars were visible. My husband got out of the car to walk to the mailboxes. I took the moment to look up at the sky and appreciate the view from our convertible before closing the roof. While looking up westward at the sky, I saw a very bright white ‘star’ move across the sky SE to S (about 5-6”) in my peripheral vision. There were no other visible stars in its vicinity, nor were there any aircraft. I slowly got out of the car without taking my eyes off the ‘star’ and turned to look up at it directly in its very high south position. It continued to move in random directions, not varying much between 160 degrees S and 150 degrees SE . I called for my husband to come over quickly, I pointed out the ‘star’ and asked him if he could see it moving, too. He said yes, and we stood watching the star dart around for about five minutes. Then we laid down on the sidewalk to stabilize ourselves to be sure it was the ‘star’ that was moving and not our bodies. We continued to watch it dart around for another 10 minutes or so. Although it did not waiver in its brightness until it seemed to move away, my husband also observed periodic white lights to the sides of the star. I did not see this detail. We didn’t try to take any photos or videos because we only had our iPhones with us. The movement seemed to start to slow down and the star seemed to move out further at 154 SE degrees towards the Aquila constellation. We got up and walked to our house and encountered our neighbors. We pointed out the moving star and they could both see it and its movements but it was getting harder for any of us to make it out. At 11:21 pm we went inside as the star was now too far away to discern from the light pollution. This morning, a knowledgeable friend did a quick check on a satellite tracking app for the evening of the 26th and the brightest thing during the time frame I cited was an ISS pass (a very bright magnitude -1.1), but that was at the opposite side of the sky and skirting the northern horizon from our area's vantage point.
