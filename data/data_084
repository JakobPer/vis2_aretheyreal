Tabor in Portland, OR I witnessed a light in the sky located South/Southeast approximately between Mt. Tabor and Mt. Scott just below the scattered cloud layer that behaved like nothing I have ever witnessed in the sky before.  I was outside of the house preparing to move my car into the driveway from the street where it was parked.  As I was getting into my car I was now facing south, and before sitting down into the car I noticed a bright, amber, shimmering light in the sky comparable in size and intensity to a street light viewed at 1-2 blocks away.  What drew my attention is that the light was so bright and at this point it was stationary in the sky.  To be clear, there is frequent air traffic over Mt Tabor depending upon flight arrival patterns at Portland International Airport (PDX), so we are very accustomed to witnessing bright jet landing lights and how they appear/behave in the night sky.  Wh! at I was now observing was definitely not any form of conventional aircraft, and was definitely not jet landing or helicopter lights.  Approximately 3 seconds after I began observing the light it very smoothly and rapidly moved from south to north in a straight line toward me covering approximately an eighth of a mile in the sky, though the distances are hard to gauge with the clouds as my only reference point in the sky.  There was no jet noise or any other sound.  The light stopped and hovered stationary again, very bright and clearly visible.  At this point I called my family members that were still in our house via my cell phone from the street to come out and look at this light, because I did not want to lose sight of it.  The light continued to hover for approximately 1-2 minutes with clouds blowing by above the light while the light remained stationary.  By now I had one witness with me observing the light.  Now, the light moved again in the same manner to the east b! y another approximate eighth to one quarter of a mile where it! stopped again, and remained stationary in the sky.  A third witness had now arrived.  We observed the light for another 30 seconds to 1 minute as it hovered stationary in the sky with clouds blowing around it as it sat in a small patch of open sky.  The light must have gained altitude during it’s last movement, because at the end of this period the clouds began to then move in front of the light, became thicker causing the light to fade behind them.  From this point the cloud cover thickened in this area of the sky.  Three of us watched the sky for another 15 minutes but never saw the light again.  I don’t think air traffic control at PDX was routing planes over southeast Portland last night during this event because I did not see or hear any jets while observing this light.",2012-05-29T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

At approximately 7:40 am I was sitting in my hot tub facing south-west.  At first I saw one white light traveling way slower than an airplane and even slower than a satellite.  I thought maybe someone had let a balloon loose but it was so high I thought it was doubtful.  I am pretty sure the altitude was twice as high as an airplane flies, so maybe 60,000 feet?  I am a private pilot so I have a little bit of experience with judging altitude, but it is hard to say because of not really knowing what I was looking at. After about 10 seconds I noticed a second and then third light that formed a perfect triangle.  The front light was white and the side lights were red, not solid red, but reddish.  After a few more seconds I saw the fourth and final light.  It was white and trailed the front white light by 3 to 4 times the distance from the front light to either of the red lights.  So what I saw was a perfect triangle of white in front and red on both side and then the trailing light. Why I am intrigued with what I saw is because of the perfect geometry of the shape.  The lights were traveling from south west to north east.  As it turns out I had a perfect view from my hot tub.  The lights travelled directly above my head.  I think it took between 10 and 12 minutes from about 30 degrees from horizon to about 120 degrees of horizon.  I am not sure if that is how you describe it but I am thinking 180 degrees spectrum.

I am a college student in Sarasota, Florida. I saw a ufo, similar to some of the other ones witnessed in other parts of Florida reported on this site: http://www.ufosnw.com/sighting_reports/2011/westpalmbeachfl07272011/westpalmbeachfl07272011.htm  It was a greenish orb.  I am an art student, and I made an animation that closely resembles what I saw. I believe I replicated what I saw with about 85% accuracy. I saw it clearly, and remember it clearly, but it occurred no more than 3 seconds, so that's why I believe it to be about 85% accurate.  Anyways, here's what happened: Last Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, around 3 am, I was driving from school to my apartment. I was wide awake. The road was dark-there are no road lamps. Up far ahead are plazas that have lighting but it was a mile ahead. As I drove, a bright light caught my attention; I could see it to the right through my windshield. It was circular and orb-like, and it was a bright light. Most of it was neon green, with a bright white center, but I could see cyan blue towards the bottom right of the light. The orb descended towards the ground in a smooth curved path. It descended rather fast, but not fast enough that it appeared to be falling. It had no tail like a falling meteorite, and it made no noise. It was consistently orb-like. Eventually, it was obscured by tall dark trees.  I tried to figure out what it was. At first I thought that it might of been some sort of creature/bird/insect that was close to a light and reflected bright light. However, there are no lights or road lamps around the area. Wherever the orb descended to it was in wild pine forestry. Second, I thought that perhaps a light from a car or some nearby building reflected on my windshield; but after observing my windshield for days, I could see that my windshield does not reflect any light-only car door windows reflect light. The orb was way too bright and crystal clear to be a reflection either way. I also thought of it possibly being a meteor, but it has no tail-years before I had witnessed a rather large bright blue and loud meteor burn in the sky and they are not identical at all. It could not have been a helicopter because the light was extremely neon green and slightly blue at the bottom, and it was too large to be a helicopter; I would've heard it if it was that close. It wa! s also moving too fast to be any man-made craft. In conclusion, it's nothing I've seen and nothing I can explain.  As an illustration student, I just HAD to replicate what I saw. I made an animation to show the speed and path of the orb, the colors and brightness as accurate as I remember, and how high it was and how far away it was. I hope my illustrations will help in whatever investigations or studies your organization does. If you have further questions, feel free to email me. I'll be sending the graphics as soon as I submit this form.",2012-04-18T00:00:00,27.310734441087614,-82.49044025679758

The first incident was on 6/10 at approximately 3:30AM. I witnesses two distant white ""stars"" moving SE in the sky on paths where it appeared they could meet.  After about 15 seconds, they appeared to almost meet.  One turned very bright white as it stopped for a couple seconds and headed directly N across the entire sky in approximately 30 seconds before disappearing in to the horizon.  There were no erratic flight paths observed, just a short stop and a 90 degree change in flight.  The other ""star"" maintained its path and was also lost in to the horizon.

This was a very distant ""star"" that flew S to N and either stopped or disappear directly S of the big dipper.  I did not see it continue past that area in the sky.  I maintained observation of the area, and approximately 5 minutes later witnessed the ""star"" reappear from the same area and cross the sky heading N in a matter of seconds. I have seen this on other nights and witnessed identified aircraft (shape,sound, tracking lights) flying toward or away from the Quad City Airport at a low altitude as a  ""star"" flew far far above, but in a similar relative direction. These ""stars"" are so distant that they can likely be observed in other states.  Just scale the sky facing W where the big dipper is to your right, observe S, and you will be able to see this for yourself!  Some times, I have seen movement within seconds of being outside!

Okay, so I decided to tell this story because its the only UFO type of thing I have ever seen, and seems substantially different then most sightings.  It started off as a mid summer day in the month of June id say in 2008-2009.  I was sleeping over a friends house and the next morning we were going to center city Philadelphia to go skate.  I live about 40 miles from Philly in Doylestown, so we would usually take the train.  But, the night before we had gone I was to be sleeping in his basement (he had a rancher house so there was no upstairs, only first floor and basement) while he was in his bed upstairs.  It was a boring night just watching tv on his pull out couch, I was alone because my friend was talking to his mom in his room. I was swiftly greeted by my friends weiner dog Barney.  He then darted over to the wide open screen door (Basement had a door which lead to a patio) .  A little odd I thought at first considering he wasn't much of a guard dog and usuall! y wouldn't just start tearing ass around the house just to look out a window.   So as I'm sitting there just watching tv when the dog starts barking. I was curious so I decided to see what was going on. I do a quick visual sweep of the patio, and saw nothing.  But then, I looked up and shit got full on crazy. I saw this MASSIVE huge glowing ball of blue, it was a really deep cool looking color.  It rose from behind the tree line in the distance and was dead silent. It cut left quickly for a little bit, then veered back and up then shot off quicker than anything I have ever seen before. I instantly freaked out and ran upstairs.  I started yelling if anybody saw what I just did and my friend and his Mom just replied ""no.""  I tried to debunk what I saw but it wasn't any holiday with fireworks, the airport was across the other side of town, and not to mention that a bright blue orb of glowing light doesn't really remind of a plane.  No explanation was ever found, still confu! sed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2012-06-08T00:00:00,40.32416086956521,-75.12223043478261

I was out walking up and down our quarter mile long driveway listening to music in order to hopefully get tired enough to sleep.  The time was around 3am (about an hour ago) and I looked up to see a bright light moving through the sky.  It was slightly bigger than the stars, so I assumed it was a plane, but it was extremely bright and I've never seen a plane that bright before.  I stopped and kept my eyes on it thinking it was perhaps a shooting star, but it wasn't moving fast enough.  After about 10 seconds of watching it, the light started to dim slowly, until it was more dim than all of the stars.  The object, which was a round ball of white light, appeared to break formation, or separate into 2 separate red/orange balls of light which began moving in a circle. They circled each other 1 time, and then disappeared straight up. I would be lying if I said that I weren't slightly shaken by witnessing this.

Very near KCI so I've been a plane observer for some time and I feel safe stating this was very different.  Also it was not following any of the 4 ""airlanes"" of aircraft approaching KCI in my area.  Not a shooting star unless it was one about to hit earth.  Not a satellite, nearer Earth than that.

About 5 hours ago I was in La Mirada, California.  I saw a solid white light traveling west to east; south of La Mirada.  I saw this light between 8:05 and 8:07pm on Easter Sunday, 8 April 2012.  This light was not directly overhead; but if directly overhead is 180 degrees and the horizon is 90 degrees, then this light was traveling at about 150 degrees; again, west to east.  The light was about the same size as a normal jet or plane white light at a low altitude.  By the way, this area in the sky has frequent planes and jets and the vast majority of them are flying low, just like the light I saw.  It is very easy to see the flashing red and green lights on EVERY jet and plane flying by La Mirada; but this light that I saw tonight, did not have any flashing red or green wing lights and it was low enough so I should have seen at least one of the flashing lights if it had any.  (I was looking south, the heavily flown flight pattern to Los Angeles airport is in the north skies from La Mirada----and at any one moment, you can see 3 to 6 jets lined-up heading towards the Los Angeles airport.)  I watched this light travel for at least 1 minute.   I first saw it first in the southwest night sky and then it disappeared as I was looking it in the southeastern sky.  It was still close when it disappeared, and it did not disappear because it was too far away for me to see it.  The white light just faded off.  Again, never did I see a single flashing red or green wing light like every other jet or plane that close in the night sky.  This light seemed very unusual whole time I watched it; but if that is all I saw, I would not have filled out this form.  During the last 3 or 4 seconds the white light turned red.  The size of the light did not change.  The size was still the same size the white light had been; but now it was red.  And it was not a solid red.  It was like 50 percent transparent and not uniformly red.  Then, after the 3 or 4 seconds of being red; it completely disappeared or faded-out.  (I am sure I was not seeing a plane turning off the white light and now I was seeing the red wing light.)  The red light looked like the same size as the solid white light I had seen; but now it had turned a 50 percent transparent red light and then just faded-out.  After it faded out, I could see other planes and jets way past this light in the distance.  I could see their white light and their flashing red and green lights.  Again, I do not think the light went out because it was too far away to see.   The light just turned red, a 50 percent transparent red, and then just faded out.  I watched for 15 minutes to see if the light re-appeared or anything else, but I did not see it re-appear.   I consciously watched and all the planes and jets north of south of me during that 15 minutes.  They all had flashing red and green wing lights along with their large white light.  I do not think the light I saw tonight was a plane or jet.",2012-04-18T00:00:00,33.90197022900763,-118.00775343511451

We were camping at Beacon Rock State Park in the Washington Columbia Gorge when we saw fireball appearing spheres moving across the sky at about the level that a small plane would fly. Initially there were five of the fireballs in a formation. I believe there were a row of three and then a row of two. After that there were about a dozen more orange spheres in single file spaced far apart moving west to east. We kept thinking that the display was over and then another fireball would pop into view from the western sky. They were quite bright and moving faster than a small plane would.  They were gaining elevation at a low angle. They would eventually disappear. It is unclear whether they entered the cloudbank and were just no longer visible or perhaps burned out.,2012-06-08T00:00:00,,

We were watching t.v. and had decided to go out on my porch to smoke a cigarette.  We sat on the step, I lit my cigarette, and looked upwards.  I saw what looked to be either a very bright white star or a planet.  The center was very bright and there was also a kind of halo of light surrounding it in the shape of a circle.  After watching for maybe one second I realized that it was moving towards my left (north).  My boyfriend had his eyes on the light as well.   He didn't have his glasses on so he couldn't see it as well as I could but he COULD tell that it was moving.  I thought it may have been a plane as I continued to watch it since I live relatively close to the Richmond Airport as well as the Hanover County Airport, but tried and failed to find the usual flashing red and blue lights or at least hear the engine. Suddenly, the object stopped moving and the circular halo of light around the object seemed to become squished into more of an oval.  It quickly decreased in sized and seemed to be moving up and diagonally away from where I sat at maybe a 130 degree angle to make a rough estimation.  It went from a substantial and easily visible orb of light to the size of a pinhole in an unreasonably rapid rate and disappeared into the sky. Like I said, my boyfriend did not have his glasses on at the moment but he could tell that the light that he'd just seen had quickly disappeared.  From my awestruck reaction he could tell that I was somewhat uneasy but all in all, I was amazed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I told my family to go outside with me to see it, and I was able to get one really good picture.  It was strange because the lights would sometimes stop, and appeared like massive stars but then continued to move.  We knew they weren't airplanes because they weren't flashing the normal red or blue lights. Once they began to move further South, it seems as if they were disappearing into the sky and becoming stars.  You could still see them twinkle, but in groups they began to go further away.

The red light started to dim and then slowly faded completely.We could still see the darkness of the craft,i threw open the window and could hear no motor or any type of small engine sounds coming from that area in the sky.It then slowly moved out of my line of sight and disappeared.I then ran downstairs and outside the backdoor,down on the lawn so we could! see better.  It was around 5 minutes standing outside waiting when almost ready to go inside because of biting misquitoes when another red light very similar to the first light appeared in the same area as when i saw the first one. This object looked brighter and moved very similar but the light stayed consistant this rime never fading,it was almost cigar shaped like a torch but then became smaller and more cylyndrical like a circle.We watched until it slowly and methodically disappeared westward towards the horizon.It was less than 5 minutes again when appeared in the same vacinity as the first two,a massive bright torchlike shaped cigar which was 10 times brighter than the first two.Following very close near that location was an immense bright ""white"" light from a mid-sized what appeared to be a military plane headed towards my direction,toward the military base-Offutt/Space-Strat Com. Bellevue,Nebraska.The red object then floated slowly and traveled in a similar ! pattern as the first two,it traveled this slow pattern again h! eading w estward toward the horizon.These lights seemed to be individual separate lights.Never blinking or flashing just the first mentioned which faded then re-appeared.I think it was probably a military test craft or drone,just my opinion but I wanted to make sure i wrote this report as quickly as I saw it asap.Thank you.",2012-05-29T00:00:00,41.254851796008865,-96.06482784922395

They appeared to be between 150 and 200 feet above ground.  They were in a straight line formation laterally, 4 across. There were absolutely no blinking lights and there were no discernable shapes that we could see surrounding the lights. 	As we moved South, the objects were moving North/East and they were passing us on our left side. My husband pulled over and I got out of the truck to better observe them. He remained in the truck and rolled down his window. 	As I got out and stood beside our truck I observed the 4 objects hovering on the other side of the highway. There was absolutely no noise coming from them. Even out of the truck I could not hear anything coming from the objects. They remained at the same altitude of about 150 to 200 feet above ground, although now they were a little further away (North East of where we were). At that point they broke formation, so that they were no longer in a straight lateral line. Some were higher and others were lower. Then 1 by 1 they blinked out of existence. They were gone. 	It all happened rather quickly, but 45 seconds was long enough to make those observations. It was very fascinating and at no point felt threatened or scared.

The light was extremely bright and moved at a high rate of speed.  What got my attention was that there was no sound and there were absolutely no flashing lights of any kind. I called for my fiance to come and see, she also noted that there were no flashing lights and that it just did not move like a plane because of the high rate of steady speed. As it moved from the south east it increased its brightness by 50% then made a very sharp turn towards due east at about a 60' to 70' degree angle then as its brightness decreased we could see 2 smaller objects, 1 ejected from each side of the object, 1 going north and 1 going south at the exact same speed.

When he then transferred the photos from camera to computer, he noticed that camera captured something in the sky that he did not notice when taking the photos. On two of the photographs this “thing” looks like a “falling star”. On other two photographs (taken after the first ones) the object seems to be closer, its shape is unclear, probably the object itself is not visible, but it has a bright blue “tale” of conic form, reminding exhaust flame of a missile""  When I examined the full-size photos, I discovered that there is a second object in the upper middle part of the photos – its blue “tail” is visible. The orientation of the two are different. Then, near the first (bright) object, a small blue stripe may be distinguished (marked by an arrow on enlarged fragments of the photos), indicating that probably there is a third object farther away. The pictures have been taken with 1-2 minutes intervals between them. The exact times are: 21:29, 21:30, 21:31, 21:33, 21:34, 21:34, 21:35, 21:37, Yerevan time (UTC/GMT +4 hours). The photos are taken with long exposition time (10 s for the first two shots and 5 s for the rest), without a tripod (that is why some of them are quite blurred). The camera is Panasonic Lumix DMC-Z50. I have made some processing of the enlarged fragment with the second (farther) object (Curve adjustment in Photoshop) to make the object more distinguishable. However, if you look at the screen in a dark room, the object is visible without any adjustment on a full-size photo (this is how I discovered it). You can see some yellow-white bright spots that are above the city, but these are of no interest - there is a high mountain behind the city (mount Ararat), and these are the lights of settlements on the mountain.  Another thing which is very important, is that when my son was staking the photos of the city, he did not notice the objects. He noticed the objects only when he was looking at the photos afterwards. Either he was too busy with making the photographs of buildings, or... the objects were hardly visible for a human eye! (not so bright to catch the attention). The second assumption is supported also by the fact that there were many people at the spot, who also did not notice the objects. Initially this seemed very strange to me, but then I made some search and found, that modern digital cameras are sensitive to UV light, and they catch it as blue (this is the case also with Lumix DMC-Z50 - that is why it is recommended to use a UV-filter when shooting outdoors in sunny weather, otherwise the images will have blue haze). So, from all these I assume, that the blue ""tails"" of the objects we see on the photos were indeed in UV range, and were invisible, or almost invisibl! e, for humans. It is the camera properties, perhaps, together with long exposition time and high intensity of UV radiation from the objects, that made it possible to see the blue ""tails"" on the photos. Later on I found another UFO report that supports this assumption: http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88222.html (a blue moving spot appeared on the photos of the sky but was not visible to photographer). And, since the objects were not observed ""in real time"", we, unfortunately, cannot say anything about their trajectory, when and where from exactly they appeared (though this can be guessed from the first photos, where the object is smaller and(?) farther), and when and, most importantly, how they disappeared.  If there would be only one object, then I would probably be sure that this is a kind of rocket or missile or jet plane, but, in my opinion, the fact that there are more than one objects (with different orientations) makes this unlikely.  For the same reason (the presence of the second object), it is, in my opinion, unlikely that this is a kind ""light reflection"" (from what and how?), as many people told me.  Next, the presence of air wave (I am not sure that ""air wave"" is the correct term though) in front of the object (if we assume that the blue part is the ""tail""), which is visible probably because of heating (or ionization?) of the air, suggests that the object moves in the atmosphere with high speed.  But, from the other hand, we see it almost in the same position in the sky on the two photos taken approximately at one minute interval.  This can be, in my opinion, if the object is very far from the observer.  And hence, it (they) should be huge i! n size.  ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flares, we believe.  PD))",2012-06-14T00:00:00,,

However, there was other vehicular traffic that witnessed this event.

I could not determine whether or not the lights belonged to an aircraft because the lights were very bright, which dazzled my eyes.

It looked like it was the size of Venus when it was viewable in May 2012,  But it was too low in the sky to be Venus.

Sometimes it would flash a bright white light.  It just hovered in the sky motionless.  After walking three blocks west on Douglas which took about 10 minutes in a casual walk, I had noticed a bright red light, a much smaller light, had flew from the south and flew in an arch over the orange and red light and I had lost track of it.  After that happened about 15 minutes later I saw two red lights flying side by side heading east.  I could hear a helicopter flying around behind me but I could not see it.  I saw the red lights that flew together as they passed over my head.  They did not blink or flash they were at a constant glow.  The red was like the color of crimson. I looked back at the red orange light in the sky still motionless.  I watched it for about 15 more minutes and there was no movement, I could still hear helicopters, but they were not close to the object as I could tell.  I walked back to my apartment, which took about 10 minutes and went to the roof of my building. There are eleven floors on my building and I went to the roof, which opens at 5am.  I went to the roof to see if I could still see this light.  It was still there.  From higher up I could see that it was far too low in the sky to be celestial.  The sun was starting to come up and it was harder to see but it was still there.

Approx a week ago, after midnight, my husband was woken up by a tapping sound on his bedroom window but did not pay any attention and continued to sleep.  He woke up the next morning and did not forget that ackward tapping on the window.  At night he'd see through his peripheral vision things that flashed by but would not relate to as being important.  At 3:00AM the tapping and the scratching on the window awoke him, he had his smartphone under the pillow and slowly focused and snap the picture of what appeared to be a ""metal looking alien"" with 6-8 metal antennas.  As he snapped the picture before he ran out of the bedroom he noticed that it was backing away. My husband never returned to that bedroom instead he went to the bathroom and observe the picture that he had taken.  He became very nervous and did not go back to sleep.   We have a very clear picture and I've called and spoken to Mr. Davenport Director of UFO Center and will send the email with the linked picture taken ~ 2 feet away from the window.  He is extremely concerned for his safety.  I'm requesting a returned email @ ((e-address deleted)) at someone's earliest convenience.  Thanking you in advance for your attention to this matter.

The pulsation from brightest to dimmest did not seem to have an particular pattern.   Some would pulsate once per 3 seconds and others would seem to stay bright, making them all seem to have their own brightness at any given time.  This could be due to cloud obscuration, but the sky was clear, for the most part, in the direction I was looking.  The lights appeared to gain in elevation, as well.   Then the lights began ""winking out"" a few at a time, and before I was able to get my video camera going, there were only three left, and they quickly disappeared.  I managed to capture the three remaining lights on my video camera, just before they disappeared...about 30 seconds of footage. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Please see video posted to the NUFORC homepage, taken by witness.  We express our gratitude to the witness for sharing the video.  ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport,   I did some research on the wind data for the time period of my sighting.  I checked several stations in the general area and they all reported minimal wind (between 0 and 4 mph), all in an easterly direction, during that time period.  Most of the graphs looked like the image I've attached, named ""winds_06_05_2012.jpg"".  The jet stream image I've attached also indicates this easterly direction.  I've attached the closest data point to the hour in which I reported the sighting (adjusted for UTC timezone).  However, the data for the hours before and after showed pretty much the same thing: the wind was minimal (between 0 and 60 knots), going in the same easterly direction.   From the video, you can tell there was not much wind where I was standing.  I am pretty sure the direction in which my camera was pointing was almost due south (I will validate this with a compass, as soon as I find one).  From the video, using the tree top as a static reference, you can see the lights moving to my right.  This would indicate the lights were moving, at least to some degree, to the west (against the direction of the wind).  I hope this helps.

The shape looked like an elongated sphere with three very faint and small lights on top lining up as if it was the tail of the aircraft or an antenna of some sort. There was no real sense of how fast it was really going and how far above from the ground it was traveling. There were also two or maybe three other lights that stood out from the rest of the stars.

I had observed the object as I entered the south side of Pidcoke a few minutes earlier.   At that point, I thought it was just an airplane.  All I could see was a white light to the left side of the highway.  I noticed the object move to the right side of the highway.   As I barely passed the north side of Pidcoke, I saw the object much more clearly.  It moved back to the left side of the highway in a zig-zag motion.   At this time, I realized this was not an airplane.  It was a triangle-shaped craft with three very bright white lights underneath the craft.  The lights were so bright, that I could clearly make out the triangle shape of the craft.   The craft was either moving very slow or virtually stationary in the air.  It was flying at a relatively low elevation.  The craft also had some sort of beam or scanning l! ight in the front of it that was moving back and forth in a horizontal motion at about a 45 degree angle from the craft.   As I passed the craft, I looked back and it disappeared.  Pidcoke is a small town in between Copperas Cove and Gatesville.",2012-06-08T00:00:00,,

Early this morning I was on my way to work in Buffalo Missouri, a construction job, headed south from Springfield, MO.  The sun had already come up. I could see the horizon of Buffalo and noticed a very dark, odd looking, little rain cloud hovering low above the city, directly above the shortest of the cities three water towers and as high as the tallest.  The cloud was as wide as the town, which has a population of a little over 3,000 people.  It had been storming during the night but this strange cloud was the only one left.   Suddenly I watched as at least two (possibly a third on the far side) gigantic triangular shaped craft emerged from the north side (toward me) but pointing west.  The front one was about twice as big as the rear object. Both were the biggest aircraft i've ever seen, including a few stealth bombers.  They were black in color however the rear one never fully emerged and I never got a clear view of the bottom.  However I could tell that they we! re both pulsating a light from their centers.  The cloud seemed to cloak them both and the light strobed in the color of the very dark, almost black cloud, back to nothing, to dark cloud.  The light emitted looked like a tractor beam from a movie for a better visual reference.  The two crafts seemed to actually be one craft possibly as they were connected in the middle by what looked like piping.  Both seemed and covered in athe haze.  The cloud acted in the most unnatural way, wrapping around the craft as if it was pulling it back in, or the craft was pulling the cloud around it.   I honestly didn't believe what i was seeing and looked down.  When I looked up it was still there, so I pulled over to find my phone that was in the back to try to take a video.  When I finally found it the entire slow moving cloud, not just the craft,  was gone.  I only saw it for at most 45 seconds, the entire incident only lasting 2 minutes. And thats the end of it. I will be emailing an illustration a! nd a map within the next day or so.   Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke by telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.

The object was round and red in color and appeared to be at a fast rate of speed over the Gulf of Mexico heading north to south before disappearing behind cloud cover (cloud cover was observed, it did not vanish).  The object flew relatively straight and then veered upward slightly before entering the clouds and could no longer be seen. The second object appeared on what seemed to be the same course and looked the exact same as the first.  This object appeared approximately 3 minutes after the first. The third and fourth objects, which were the same as the first two, appeared prior to the second object fading into the cloud cover.  These two were flying much lower, heading in a south eastern direction until nearing the coast line and then began heading north to south again.  The last two were observed for around 4 minutes or so as they made their climb into the clouds.  These two followed one after the other but not in an exact line, the last of the four followed approximately 1 mile behind the other and a tad bit lower.  It also started its climb further south then the one in front of it. Both of these crafts flew upward at an angle and entered the cloud cover much higher than the first two. Not one of the four crafts made any noise that was heard by onlookers and there was no flashing lights, just solid red with an orange hue at the top of the first.

State authorities said no go; they failed to locate anything mysterious. The Republican-American of Waterbury reports that a person driving in Litchfield at about 2 a.m. Tuesday reported that an object the size of a whale fell from the sky and crashed into Bantam Lake. Officials say that at about the same time, a state trooper 10 miles away in Warren called dispatchers to report that something fell out of the sky and landed near Bantam or Morris. Morris fighters made several passes up and down the lake in a boat looking for a possible plane crash, but didn't find any debris. Authorities called off the search, leaving the mystery unsolved. But science may have the answer: According to the National Weather Service, there was a meteor shower that morning, WTNH.com reported. Perhaps the whale-sized object was simply a meteor?

It didn’t go below the trees because it was still above the moon and the moon was at the tree tops. It just vanished.

The only differences were that there was only one instead of multiple like a firework and there was no audible explosion beforehand. Keep in mind, it was 2:15 in the morning so an explosion from a firework or even from a flare would have been clearly audible. Also, it was much bigger than a firework remnant or flare and wasn’t flying directly at the ground like either would.

We went to his house and played video games and came outside to smoke a cigarette and we saw a glowing orange ball about 2 miles away from us.  We weren't very surprised to be honest.  We actually see this type of craft around his house all the time,  the only difference with this time is we saw 16 crafts.  They didn't all look alike though, and they were not all out at the same time.  One of the orange crafts appeared to eject a an object that had red flashing lights on it. I recognized this craft as one of the triangle type ufos that have three lights on the bottom of it.  It got close enough to us to where i could tell that it was not an airplane because there was no noise.  After that, one of the orange crafts got close enough for me to ! see the outline of the craft.  It was disk shaped, just like your standard UFO.  I was even able to make out what appeared to be an observation deck.  However i was not able to see any beings through it even with my binoculars.

Tuesday at about 10:30pm I took my dog out for a walk in the backyard.  I was looking up at the stars and I sometimes do.  I noticed an airplane descending towards Buffalo, NY.  The airplane was brightly flashing and clear, but still high up in the sky to where I could not make out the shape of the plane, but it was obviously a plane due to the speed, straight forward direction it was flying and colors flashing.   Because I was looking at this airplane I noticed another moving object farther to the right.  At first I thought it was a huge star because it was very twinkly.  I realized it was moving.  It appears to be significantly higher up then the airplane.  I can’t make out the shape but I would describe it as a fuzzy ball of light or sparkling star…that’s the best I can do, it is really high up.   I stepped further away from the light on in the backyard to get a better view and still clearly see that the object is moving. It appears to hover in a one spot for a few seconds and then dart back and forth quickly, zigzag, move forward then backward and then quickly forward for 15 seconds and then zing zag again and dart around.  It does not resemble the movement of any airplane I’ve ever seen, does not look like a helicopter or any air craft that I’m familiar with.  I called somebody out of the house to take a look.  They watched with me for almost a full minute and thought it was military night training for some type of aircraft.  I continued watching for 15 minutes and brought the dog inside.   I went back out and found the object after looking for about 10-15 seconds.  It continues to hover for a few seconds and then dart around.  It reminds me of floating, and is just all together odd looking.  I have no idea what it is, but thought I should report it.  It’s really far up there and very easy to miss unless you’re staring at the sky which I was. I don’t have a telescope,  I don’t know where my camcorder is and my camera batters are dead, so I apologize.  I’m sure it’s still going now!  There is only one object.  I looked around that part of the sky and couldn’t find any more.  It’s a white color/light.  I have never seen a ufo before, reported one or anything like that.  I have zero experience with this.

We were just outside of the town of Okarche, OK when we noticed what we thought was an aircraft with a red pulsing light on one end and a blue pulsing light on the other gliding over a field just east of Okarche heading east.  We could only see the lights and not the object itself as it was very dark out.  It struck me as strange as it was moving slowly and had no other beacon or strobe lights normally found on aircraft.

At approximately 2100hrs we were approximately 8 miles east of Okarche when I happened to look to my right (south) and see what appeared to be a tower base of some kind with the same lights on top of it the base right next to a farm house.  Out of curiosity I decided to pull on to a road in front of the farm house (exact addres! s unknown) to see if we could see it up close.  The lights were stationary there approximately tree top level maybe a little higher and approximately 50ft from our position.  It was really dark and we could not make out the shape of the object.  We could only see the lights.  As we pulled up I rolled down my window to get a better look and heard no sound at all except that of traffic on the nearby highway.  We sat there for about 10 seconds looking at the lights when all the sudden the object began moving west away from us which surprised us.  It started off moving slow, however, in the 10 seconds or so it took me to get back on the highway the lights were already approximately 5 miles away heading back towards Okarche.  We were amazed at how far it had travelled in just a 10 second period especially watching it travel so slowly earlier.  We watched it glide back west then north until it was out of sight.  On a side note I had observed the same lights over Okarche about a m! onth prior to this sighting but did not have time to turn arou! nd and c heck it out.

This was suggested by my friend who at one point was pursuing a degree in aviation. It started about 11PM.  I was taking the trash out for our weekly pickup.  When I took the first trash bags out I noticed immediately to the north (orientation of our driveway) that there was an aircraft (almost looked higher, but could have maintained altitude) coming directly at me.   I could tell it was moving slow so I went back in and got my second load of trash bags, but this time I decided to wait to watch this thing fly over.  It had strobes that resembled a normal airplane, but had some other funky strobes.  The bottom of the craft was lit up and it was gray.   The aircraft had to be flying under 500Ft in altitude.  I can tell that it was lower than any prop airplane I have seen  in the area.  It took the craft about 30sec to fly the length of my property which isn't even 150yds in length.   The craft flew immediately overhead and made no sound.  I took a short movie as it was leaving the town, which turned out okay.  Nothing special, shows some strobes, but no other l! ights that I could see with the naked eye.  It took the plane another 4min (approx) to fly out of site.  I noticed it turned to the east for a split second, then back south, and then it appeared the lights just stopped.   I will double check in the AM once there is daylight with my angle that I was standing at that it couldn't have gone behind a building.  I'm a confident that it did not go behind anything however.  If an admin wishes to contact me for the video I can send the youtube link.",2012-06-14T00:00:00,40.826,-83.3137

Then another one not as bright was going in the opposite direction heading right to it and the brighter sphere moved down at a 90 degree angle! And then just kept on going.  The fainter sphere kept going in the other direction and quickly faded away. And then I watched the brighter sphere move across the sky.  It only took about 2 minutes for it to fade completely out of view.  As it faded away it looked just like a star in the sky.  There were no colored or blinking red lights on it. Just a beautiful bright orb looking thing.  I tried to get video of it, but my camera didn't register it.  About 3 minutes later, a plane went over head and I knew the sphere! was definitely not a plane.  The plane made noise and had two bright white lights on each wing and a blinking red light.

I was riding in the car as a passenger with my husband as we were on our way home from babysitting our grandchildren on Wednesday night, June 6, 2012 at around 9:15 PM.  We were heading west and we spotted an unusual object in the sky as it came in over the water just south of BDR (Sikorsky Airport). It was heading from the southwest to the northeast.  It looked like it came over Milford starting at the the Point Lookout area on Long Island Sound and was not travelling at any great speed.  It seemed to maintain level flight as it transited the area. My husband pulled the car over on New Haven Avenue near the intersection of Buckingham Ave. and we both got out to watch the object as it cruised directly above us and we were joined by another passerby who saw the object and pulled over, but we did not get his name. The object glowed orange and yellow, was round in shape and the light it cast was not a type of light I've ever seen before; it was not bright like a landing light, but subdued and sort of pulsed yellow and orange.  There was no sound coming from it and there was no tail like you would see with a meteor or shooting star. It was pretty low too, when it finally disappeared into the clouds, they were scattered but looked between 2,000 and 3,000 feet. It’s hard to estimate size, especially at night, but I can only compare it to that of a full moon compared to the stars, but I am sure that was because it was not at any great altitude.  The siting lasted about 5 minutes until the object disappeared into a cloud. I was a Cessna Dealer back in the 1980’s and worked at Sikorsky Airport where my husband was an air traffic controller.  Though I am not a licensed pilot, my husband, a retired air traffic controller is, and we flew often.  I am familiar with what aircraft look like and sound like and this was no traditional craft.

No aircraft ident. or post. light. Sighting lasted for about 2.5 minutes. Weird movements. Went NE. First I will provide background information on the observers.  Myself the author of this report is an active certificated pilot in the United States as well as a current college student.  I have been watching the sky for my entire lifetime.  I have loved airplanes and anything aviation since I was a child.  I can look at just about any common or uncommon aircraft and tell you about it.  I am not saying I am an aviation expert, rather that I feel like I have some knowledge I could provide on the subject.  As mentioned I have become certificated (Private Pilot), and I am currently studying aviation in college.  I have completed 2 years so far and I am on the path to become a professional pilot. All of which I can verified. The other observer, my fiancé, doesn’t study aviation, but has learned quite a bit during my long evening lectures on the subject. We were returning home from getting takeout and commenting on the stars as we typically do.  We have not had good weather for stargazing in the last several weeks and we just had some cumulus clouds blotting the sky making the stars look crystal clear in most of the sky.  There were light winds coming from the South-Southeast and the humidity was around 70%.  The temperature was also around 60°F.  As we were pulling in to my yard (serves as a driveway) facing due south, we both instantly saw an extremely bright light due south.  From our vantage point, the light was about 70° - 80° off the horizon.  Again, this light was extremely bright.  It instantly grabbed your attention and stood out from the stars very well.  We both exited the car and started studying it.  I immediately started to look for signs of an aircraft.  There was no strobe, beacon, or position lights.  Just one solid bright white light.  There was no size, shape, or definition to the light. Although at times, the light seemed to move back n’ forth getting dimmer than brighter, like some type of oscillation movement from side to side.  Because I could not see any other details than this light, it’s intensity is the only identifier of altitude I had to work with.  Based on the intensity I assume the lights altitude to be approximately 800’ - 1,200’ AGL.  It just seemed to be extremely low, like very low.  At the time I had not thought about it because of the fear that started to set in, but there was absolutely no sound.  I have had many aircraft fly over my house and helicopters.  Anytime there is an aircraft at that approximate altitude flying over my house, my entire house will rumble.  There was no sound emitting from this craft/light, period.  It was completely silen! t.  The speed of the light was slow if my altitude approximation is correct.  At most I could be off maybe + 1000’ AGL, and if that were the case, the light was still travelling at an extremely slow speed and altitude.  I would equate it’s speed similar to an rotorcraft in a very slow cruise configuration.  If it was an aircraft, then that is the only thing it could have been traveling at that slow of a speed (or a ballon).  It was travelling North by Northeast from our perspective at this slow rate of speed.  It was unusual though, because it was travelling not in a straight line, but as my fiancé describes it, “like it was going down steps.”  I reviewed the logs from other sightings and one on the west coast struck my attention when the author said that is was travelling like, “a falling leaf.”  I could use the falling leaf as a better description.  It seemed like it was “looking for something” or even “scanning an area.”  None of the movements were rapid, but rather, extremel! y docile and lethargic.  While viewing it I noticed several flashes of very bright light coming from directly behind me out of the Southwest.  They could be described to be like lightning, but there were no observed cumulonimbus clouds around that and no reports of lightning when I came inside and reviewed the current weather data.  This entire sighting lasted for about 2.5 - 3 minutes at most and it really scared me.  My hairs were up and I felt defensive for both my fiancé and myself.  I have spent my life looking up and have never seen anything like it before.  I can rule out satellites as the light was entirely too bright and low and I obtained satellite information immediately after the sighting, and none were in that area.  I was trying to have a scientific approach for this and rule out as many possibilities as I could.  I have never seen any balloons fly over my house the entire time I have lived here (13-14 years).  It could not have been any conventional aircraft due to the lack of sounds, and there are only a small number of RC enthusiasts in the rural country area where I live and I am one of them (mostly old fashioned control line models in my area).  To the best of my knowledge, none of these people have the capabilities to do this type of flying in the middle of the night with an RC aircr! aft.  The sighting ended due to cloud cover in the Northeast, which  the light disappeared behind.  Realistically, the light probably travelled about 1-2 NM in the timeframe I viewed it, and was heading towards the largest city in my area, Uniontown.  My fiancé did say, “before it went behind the clouds, it seemed like there were a total of three lights that made up the entire light.”  I did not see this myself, but I may have ruined by night vision as I looked at my iPad screen to try and get pictures before we lost sight.  We had the iPad in the car, but I did not get it to take pictures because I was too scared to move.  I had an overwhelming sensation of fear as soon as I realized it wasn’t a plane or anything I had seen before.  If I would have used the iPad to take pictures, they would have yielded almost zero data or information, other than a grainy image of something that looked like a light. This is also the third weird light sighting in 3 weeks.  The other two wer! e not nearly as bright or low, but rather the opposite.  They ! were all outrageously high in the sky and moving at insane speeds.  This third sighting was definitive and scary.  There was also one other weird thing worth mentioning.  During the flight path of the light, it crossed the visual path I had with a star.  When it went in front of the star, it didn’t block out the star, but rather, it “wrapped” the view of the star around it.  It was almost transparent, but seemed to move the star until it was past it, then the star moved back.  A bending like effect which was rather startling.",2012-06-08T00:00:00,39.8417,-79.8958

Location: Casselton, North Dakota (north end of town) Date: April 11, 2012; Time: 21:48   I and my 9 year-old daughter were sitting at a campfire in our backyard and looking at the stars.  It was a totally clear evening with no clouds or moon in sight.  We were looking towards the southeastern sky observing a distance jet aircraft that was moving eastbound.   Suddenly I observed coming from east to west a blur or smudge of lights. For a brief instant I thought a group of meteors were striking the atmosphere simultaneously, at least until my eyes become focused better on the blur of greyish-white lights.  When my eyes were focused completely, I saw an equilateral triangle directly over me moving rapidly to the northwest, but more westerly.  The triangle had 3 dimly-lit lights near the points of the triangle.  I did not notice the color of the craft; however, my daughter thought it was black.  She also asserted that the points on the triangle were rounded as opposed to sharp.  The experience was only 3-5 seconds in length before the craft was out of sight, so each of our br! ains could only process a limited amount of information. The craft made no noise that we could hear.  Because I do not know the size of the craft, it is difficult for me to assess the height and velocity. If it was the length of a mid-sized commercial jet liner, then I would guess that this craft was about 1000 feet about us and moving perfectly straight at 150-200 mph.  This Power Point created image below is the best representation of what I and my daughter witnessed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

I was traveling approximately 80 mph in moderate traffic when I begun to crest the top of the Pass.  I quickly noticed an object in the sky. My immediate thought was it was a Highway Patrol Aircraft patrolling, so I immediately slowed to 70 mph. I then noticed this object clearly did not have wings.  I then thought it must be a helicopter of some type because it didn’t appear to be moving.  The shape stood out to me as almost a pentagon shaped vessel and didn’t seem to have any distinct rotor or tail section.  I would estimate its size to be slightly larger than a big SUV but it’s hard to estimate given the distance of I would guess 150-200 feet. The object appeared to be white or a light grey.  I did not see any lights or additional markings on the object.  It struck me as strange because this object did not appear to be aero dynamic at all and it remained still.  I was able to see it for a period of about 45 seconds continuously.  At which point my position relative to the object was such that my roof prevented me from seeing it. I wasn’t sure what it was, but didn’t pay much more attention to it.  Then I noticed what was a moderate amount of traffic was now almost nonexistent.  There were close to 60 vehicles pulled to the side of the road.  I thought there may be an emergency so I began to slow even more and increase my awareness.  Everyone seemed to be pulling over or already stopped and photographing or looking toward the sky. I was late so I continued to work.  I looked back several times to catch another glimpse of the object. I caught a short 3-4 second glimpse of the object which was now behind me.  I am not sure if it was moving or not.  The really strange thing is from this perspective (assuming it was the same object) has an elongated shape much narrower and taller than the original.  I’m not saying it changed shape and I cannot be certain that it was the same object, only that the position in the sky seemed correct and it was also suspended in a similar manor.   Hoping to hear from one of the motorists pulled over who captured a photo or video. ((NUFORC Note:  Many witnesses in Los Banos area.  Approximately 15 witnesses contacted a newspaper in Los Banos, CA, about the sighting.  We do not know yet what the object was.  PD))",2012-04-18T00:00:00,,

On Monday, April 16, 2012, I was traveling from San Jose, California to Los Angeles, California.  I traveled from 101 Southbound and got onto 152 Eastbound.  I was on 152 E. for approximately 20 minutes (15 miles) before I observed numerous vehicles pulling to the side of the highway and exiting their vehicles.  I saw this going on for several minutes and just figured there was a military plane or helicopter and continued driving.  After another minute I saw some Semi-Trucks pulling over and determined that it must be something of importance, as they have a very heavy load and it’s difficult to stop the Semi-Trucks on the side of the freeway.  This was at 7:34 a.m.  As I exited my vehicle there were multiple people on the other side of the freeway looking in a particular spot.  I immediately grabbed my video camera that is equipped with a 40x Optical zoom and located the object.  I was in complete disbelief because I personally have never believed in UFO’s and though it was a bunch of fairy tail stories.  Once I continued to zoom in and out on the object, I realized it was staying stationary and at a VERY high elevation.  I’m not good at explaining the looks of an object, therefore; I’ll let the video speak my words.  After a couple of minutes I re-entered my vehicle and continued on 152 Eastbound.  After a several minutes of driving and approximately 5 miles, I decided to get a different view/angle on the object if it was still in the sky.   I pulled over next to a large lake off the freeway and went up a side dirt road.  I positioned my vehicle and located the object again.  This time I was further East and mostly got a large glare of the sun off the object.  It almost appeared the object was glowing, but I think it was likely the sun.  As I was video taping the object, a State Ranger drove bye my vehicle at a high rate of speed and though he saw me in a restricted area, he didn’t bother questioning me and appeared he was heading to a certain area of the lake.  I would like to indicate that the object appears to be moving in the video, but I did not have my camera on a tripod and due to the high power zoom, the camera was moving slightly in my hand and the object WAS NOT moving.",2012-04-18T00:00:00,,

Though the lights were not visibly connected by any sort of discernible fuselage, I got the sense that they were each part of one singular craft. The distance between each light was equal. I also got a strong sense that this object was triangular, perhaps equilateral. Moreover, it was quite large; much much larger than any aircraft I’ve seen before. The craft made no discernibly significant shifts in position, neither vertically nor horizontally. It just hovered. Situated over flat terrain, and above a heavily-populated, low-lying residential area, it hung in the night-sky at a relatively low altitude (much lower than planes departing from or approaching Sky Harbor). I was driving south on I-51 at 10:28pm. As I approached Shea’s exit ramp I saw what I thought was an extremely large (and normal) aircraft off to the west; three large orange lights (what looked to be the lighted ends of each wingtip and nose). I passed the exit and soon lost my view of the object due to topography (a small mountain range just beside the road within northwest section of Phoenix Mountain Preserve, west side of the 51). Beyond this exit, I-51 makes a series of curves through the range. Coming around the last major bend (near Dreamy Draw), I gained sight of the object again. I thought it looked quite peculiar, but I almost wrote it off as nothing special. I continued to look at it as I came around the curve, and finally decided to pull off onto the shoulder to get a better look. Trees obstructed the view, but I could see two of the tree lights through the branches. I slinked over the center console into the passenger seat, pulled my binoculars out of the glove box, opened the passenger window, and saw that it was definitely no ordinary craft. Since the object looked like it was going to move out of the trees any moment, I waited for about 10 seconds before I grew impatient. I jumped out of the car (with the binoculars) and walked 15 ft up the shoulder (north), giving me a clear view of the object straight west. Three large orange lights hovered over north-central Phoenix. From where I was standing the object was almost eye-level, but slightly higher. Its distance was too hard to judge, but if I had to guess, I’d say it was roughly 500 yards away. Maybe more. This didn’t seem to be an ordinary craft because: 1) the lights on the craft were orange; 2) given its distance from me, the lights on the craft were very very large (about the size of a racquet ball held away at arm’s length); 3) the punctuated distance of one light from another signified a wingspan significantly larger than any craft I’ve ever seen before; and 4) It hovered (demonstrating no positional shifts). I heard nothing but the traffic of I-51, thus if any sound was associated with the object, it was not heard. I watched it for about 4 minutes. At one point the object seemed to be coming closer as the lights grew slightly larger. Then the object seemed to slowly retreat, as the lights got smaller and more defined (i.e. the edge of each light became much sharper, less hazy).  At this point I decided to try to exit the freeway and head west along Glendale to get a better look.  Being on a really unsafe section of the road, parked on a narrow shoulder, I decided I best be moving along anyway. As soon as I left the shoulder of I-51 I lost sight of the object. When I exited at Glendale, the object remained unseen as I drove west to central (about 3.5 miles) and decided to turn around and continue down the 51.  Either visibility hindered my ability to see the object, or the object was no longer present. Given the size, location, and duration of time the object was visible, I’d have a hard time believing I was the only one who saw this. I snapped a photo, but it is extremely blurry.",2012-06-08T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

I watch the international space station fly over all the time; this was much closer to the Earth and moved at least five times faster.  It was not bright like the space station.

A friend called me from Amesbury Mass describing 3 erratically flashing lights he was currently viewing.  He was uncertain of direction (initially claiming they were north of him, but finally determining they were west), but I located them approx SSW of my location.  From his perspective, they appeared stationary, but from mine they crossed approx. 30 degrees of horizontal arc in less than 10 minutes (a better estimation of time will be determinable once we examine his cell phone records - we were in constant contact throughout the initial portion of the event).  To me, they appeared white, but I am a known deuteranope deficient with particular problems identifying colors of faint lights.  From my perspective, they were very low on the horizon (less than 10 degrees) and for the most part they were clearly visible just above the silhouette of a treeline.  We continued joint observation until I could no longer detect a flash for more than 30 seconds.  Towards ! the end of our communication, he claimed the initial 3 were joined by from 3 to 5 more lights, but I could not see them.  I then went inside to check Google maps to estimate trajectory, went back outside to confirm compass direction relative to visible landmarks, and witnessed one additional flashing object apparently following the same approx flight path, although this time the flashing had more of a pattern than previously observed (accounting for atmospheric disturbance - the ""twinkle"" effect).  This second viewing was not made in conjunction with my friend, so position wouldbe much more difficult to determine, and may in fact have been a chase aircraft or even totally unrelated.

It looked rather similar to a meteor or firework with a very bright and rather thick orange, fiery tail (which had a bright orangish-yellow band within its core) that tapered out roughly 30 feet from the object itself. It was not a meteor, however, due to the fact that its trajectory was upward (as opposed to towards the ground); it shot into the sky at about a 45 degree angle.  I'm positive it was not a firework; its tail was an extremely vivid, almost fluorescent orange, unlike anything I've seen before.   The air was still and dead silent. Its path was also slightly arched, which seemed to mimic the shape of a nearby tree canopy's silhouette. My view was obstructed by a few trees, but I got a clear shot of th! e object through a pocket of clear space between trees.   I was not able to see the object that produced the fiery tail, however, as it was much smaller than the tail itself, and traveled away much too quickly.  It seemed to be rather close though; between 50-200 yards away and only 40-60 feet off the ground.   And though I cannot say with 100% certainty, I also feel the object disappeared when I lost sight of it (as opposed to me losing visibility); it just vanished, much like shooting stars do as they fall toward the ground. This occurred near sky harbor airport, beneath incoming/outgoing flight lines, yet at this early hour no incoming red-eye planes were present.

First couple of stars in the sky were barely visible.  Planes and boats were still plainly visible.  All of a sudden relatively large golden/orange ball appeared and glowed brightly for approx. 1-2 seconds then faded quickly.  A 2nd appeared and faded in the exact same fashion right beside the first.  A third and then 4 appeared/faded in the exact same fashion.  All appeared in an exactly straight line.  5 appeared, glowed and faded directly below the line of the other 4.  All appeared and faded sequentially.  When the first faded, the second appeared 1-2 seconds later. when 2nd faded the 3rd appeared and so on.  Entire incindent lasted approx. 10-15 seconds.  As I explained planes and other objects were still plainly visible as it was dusk.  There were not other objects associated with these lights.  Although it was fairly clear with no cloud reference, they appeared to be a few miles away and quite large.  The lights were significantly larger and significantly brighter than the planes arriving and departing the airport a few miles to the south.  The glow was similar to a firey color/fashion - what I imagine a fighter jet engine flare would look like if you were looking directly into its tail.  As if a jet went full throttle and then quickly throttled back.  Only much larger.  It almost appeared to burn and disappear like a flare only each light was perfectly stationary.  When it was over I looked around to see if anyone else had seen it and there was only an asian couple - like any ignorant American, I naturally assumed wouldn't speak english and didn't talk to them :) I asked several couples that walked by if they'd seen it but no one else seemed to have been looking.  I kept watching the sky for 15 min but saw nothing else.  Either way feel very lucky to have witnessed something so spectacular.  From a cursory search of Google, I'm one of several dozen folks who have seen such a thing a Myrtle Beach over the last 5 years.",2012-04-18T00:00:00,33.68315,-78.93953909574468

Object remained still for several more minutes, then began to track East, very slowly at constant altitude. Object again appeared to stop, then track the opposite direction (West). This occurred within the span of roughly 5 minutes. Intensity, shape, and color of object appeared to remain constant throughout. At this point, I got in my car to reposition myself once again, following it toward the Auburn Auction park from Leo area. At this point, I could see the object clearly, and it appeared to be moving away from me in a West heading (possibly just north of highway 3?). I continued to follow th! e object through LaOtto on highway 205, at this point, it appeared to be north and west of my position on the highway. I maintained intermittent view of the object when trees did not obstruct. I lost sight of the object about 5 miles before reaching Churubusco.

My background is in graphic design, and have lived near airports all of my life (managed to foolishly rent 2 apartments directly under airport landing patterns).  The intensity of this yellow/white orb is unlike anything I have seen, and the maintaining of the low altitude was alarming.  I observed other aircraft in the sky at the time (aircraft tend to circle nearby for the local Int Airport), and this was strikingly different in both shape, size, color, and altitude.

I was away on vacation in the Cape Verde islands on the island of Santiago from May 23, 2012 to June 1, 2012/.  The area of the island I was staying was very quiet and desolate, facing the ocean and a near by Island was visible off in the distance. On the night of May 30, 2012, I was admiring the moon and how it appeared to have set into the ocean.  The stars were very visible and abundant.  A friend and I noticed one particular star that appeared to be glowing and moving as if on an axis.  While noticing this ""star"", we observed an orange strobe moving toward that ""star.""  The orange strobe was pointed out as an airplane by my friend. This orange strobe was moving faster than a plane given the distance away.   As it approached the ""star,"" the orange strobe circled around it, the ""star"" appeared to move, and the orange strobe vanished.   My friend and I were puzzled and we called to another friend to come outside and view the ""star."" While calling a third friend to come outside, a very bright light appeared in the sky and moved faster than anything I had ever seen.  If the ""star"" was at 1 o’clock on an imaginary clock in the sky, then this very bright light I believed was a shooting star, was at 12 o’clock.  This event was so bright and so fast that it startled me and my friend.  This occurred around 0030 hours Cape Verde time, which is 3 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time. While still noticing this ""star"" appearing to be on an axis and moving, we observed another orange light, appearing to be blinking.  This orange strobe moved from 1 o’clock to about 5 o’clock over about 10 minutes.  I had time to go inside the residence, running, to get a camera with the hopes of capturing a photograph or a video.  I retrieved the camera but based on its low quality, it could not capture my observations.   The orange strobe vanished after being viewed for approximately 10 minutes. A third orange strobe was located and observed travelling from left to right in the same area and height but from 1 o’clock to only about 3 before vanishing.  The first strobe described above was viewed travelling from right to left and vanished after circling near the ""star.""  This ""star"" was located in the area where the moon was last seen before it set into the ocean.  This ""star"" was also located in the area where the neighboring island was visible during the daylight hours. At some point, we observed another flash of light and or shooting star.  From where we were standing, this occurred directly above us at the center of the sky.  This was not nearly as bright as the first event described above. These events had me absolutely sure that the objects I could see were not airplanes.  I believed this is the first time in my life that I have ever witnessed a UFO, or several.  The activity in this area was unlike anything I have ever seen. I spoke to a pilot who works out of Praia International Airport who stated that there are no airplanes that should be travelling at that altitude at that time.  I attempted to research the FAA to research any flights in the area during these hours but was unsuccessful. I hope that you can shed some information on what I may have observed.

The sighting first started with one object that was pointed out by my neighbor.  It looked like a helicopter that had 3 different lights blinking on the back, middle, and front, all blinking randomly.  We had thought it might have been a helicopter on fire.  It had a somewhat long oval shape and it made no sound. While we were observing the first object, my girlfriend, neighbor, and his mother accompanied me to the middle of the street to get a better view (because there was tree obstruction).  Once we got to the middle of the street we saw another set of objects (3) moving from left to right at the same speed and keeping the same distance from each other.  These objects however did not seem to be as close to us as the first object. At this time the rest of the neighbors came out, and more objects kept coming into view. I wasn't sure if they were suddenly appearing or have been traveling for some time as the treeline was still obscuring some of the view.  The objects all had a white with orange tint to them.  They still seemed to have a blinking type of flickering to them in some way (similar to the first object sighted).  The objects all seemed to be independent of each other, but noticed near the end of the sighting ( where my video starts) one object pattern had the classic triangle shape.  It moved also at the same speed as the other objects. The objects all seemed to have suddenly just went out at around the same area in the sky as they kept passing from left to right. (not sure of the cardinal directions)   No flickering, or fading, just suddenly gone.  However each light seemed to disappear right after one another. (which makes me think the triangle shape was not one craft)   The sighting lasted for about 5 minutes.   There was no sound. I cannot determine the height of the objects, but it seemed to be around the same altitude as any other normal aircraft. (which prompted me to think the first object was a helicopter as I am used to seeing lights in the sky at this distance with sound and the usual light patterns of normal aircraft.)

A glowing red object was observed from the second story of my house at 11:24pm the night of  June 1, 2012. A single, large red light was seen over the neighbor's horse pasture and community pond.  The object was silent and enveloped in a swirl of thin fog.  The red light shone steadily and did not fade, wink out, or move.  Because of the thin fog swirling around, the rays of light coming out of the red object was reminiscent of old illustrations of illumined beings stepping out of the sky. I had just been looking out another window on the same side of the house, finished in that room and walked down the hall, past two other rooms to check on the window in the small bedroom.  That's when I saw it. In the no more than 12 seconds it took for me to walk from one bedroom to the next and open the drapes, it appeared. The object remained in a stationary position, suspended at about 200 feet in the air. I watched it for about a minute.  As I watched this strange red object, I started to feel as though I was being hypnotized.  I felt a panic begin to envelop me, a growing fear of what it might do.  This is what really surprised me more than anything during this whole event, the fear of some unknown evil glowing red and watching my neighborhood.  I pulled myself away from the window, partly to share the news and partly to get away from it. I ran across the hall to inform other family members, then returned to resume my watch.  I went to a different room on the same floor to see if I might be able to see more than just the light, perhaps to see the definition of some larger shape.  Alas, when I looked out that window, the glowing red light had vanished. In the time I saw it, probably a minute and the less than a minute   I spent running from one room to another, it vanished.  The entire episode was concluded by 11:27pm. No other family members saw it.  For some time afterward, we looked out other windows, but did not see anything that could have been identified as the red light.  We did not go outdoors. The weather conditions were: light breeze, slight drizzle, thin fog, damp air. No moon or stars were observed, which is not uncommon in Western Washington.  The cloud cover often obscures the night sky.  There were no traffic noises from the highway a half a mile away.  No night birds sang or dogs barked.  No airplanes or helicopters broke the still night air.  The only sound was the sound of frogs from the nearby pond.  Because of the drizzle, no backyard fires glowed in the neighborhood either. Everyone was indoors.  It was an usually quiet Friday night.",2012-06-05T00:00:00,47.0173,-122.2968

At approximately 9pm we were walking west on the camp road to catch the trail to the restroom. I noticed some unusual orange glowing lights overhead and to our right which I pointed out to my friends.  The lights were tracking way above and slightly to the right of a power line cut through forested land.   There was no sound.  The initial lights I saw were clustered in a small group.  I didn’t count them but there were about 5 with a couple other ones trailing behind.  They were not symmetrically spaced. I observed about 18-20 of these orange glowing lights in a period of about 20 minutes.  After the initial cluster of lights, the ones that followed were singular and more spaced out. As my friends and I marveled at the lights, I recalled that my binoculars were in the car and ran back to get them. I also called another woman over from another campsite to observe the lights.  Through my binoculars I could see that the lights were perfectly round.  They were not solid colored orange but appeared to have grey shadows without a distinctive pattern.  They resembled brain matter. In the lower left quadrant of two of them, there appeared to be electrical activity like spidery lightening.  While the perimeters were perfectly round, some appeared to have noticeable grey colored fissures that ran out to the perimeter.  The only exceptions to the perfectly spherical lights were two that appeared to morph somewhat into elliptical shapes.  I don’t know if this could have been a distortion of my binoculars or not. The lights came from west to east and were moving at a relatively fast rate.  They were much larger than a planet but smaller appearing than the moon.  They appeared to be at the altitude that a small plane would fly and the later ones followed one another along the same path.  A short distance after passing where I were standing, they ascended upward and disappeared.  There was cloud cover as they ascended so I couldn’t discern if they were hidden by the clouds, ascended out of sight or evaporated. Upon returning home I checked with NOAA in Portland and found that the wind was coming from the west that night at about 10 mph at the surface.  Aloft to 3000’ the wind was blowing west to southwest at 15-20 mph.   I have never seen anything like this in my life and am splitting with curiosity to know what they were.

However, the tower seemed to have lights to spread at the top on both sides which made me curious.   I told the boys to look at it and they were amazed.  It appeared that the lights began to move. They were a red color and circular in shape.  They seemed to start spreading out in different directions and it was very weird.  We arrived home and I went in to get my husband to come see.  There was only 1 or 2 left in the sky at that time, but he did see one.  My son and his friend said the others had moved to one spot in the sky behind a cloud and dissappeared.   As we watched the last one move toward the same area as the others, it seemed to flicker. It then reached the same area and dissappeared in as cloud and did not come out on the other side.  We of course wondered about airplanes but there would not be that many planes that close together or moving in different directions.   We also thought maybe helocopters, but did not think again that there would be that many that close together.   There was also no sound at all.

There had to be more than 10 in the sky around the same area that night, which doesn't seem very safe. It wasn't until I was crossing the bay farm bridge that I saw a triangular shaped aircraft swaying downward left and right like a leaf that I thought...something is seriously not right. I look around again and notice all the aircrafts I saw were either gone or my much much farther except for three above what I know as trash mountain (the gated off blonde grassy area on bay farm side near the bridge/bike path). They were far enough to only be perceived as lights but close enough to see them change colors from blue red purple orangish white.  They were all moving delicately and began to form a PERFECT triangle.  Then it began to move counterclockwise STILL keeping the perfect formation and STILL changing colors.  These color changes werent flashy or quick.  They were slow and almost faded into one another.  After the lights stopped turn they branched off one by one to form a perfect line with perfect spacing in between.  By that point I had to turn right and it was on the left ! side of the bridge so I could no longer see it.  I have seen small bright stars in the night sky that have the same color fading effect that i have not noticed before this year.  I usually see them in three as well, either creating an elongated line or decently distantanced triangle, but still very exact form from what I make of it.",2012-06-05T00:00:00,37.768319587628866,-122.27405773195876

Upon leaving and driving westbound on 104 toward I-93, I began to feel short of breath. I told my husband that something wasn’t right.  Thinking it was just a physical affliction we opened our windows just a bit to get some fresh air.   My husband in rolling down his window (driver’s side facing north) he stated, “OH MY GOD, What ((deleted)) is that!?”  I have never heard my husband ever get scared but his voice sounded shaky.   I thought at first maybe he saw some animal he was not used to seeing as he was staring somewhat back over his shoulder out the window while driving.   I got mad and told him to stop and pay attention to the road.  He insisted I look out the driver’s side backseat window.  His urging me lasted at least 2 minutes. 	I finally leaned backed over the middle divider between us and looked out the driver’s side backseat window and stated to him I see nothing.  He said, “NO, look up, look at the sky.. those lights WTF is that?!!!”   What I saw was these reddish orange lights… they were either hovering or moving extremely slow.  They appeared to be over the wild life preserve there. Possibly over Peak Hilled Rd.  There seemed to be no geometric formation but rather they were in a line, not straight line but sort of zigzagged line.  They made no sound and moved entirely too slow to be a plane.  The lights seemed fuzzy or flickering as if they were on fire and did not blink nor did were they sharp like a plane or helicopter would be.  There were no clouds in the sky so I ruled out the possibility of clouds making the lights look like that.  My kids (all 5 years and under) were scared.  My husband didn’t dare stop.  I watched them out of the window until we got close to the highway where the trees blocked out view.  When the lights came back into view they remained in the same spot for a few seconds and then vanished. 	Once we got onto the highway at exit 23 heading south, I looked back north east to see if they had reappeared or if maybe I had just lost sight of them and they were nowhere to be seen.  We had never seen or heard of anything like it.   I decided to google what we saw and found that there are multiple reports from all over the world just in 2013.  I firmly believe what we saw was a UFO.   I am a counselor and study psychology in college and critically analyze everything I see or read. I have come to no other conclusion but that it was in fact UFOs.  I thought that maybe it would be a good idea to report it.",2013-07-14T00:00:00,43.6271,-71.7813

Hello, I am writing this letter because I believe that I have seen a real UFO. I am a college student studying to become a lawyer and I have a real case UFO. On Friday, April 5, 2013 in a small town called Hilmar California I saw what I believe was a UFO. I was going home from a buddy’s house, and I had my two friends with me but I needed to drop them off first. We were heading towards the McDonald’s in town in order to pass through Hilmar and take my friend home when I noticed something in the sky.  At first I thought it was a plane because I noticed some blue lights that were blinking, but as we got closer I noticed that it was coming to a stop seemingly.  We started to approach a stop light right next to the McDonald’s and I became somewhat terrified.  What at first I thought to be a plane turned to be a triangular shaped object in the sky, with blue, white, orange, green and red lights blinking underneath its base.  I saw no wings and the lights had a pattern to them, and there were 3 different light patterns. 	At first I couldn’t believe my eyes and I was thinking of what it could possibly be.  I noticed that it was basically above us, or somewhat above us, but only a couple hundred feet above the earth. The object seemed to be about as big as a car or a little bit bigger.  And I noticed a tail at the end.  The tail is what tripped me out the most, because of the unusual way that it was moving.  This was not a metallic tail or anything hard and solid.  I could tell because it was moving very rapidly from side to side, like how a snake would slither across the ground. The tail was very faint looking as well, not solid or really noticeable per say. 	At first me and my friends were discussing the possibilities as to what it could be. A friend of mine could only bring up a kite.  I was looking for a string but I could not make it out or see a string or anything else that could have been attached to the object.  Then I came to my senses, and told my friend that there was next to no wind outside.  If it was a kite, the person would have to run quite a bit of distance in order to create enough wind for the kite to take off.  I could not see a single person on the sidewalks and again, I could not see a string attached.  Then I also asked my friend about the tail.  As too why the tail was only moving from side to side, instead of up and down with the wind. And especially since the object was not moving one bit, it was completely stationary.  So I asked my friend why the tail was only moving and not the object?  And he could not respond to me. 	The really weird thing was, this was at 8:30 at night, and I can’t imagine anyone that would fly a kite at that time of night, because it was completely dark outside now.  And once more, this looked to be like directly above us, and a couple other cars that were at the stop light also noticed the object and were pointing at it.  I believe this was a real UFO because I just can’t think of anything else that it could have been.  I researched kites with lights, expensive kites, and design kites, and nothing seemed to be like what I saw.  This looked to be a lot heavier than a kite would have been, and it looked just as big as a car or a bit bigger. That was really weird and I will never forget what I saw that night.  I mean, at a distance, and I mean a couple 1000 yards or so I saw this thing moving, and as I got closer it stopped, and I didn’t see anyone holding a string or even a string attached to it at all, and the aerodynamics don’t make sense either.  Why was the tail only mov! ing and the whole object was completely stationary.  Around the object was a black glare kind of, like I couldn't really see the edges of object, so it was kind of blending in with the night sky.

I live next to a lake which is quite dark and deserted around the late evening.  As i was walking my dog along the water i noticed a large light in the distance but ignored it thinking that it was a helicopter with the spotlight on, possibly looking for a criminal and i also saw what appared to be a plane chasing or observing its actions.  As i continued walking, i noticed clouds moving in fairly quickly around the sky but wasnt bothered by it because it was coming in fast but not too abnormally fast.  There was also one rather large dark cloud that began to cloak the moon so it became eclipsed, but you could still see a glow around the cloud.  i found this strange because when i began my walk, there were only a few clouds but soon began to look like a light fog or mist.  As i got towards the end of the trail next to the lake, my dog decided to urinate on a plant as he normally does. Usually wh! en my dog has to stop, i take my time to enjoy my music and stare at the sky and the stars. As my dog urinated, i looked up at the sky and saw the light again but this time it wasnt as far into the distance as before, but still relatively far away.  I stared at the light and tried to determine what it was, and noticed it had a spherical shape with a glow around it.  The light made a slow and small left to right motion and hovered there and then bolted past the trees and dissapeared, i am not sure if the object emitted noise because i was listening to music but a couple seconds before i noticed the light, my phone lost reception but this only lasted a few seconds then returned to normal still before i had noticed the light. This could not have been a comet because the sky was cloaked with clouds at this point and you could barely see the moons glow past the dark clouds and this light was bright and too large to be a comet. I also thought it could be a missile, because of the ! recent threats made by north korea but a missile could not hav! e made t hat left to right motion and just hover. This could not have been a plane or helicopter because of the speed it was traveling as it left, it was going at the rate of shooting star; possibly even faster. Prior to leaving my house, i heard rain outside my window for about less than 5 minutes, as well as 2 or 3 car alarms going off but am not sure if it ties into the sighting. after seeing this light, i ran home out of fear and panic along with my dog. Im scared, because i don't know what i saw tonight and feel slightly traumatized because it is the strangest thing i've seen in my whole life.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,37.54167687366167,-122.31694464668094

Earlier I was admiring the huge bright moon while it slipped below the tree line.  As I was taking a pill I looked up and saw 2 lights, shaped oval, hovering over an old Bomarc missile base about a mile or so to the Northwest, just appear out of the darkness. They just hovered there for about a minute not changing color or shape.  I awoke my wife to see these lights, and just as she moved to see out the window they started moving to the East.  They made no noise and the clear white light just kind of flickered slightly.  They moved off to the east from the point I first saw them.  Now I am a pilot with over 1200 hours in my log book and, who's father was a navigation tech. With both the USAF and with the Federal Aviation Admin.  I grew up around Loring AFB and the Presque Isle airport (along with many nav sights in northern Maine).  My point here is these lights were between me and the Bangor VOR, which sits a few miles off the north end of Bangor International Airport. There were no strobe or anti collision  lights, no wing position lights, a red light should have been visible as they were approaching me and the left wing would have a red light marking it.   As i said earlier, there was no sound at any time.  The lights were about 2 to 3 football fields apart from the time the appeared until they moved out of my sight.  I see aircraft flying over and around home most every day.  BIA is the home of the 101st air refueling wing, flying KC 135 Stratotankers, which make a huge noise on take off and cruising overhead.   Also we have a helicopter unit stationed here, flying UH 60 Blackhawks, which are also noisy.  The lights approached no closer than  2 football fields near me.

I live in Spring, Texas.  I was in my backyard with my dogs somewhere between 10:15 and 10:45pm Saturday March 23, 2013.  I noticed what looked like a bright reddish light approaching high in the northwest and moving towards the southeast.  The light was singular and had no additional lights like the blinking lights you’d normally see on aircraft.  Still in the northwest, the light appeared to slow, then almost rise up and disappear into the cloud cover. I took one dog in the house and returned to stay with my second one. Looking back to the Northwest I noticed another two lights travelling in the same southeast direction.  Thinking that the first one was odd, I decided to keep my focus on these next lights to see what they did.  The two lights were not too close to one another; spaced almost like aircraft that are in a specific flight pattern when coming into an airport.  The lead light (again a singular light) started out red and became a little whiter as it got closer.  Originally I thought this was because of the cloud cover, atmospheric conditions, etc.  It too disappeared into the cloud cover, but I decided to keep focused on the sky where it disappeared.  Within a few seconds, a black mass appeared in the sky moving in the same path as the light.  It was low and continued on the same southeast trajectory.   It moved silently in the sky over my house, right above me and continued southwest, disappearing over the horizon.  The mass was black against the low cloud cover and low.  It was t! riangular shape although not defined (like that of a fuselage and wings).  There was no sound as it passed over or preceding it after it disappeared. Whatever the object was, it was fairly low and moved at a steady pace to the southeast.  There was no visible light at this point on the object.  The moon was partially visible through the upper cloud cover.  The object was a solid black mass.  At the altitude it was at, I’m guessing the size of a small jet, but again appearing solid and flat from my vantage point.  I also observed two more of these ‘fireball type lights’ that seemed higher in the sky in the northwest. These were also travelling toward the southeast.  The final two that I observed, were not visible together.  One appeared and disappeared in the cloud cover in the northwest and then the second, also disappearing in the high cloud cover in the northeast.  Each of these appeared to slightly move west right before they disappeared.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,30.106909170305677,-95.4739580786026

She said she and next door neighbor observed a dark, moving and hovering UFO for a short time period (1 or 2 minutes?).  It displayed some orange “cones” while in view. She sounded like a novice even though she sounded very credible and had observed another UFO about a year before. One thing, she needs to be specific about her siting location (near near Cottonwood Mall; or in So. Salt Lake; Avenues area; etc.). Also, she needs to estimate the size and movement characteristics of the UFO (only “east” and “west”, from her location just doesn't do it). Would you please advise her to contact (soon) the Utah Chapter of MUFON through its state director (Max Mitchell, email is maximumtenn@gmail.com).

Hello I would like to tell you a story  Now this story did happen, it happened a few years ago. It all started around the Mormon Handcart Pageant.  I know I put a date for the event but I actually couldn’t remember the day. I know it happened in July 2010 at around 10 to 11 pm. Now, to the story. It was near the river scene and I was on my break.  I went up to a deck where people cross to sit on the bleachers.  No one of course crossed it because they were watching the pageant.  I looked up at the sky.  It was clear and filled with stars. But suddenly I looked to westward at the sky.  An orange oval object appeared. It was wavy and some parts glowed yellow.  To me it looked like it was on fire.  The object went to fast for a plane but seemed the like the source was also smaller than the plane and the glow made it seem bigger.  I watched the object float or fly across the sky. No one was watching and I didn’t make a sound.  You know how objects seem to go around up past mountains because the earth is round.  Well the object d! idn’t seem to do that. As if it broke laws of physics. I watched it go towards Mt Nebo.  But it seemed to me that it passed it already but I could still see it.  Like it went higher at a steady angle as if I was now looking at the back of the ship. The light started to dim and started to get harder to see. But suddenly it grew and grew brighter and brighter then it disappeared then BAM. There was no sound but a flash of yellow white light showed up of where the object was.  And then it was gone. I was stunned at the event. So you see the object didn’t seem to be on earth or in its atmosphere but out in space. Time passed and I spent time thinking about it. I think it was a space ship or “UFO” but it was in space and something happened to it. And it traveled through a worm hole then traveled some more then prepared to do another worm hole then launched again. To me it seemed damaged.  I hope you believe me. I know this happened.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,39.6873,-111.8309

At approximately 21:25 my 2 year old nephew (whom I was babysitting), came running in from the dining room yelling, ""Amu! Amu!"", his word for airplane.   Being excited he drug me by my finger into the dining room to look at the plane out the window. When I first saw it, I said, ""Yeah, airplane.""  All I saw was a seemingly perfectly round ball of white light in the distance.  After a few moments of staring, waiting for the light to move, I realized that something didn't seem right, this did not seem like an airplane.  It didn't seem like it was moving at all.  I thought at first that I was letting my mind wander or that my eyes were playing tricks on me because it seemed as if the light was getting slightly larger by the minute but not moving.  I then felt (not really thought but felt [I know it sounds strange]) like the light was getting bigger because it was moving closer.  I was literally frozen in fear, staring at this light trying to figure out what was happening. I began looking around, taking mental notes of the surroundings.  This light was lower than the radio towers, but higher than the tree tops.  I cannot describe the feeling that overcame me staring at this light any other way than ""primal fear"".  It was a gut-wrenching, nauseating feeling that told your brain to run but you can't go anywhere because you're in the house.  I called my father on the house phone and told him to look out of his back window towards my aunt's house (my parents lived approximately 3 miles away). I told him about the light, and I told him that if he looked to the south to the right of the radio tower he might be able to see it.  He couldn't see it.  I got up the nerve to go back to the window and when I looked out,  I couldn't see it anymore.  My dad convinced me to go outside and look around to see if I could find it and tell him where it was.  I reluctantly picked up my nephew and carried him onto the back porch with me.  I looked in all four compass directions and didn't see the light.  Then I looked up. Above the house (I cannot begin to estimate height....I just know that it appeared that if it were any closer it would take off the roof of the house) I saw a huge triangular craft.  The white light that I had been seeing was on the very front tip of the craft.  There were two more lights on the back corners of the craft.  There were no visible windows or doors and there was absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, no sound.  The craft appeared to have perfect lines ""dissecting"" it, similar to a pyramid.  The color was as close to a perfect match to the color of the sky as possible, without being the sky itself.  I truly believe that the only reason I was able to see it was because of the street lights adding extra light to the sky. I stood on the back porch telling my dad what I was seeing, yelling at him when he said he couldn't see it, ""How can you not see it?!  It couldn't be any bigger!""  This craft appeared (I keep saying appeared and seemed because it was in the sky, I can only guess by the visual markers I had on the ground) to reach from halfway over the house to halfway through the yard, and seemed to be moving extremely slowly.  I stood there looking up at it for approximately 1-2 minutes as it took that long for it too completely pass over the house.  As the tail end began crossing the roof I ran into the house, set my nephew down, and ran out onto the front porch so that I could keep track of where it was, hoping that my father would be able to see it now.  As I reached the front porch, I realized it was gone.  I ran into the yard and nothing.  It was absolutely gone. I still wonder if it was really gone or if I just couldn't see it anymore.  While standing under it, like I said it was practically the color of the sky, it appeared to have something in it's coloring that allowed it to ""change"" color or reflect the surrounding light to allow it to camouflage itself completely into the sky. I went and spoke the following day with a friend that was a longtime member of the Air Force.  He had posters of every known military air craft.  I asked him if he knew of any practice runs over the area that might not be public knowledge, etc. and he did not.  Together we went through every picture he had and could not find it.  The most astounding part to him was the fact that there was absolutely no sound emitted, not even a hum or a buzz. (To note, there were no visible windows or doors on the craft.  Also the craft was moving south to north.  I will never forget what I saw that night, but have finally decided to report it.  I don't talk about it much and I had no idea until tonight that there was actually a place you could go to report your sightings.   There was another (different) incident approximately 5 years later at my parents' house; however, that experience will not be disclosed in this report.  If someone would like to discuss this over the phone I will; however, I will never disclose that experience in a paper report.)",2013-05-15T00:00:00,,

Duschene (near), UT Shape: Disk Duration:10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97248.html,"Woman, 20s, sees round object near Ft. Duchesne, UT I was a two-to-three-year-old child when my father was transferred to a small government boarding school for American Indian children during WWII.  The school was the now-closed White Rocks Indian School near Fort Duchesne in northeastern Utah. My mother tells the story that, while we were there, she took me out for a walk near the school.  I understand that many UFOs are spotted in the Fort Duchesne area today, with some speculation by some that there may be a UFO base in the area. During our afternoon walk, my mother said, a large, silvery object came into sight and made a 360 flight around us, then left.  My mother, for decades, thought the object might have been one of the incendiary-device balloons launched by the Japanese Imperialist forces from the Japanese home islands during the War.  The Japanese hoped to start fires on the American mainland, and would launch them between November 1944 and April 1945—again, about the time I was two or three. Some 9,300 fusen bakudan literally “balloon bomb” devices were sent aloft.  About 300 were observed.  They were an ineffective weapon, though six people across the western U.S. were killed by the devices.  Damage from the bombs was slight. However, when I became an adult, I asked my mother some questions about what she saw that day.   She gave essentially the same explanation as above again.  I asked if she would draw it.   She drew a round object that may have been a balloon.  However, she apparently did not see a dangling incidenary device or bomb.  I think that, at the height she report—about 500 feet above us—the device would have been plainly visible. I then asked what else she noted about what she saw.  She said that the device either shimmered or sort of shook while in flight. The object then, as I said, departed—I'm not certain whether to say it drifted off or flew away. I was young enough that I don't remember the incident though I do remember some other happenings of the time, none of which involved a UFO. I suppose I would not be filing a report, except for the facts that the object made the complete circle around us, and the object had a pecular movement.

Earlier this year I had a sighting of an aerial object from my house was mthat aybe not so incredible, but unexplained nonetheless. This sighting took place at approximately 9pm from my home in Sarasota, Florida. I was outside on my deck talking on the phone with a friend when I spotted an unusaul white light in the night sky at just about a 45 degree angle traveling at a slow, steady speed, at what looked like a linear path approaching me from the South in a North or Northeast heading. This light was about the size of a pencil eraser or around 3x the size of the brightest star Sirius, but not as brilliant.  I asked my friend if he could see anything and he confirmed he did.  He was about 12 miles Northwest of me in the neighboring town of Bradenton.  He was further from the object than I was and it would have been lower in the horizon from his point of view, but he still had an unobstructed view since the land here is completely flat.  He was excited like myself, and urged me to bring out my telescope to have a closer look. I wanted to but I did not want to miss anything, and I was afraid the object would have disappeared by the time I set up my telescope (about 2 minutes time in a hurry). Both of us agreed this was not a Satellite, much too large and traveling too slow at what appeared to be an altitude of 10,000 ft. or so, definitetly not orbital. I also ruled out a helicopter because there was no sound. I still had not ruled out a possible large aircraft on approach to Sarasota/ Bradenton airport. It was not far off the appoach path commercial jet airliners take, and so I thought it might be the nose and wing lights appearing as one light head on, as they often do.  As the light traveled east of me and I was looking at it from the side, this now seemed unlikely. In addition, there were no red and green navigation lights, and again there was no sound.  After 3-4 minutes of this white light traveling in the sky, it suddenly changed to a red color! The best way I could describe it was the white light was extinguished and turned to a more subduded deep red color. It appeared to continue to travel in the same direction and speed. This lasted for maybe 5-10 seconds and then it disappeared all together. I immediately asked my friend to describe what he saw, and he collaborated what I just witnessed. We couldn't believe it! I continued to scan the skies for several more minutes, but saw nothing further.  Summing this up, I witnessed a large white-lighted object for a duration of approximately 4 minutes, traveling in the night sky at a slow rate of speed, then suddenly turning red before disappearing. The light was always steady, not strobed. Impossible to make out a shape of the object behind the light. There was no sound.  I consider myself a competent sky observer, having a pretty good knowledge of aircraft and the night skies. I'm 44 years of age and this is the first and only time I have ever observed a light in the sky that I could not explain to my satisfaction. This event happened earlier this year in February and apologize for submitting this late, but I thought it worthwhile. At the time of this sighting, I did in fact check the online submitted UFO reports and local newspaper to see if this strange light had been reported by anyone else here in Sarasota area, but I did not find anything.

It got very bright  A few minutes later. The dog and I were diagonally across from our house.  All of a sudden many transparent green balls of light shot out and drifted down from the bright light very slowly  dissipating well before it came in contact with a tree line.  The bright light in back of the clouds disappeared and I returned home describing what I saw to my wife when she told me the cape cod times had many reports of sightings that week.  I will never forget these few moments.

I think this happened in or about 1957.  I was a child, sleeping in a sleeping bag in the back yard, and I think it was in the summer, when nights are warmer. I'd often seen red lights, seemingly the size of stars, floating in the sky, but they'd be blinking, which I'd been told meant that these were airplanes – and sometimes, I recall, I'd see a solid white light and a red flashing light in close proximity and moving in close conjunction – also airplanes, I think. However, this time I saw an UNBLINKING red light and a white light that weren't in conjunction at first.  One of the lights -- I think it was the red light – that looked just like a red star – was moving silently, perhaps more or less in a northerleasterly direction.  It approached what looked just like a stationary white star, and then seemed to hit the ""white star,"" which then moved in more or less the same direction that the red ""star"" had been taking, but off at a bit of an angle.  The red ""star"" kept moving, and may have continued in its course without altering its direction of travel. In any case, both ""stars"" silently kept on -- until they were out of sight, I think. They really seemed to be stars to me at the time, though I don't know how this could be the case. An unclear thing in terms of my memory is that it could have been the ""white star"" that ""hit"" the ""red star,"" but I think it was as I mentioned above: that the ""red star"" ""hit"" the ""white star.""

It was completely silent.  If we hadn't seen it with our eyes, we wouldn't have known it was there.  Just as it glided over I watched it as it went to the north towards Billing, Montana (about 90 miles north).  As I turned to watch it go, I saw another one coming in almost the same trajectory.  It looked the same size, no noise and was headed up north like the last one.  And as I started to watch it, here came another one from the same direction.  All in all, it was about a minute for them to all come, one at a time, and go north.  I quickly ran in the house, recorded the sighting on a piece of paper and drew the trajectory of the 3 fire balls on a paper. I worked for the State of Wyoming as a departmental secretary.

I am now in my 60's so it would put my age round 9 or 10 yrs old when this happened and can remember this like it happened yesterday.  I will never for get it. I was living in Opa Locka, Florida, at the time, with my two adult sisters. They asked me to please help them by taking the clothes off the line out side before it got dark, so I was in the process of doing that chore. When I felt an odd feeling come over me.  As though some one was behind me, and I could feel some sort of heat or some thing. As I turned around to look, I saw this object hoovering over top of the pine trees across the street from our house.  I do not know how to judge the distance but I can tell you it was close enough for me to see in side. It had a clear shield or was ""all clear"" at first. Blended with the clouds.  Then I could see an out line of some kind of metal.  I thought it was a blimp maybe at first, due its shape, but there was not sound and it was not moving like a blimp at all.  As it materialized It was not a blimp shaped but more like a thin sphere.  Oval like, and what metal I could see was shiny bright. I could see a figure inside which appeared to be a slender male, I could not see the face, or, I just do not remember.  Maybe a am just assuming it is a male figure. It was either standing or sitting by a control panel of some sort.  I could see tiny lights blinking. The figure was moving its arms as if it was working some kind of controls or some thing.  And was watching me, looking right at me, then looking down at some thing. It was all grey, or had grey like a uniform,(?) with grey military style cap, flat at the top with duck bill. I do not remember any symbols on any of the clothing.  But I do remember the back ground lights on the inside of the craft.  They were diff colors and twinkling. I began to feel strangely and I became paralyzed like, numb feeling all over.  I could not move at all, nor could I cry out. I felt some kind of pressure on my body like a vibration maybe, and heard a low humm....could see some thing around the craft like it distorted the air around it maybe.  After that I dont remember any thing. The next thing I know. I was walking into the house with out the clothes basket, and my sisters were angry with me.  They had been looking for me for over an hour or so. I told them I was out side in the back yard, taking down the clothes, but they said NO I was not, and wanted to know where I went, because they went all over the neighborhood looking for me, as well as a neighbor.  I could not answer their questions, but I tried to explain the weird craft I saw, but they did not believe me.  They wanted to know where I went, but I just did not know, so they thought I made up a story to cover my butt.  And I was grounded for few days  HAH!  To this day I cant remember where I went, or what happened, but I can remember the incident like it was yesterday, and have had strange experiences all my life from that point on.  Strange dreams etc...being appearing... Some type of sleep paralyses that occur when a male figure appears in my room, like a shadow, wearing long black cape and a large brim hat, among other things that have occurred. Out of all the UFO photographs I have not seen one such as the one I saw.  Or maybe I just cant remember all the details. Then in the year 2005, in north Fla, I saw a strange light in the sky above our apt. I thought it was plane head lights, but it would have been to low to be a plane. The beam of light was triangle in shape, an  then a huge owl appeared out of no where,  flying in front of the light, in the light, looking down right at me, and sounded off with a loud screech, hoovering above me.  I was not frightened, but excited.  My son and daughter were with at the time, so they saw it too.  The light lased for about 1/2 hour or so. A few days later I had a dream that me, my son and daughter, were coming out of the apt, when I noticed a huge round light that at first I thought was a full moon on the rise.  But then I looked to my left and saw the moon. I said to my children, since when do we have to moons.?  Instantly, the light changed into a sphere, of some sort of strange metal that looked almost lead in color, smooth with strange design.like where widows might have been, but no glass.  Just shapes like beveled windows.  I can draw it plain as day. Any ways... It began to shine a light from the center of the round sphere, which started off to be like a blue light and turning to a very bright white light with intensity, till you could see nothing but the light. Then it swooped away into the sky with great speed,leaving a cinder like trail.  Reminded me of a sparkler.  Then as quickly as it speed off, it came back, and flashed a very bright light, that was very hot, at me, my son and daughter but they dont remember any thing at all, other than the light and owl incident.  But any ways that light was so bright that we had to turn away from it and cover our eyes.  If it was a dream or reality they cant remember any thing but the owl and light. I dont know what all is going on, but I can tell you that I know, what I know, and what has been occurring in my life is real, with out any doubts. I watch the heavens all the time wondering about it all. These are just a few incidences I am sharing with you, because they are the most memorable in my mind. Fresh as yesterday. Have these things been Alien encounters due to their nature?  Do you know of any one having similar experiences?  Has any one ever seen a UFO that is similar to what I have seen, or the strange shadow man in the night?   It bothers me that I have no answers for even my self, and cant afford hypnotism, much less afraid of the ridicule. What I have just shared with you is to my knowledge true to the facts presented. It is my hopes that some one will read this and share their similarities if any. Or some one can help me figure out what the heck is going on. I do not have photos nor did any one else see what occurred. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",,,

In the 70s, he worked as a police officer in the capital city of Montpelier. 	Just after dark in the fall of the mid-70s, my grandfather was on Interstate 89 on his way from Montpelier to Burlington. As a cop, he knew just about every major project in that relatively small and unpopulated state, so he was surprised to see some sort of construction project on the side of a small mountain. 	He could make out a huge dark shape (which at the time he presumed was a small mountain) covered in bright lights, slightly obscured by the unusually hazy air (considering the time of year.)  Since it was October and the Vermont ski season was fast approaching, my grandfather believed it was construction of a new ski resort. He pulled over next to around a half dozen other motorists who were trying to see what was going on but he couldn’t figure out exactly what it was.  It did not make any noises louder than those coming from the highway behind him. 	The next day, on his way back to Montpelier, he pulled over at the same milepost so that he could get a glimpse of it, but to his surprise, there was nothing there.  He looked around, and was able to locate where he stopped the night before, but this time, the “mountain” had vanished, and there was no sign of it anywhere.  To this day, he claims that what he saw that night was a massive UFO that had landed among the Vermont countryside. 	I have noticed that it is an option to be contacted by an investigator.  While I did not check the box, I would be willing to chat with one if they have any questions or think my report is of any significance.  If so, my email is in the contact info (which I would like to be kept private.) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Witness Account of Unidentified Flying Object:    Location:  Williams Lake, BC South Lakeside Juniper Street Google Earth lats/longs N52 06 30.47, W122 05 28.72     Date:  1977 Late September   Time:  Approximately 7:00 pm    Weather: Clear, high pressure with no clouds Crisp and fresh in the mornings, warm and pleasant in the evenings  Incident:  I was 15 years old and living with my parents on a 5 acre lot at the east end of Juniper Street on South Lakeside, which is located on the south shore of Williams Lake itself.  It is a somewhat rural subdivision outside of down-town Williams Lake.  Our house was located at the base of a large ridge that put us in early shade when the sun gets low on the horizon. The house was heated electrically, but we augmented this by burning wood in a big wood stove during the winter.  My dad and I would go hunting on the weekends and usually we would come home with a load of wood for the stove.  One of my chores during the week was to split and stack this wood.  I would sometimes tackle this chore right after school, but more often, it wasn’t until after dinner when I would find the appropriate motivation required to get started. It was one very typical evening splitting wood when I saw something that to this day, I cannot explain.  It wasn’t so much what it looked like, but rather what it did that has me perplexed.  I am without an explanation and 30 something yrs later, still wondering what that was that I saw. On this one particular day, things started out no differently.  I had finished up dinner and had gone outside to put a dent in the huge pile of Douglas Fir rounds that had been brought home the previous weekend.  As far as chores go, splitting and stacking wood can be fairly monotonous.  I often took the opportunity to take short little breaks during the couple of hours I would spend swinging the heavy splitting maul. During these breaks I would do things like asses the pile that I had split; ponder how much was left to do; maybe throw a stick for the dog a few times.  Several times during the previous weeks, I had taken the time to notice the passing of a commercial jet liner. The passing of this jet had become somewhat predictable.  At approximately the same time on certain days, it would pass directly over our house traveling roughly north to south.  Presumably, it was travelling from Prince George to Vancouver, but I can’t be sure. So there I was, splitting wood and right on queue came the jet.  Upon hearing the distant roar of jet engine engines, I took the opportunity to take a quick break and watched the passing plane for several seconds.  I remember that it was shinning fairly brightly in the sunlight.  From where I was located, the sun had set behind the ridge.  I was, as was all of South Lakeside, in the shadow of the ridge and it was turning to twilight.  The plane however was high enough that it was still in full sunlight.  It shone brightly and was easy to see.  It was leaving a long thin vapour trail that was marking the progress across the sky.  The vapour trail wasn’t lasting very long that day and had evaporated into nothing shortly after the plane had passed. The jet had disappeared over the horizon and the vapour trail had faded into oblivion, so I went back to splitting and stacking wood.  After working for what seemed to be about 10-15 minutes, I took another short break.  I don’t know why, or what made me do it, but I looked up toward the sky. As I glanced up, a movement caught my eye.  I noticed that an object was moving across the sky in a straight and constant trajectory originating from the east.  I say “object” because it immediately struck me as odd.  It didn’t look right.  It was something I didn’t recognize. The object was shining brightly in the sky, not like a light, but more so like a metallic object reflecting sunlight.  It wasn’t pulsing, or blinking, or flashing.  It reminded me a bit of a satellite in space.  You know..... those pinpoints of reflected sunlight that transect the sky at night, but this was different.  It was much, much larger than any satellite I ever saw.  It was too early in the day and not dark enough to see satellites anyway.  It also looked to be bigger even than the jet that passed by earlier. It was moving far faster than a satellite usually moves across the night sky, and also faster than a jet liner would travel.  It looked to be very high in the atmosphere and I couldn’t discern any specific shape to it.  There was no vapour trail or any jet engine noise at all.  It was completely silent. It captured my full attention as I couldn’t identify it.  I quickly thought in my mind all the possible things that I thought it could be.  A plane, a satellite, a meteor, a weather balloon, but nothing seemed to match what I was looking at. I was absolutely transfixed and focussed on this object and as I intently watched, it did something I can’t explain.  At the point roughly were the object intersected the path of the jet liner, it changed its direction of travel.  I say roughly because the vapour trail from the jet had long since completely dissipated.  I am not even sure it was at the same elevation as the jet was at, but it did turn from a heading of roughly west and onto what seemed to be the same south heading of the jet.  It looked like it had changed course to follow the jet. The manner in which it changed direction however is not possible.  It made a 90 degree turn at full speed.  There was no banking, no slowing down first, no gentle curves involved.  It was a harsh and exact 90 degree change of course.  It was heading west, and then it was heading south, faster than a blink of an eye. I can use a hockey analogy to help describe what I saw.  If you have ever watched a game of hockey, you will have no doubt witnessed the “One Timer” slap shot.  This is where a player passes the puck across the ice to another player who, without stopping the puck, and with a fair bit of skill and timing, hits the puck very fast towards the net with his stick.  That change in direction of the puck is akin to the change in direction of the object I observed. That is not all.  The object then started to accelerate.  From the point that it changed direction, it started to increase its speed, and I mean fast.  It didn’t become a blur, it was faster than that.  Shortly after the change in direction, it accelerated to the point where it disappeared completely, almost like it had achieved the speed of light.  It was gone.  The whole incident lasted a minute, maybe two. The next day, while waiting at the bus stop, I met my friend.  He immediately asked if I had seen an object in the sky the night before.  I said I had and as we excitedly exchanged accounts of what we saw, it became clear that we both had witnessed the very same thing. I never saw that object again and to this day, I have never witnessed anything like that thing in the sky.  What I saw was impossible, even with today’s technology.   Objects in motion simply cannot maneuver in the manner that I observed.  What on earth was that?  I don’t believe in “beings from another planet” visiting earth.  It doesn’t make sense to me.  The universe is huge, how could they even find us?  Why would they want too?  If they had developed interstellar space travel, which is a stretch to think that it is even possible, wouldn’t there be better places to go?  Most of all...why would they go to Williams Lake and follow a plane?  There must be a rational explanation to what I saw, but what is it?  I am still looking for an explanation..... anything to help me understand what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

We was walking through the park to gain access to the back gardens to steal garden ware. We got to about half way through the park and climbed a 6ft fence into a back garden when i had a strange feeling like someone was watching us.  We climbed onto the fence to go back on ourselves  i jumped down to the floor back into the park but whilst i was in mid air there was a huge bright fireball hovering above the trees with no sound. We walked up to the trees curiously wondering what it was i had just seen, we got to the trees and as we was looking up at the object it looked asif it was on fire. everything that was around this object was all orange from the reflection. We then turned around to head back to the path we came off to get out of the park, Still watching our backs from the thing that we just witnessed. From the corner of my eye i noticed a white chalk luminous human figured shape on the ground following us from behind the trees. this was moving incredibly fast without making a sound i then said to my cousin 'did you just see that'  he said  'yes what is it' i was then fascinated to what this was, so we decided to run and do a dead stop so see if it was following us. after several  times of doing this we seen it but still didnt know what it was so we decided to draw it out into the open. For the next half hour we kept running and coming to dead stop untill it was in the open, as the gaps between the trees got bigger we could actually see what this 'thing' looked like. this thing was chalk white luminous and moved incredibly fast,it had two arms, two legs and a head this looked like a human but had no features. when the sun was reflecting on its back you could see a blue outline inside the white chalk effect. This went on untill we got to about 100 yards to the exit of the park and decided to have one last stand to get a closer look at this.  As we turned around this thing was about 300 yards behind us, within a blink of an eye it was standing right infront of us in the open in broad daylight. what i then saw was chalk white, human figured without out any features. it then had white strobes appear out of nowhere and started spinning clockwise around it, i looked down at at mid waist of this thing and it was wearing some kind of device around it but this wasnt on top it was underneath its chalk appearance. what i called this thing it had on was a belt because i was around it waist but it had some kind of screen with black dots and dashes going from left to right in different orders. I then noticed the white strobes around this was moving faster then all of a sudden black strobes started moving anti clockwise on the inside of the white strobes.  this all lasted for a few minutes then suddenly i said to my cousin 'what is this' and then white strobes of the figure collapsed in spinning fast. this thing went backwards spinning towards the trees but wasnt spinning in a straight line is was zig zag then pausing in between zigzagging.  After it got back behind the first tree we decided to run towards this for one last look it had stopped spinning. It then poked what i though was its head out from behind the tree but it seemed as though it didnt care that it had been seen.  me and thing then looked directly at each other for the last time and i then felt really vulnerable so me and my cousin decided to run as fast as we could to get out of this park.  throughout this whole event there was no sound coming from the object above the trees and there was no sound coming from the figure itself it was silent but incredibly fast . We thought that we was tricking this figure with running and dead stopping but all along it tricked us. if this figure wanted to harm us it could of. this figure got within 3ft of us spinning in the middle of this park. i did not see this thing dissapear i was too busy running out the park. i was 15yr old when this happend now i am 43 yr old and i have never seen that kind of technology before or since this event happend. i have not spoke much about this to people because people wouldnt believe me if i said it. about a year after this had happend my cousin could not come to terms with what we had seen and had a breakdown and turned to heavy drug abuse after this noone would believe him when he told people and wasnt able to cope mentally. where as i was just so fascinated with what i got to see and know that there are other things on this planet apart from just humans and animals.

It proceeded to move ever so slowly horizontally through the sky.   14 or 15 seconds went by.  It then turned upward(?), with  the teardrop rounded end facing down.  Then, without even a flash it went straight up and disappeared.  It was out of sight in a second or two. Just gone. There was no sound.

It had a car-sized thin silver rectangular panel on top aimed eastward, angled up at about 45 degrees, shining brightly from sunshine. It ""hovered"" stationary a thousand or so feet over a long mountain ridge a thousand or so feet tall just a couple miles west of highway 95, around 30 to 45 miles north of Winnemucca Nevada, sometime around noon, on a clear hot dry windy summer day with unlimited visibility on a Sunday in August of 1985. I watched the target through a 7x monocular from northeast of it for about 5 minutes as a passenger in a van traveling south on highway 95 at about 60-70 mph, paralleling the mountain ridge. When we got as close to it as the highway was going to allow, I still could not identify what the object was even though I was seeing it clearly. Then, after having driven onward 2 or 3 more minutes southeast of the stationary object, it ""pixillated"" to total invisibility within 2 full seconds of gradually evaporating into thin air. My observation altogether included those several minutes approaching the closest point the highway got to the object and just a couple or few more minutes continuing past, thus allowing me to see it for quite a while from a wide span of angles before it faded into oblivion. My stomach sank as it started to pixillate. Inside me I growled ""don't you dare disappear before I figure you out""! Then the 2 seconds were up and it was completely gone. I said not a word out loud, however, and never once spoke to anyone of the incident for about 15 years. The 4 other adults in the van initially acknowledged the obvious black stationary target with shiny top panel in the clear blue cloudless sky, but without magnification they paid it little interest as they enjoyed laughter & conversation on our way home from an adventurous weekend on the last day of the Boise Idaho hot air balloon festival which we had just participated in. I haven't yet been able to nail down what exact date that was to the day. I was awake and sharp as ever during my sighting. I had been involved extensively in hot air ballooning for half a decade up till then and nearly a decade since, so have had my eye in the sky observing flying machines quite a bit. The bulky, big black crystal's rock-solid stationary stability during my 7 or more minutes total observation seemed impossible on such a windy day. Its disappearing act was especially confounding.

This was a very quiet, tree-lined, residential neighborhood consisting of mainly condominiums and apartments. That evening I did not hear nor see anyone on the street. I was walking along the sidewalk when quite unexpectedly, I noticed a glowing orange rounded object floating in mid air at an altitude of approximately 8 feet over the sidewalk, approximately 25 feet in front of me. I don't remember seeing from what direction the object came, I just remember it appearing there.  I continued to walk toward it as it slowly sailed horizontally in the air. It was floating very slowly, and I was able to walk up to it and observe it at a distance of 2-3 feet. The object at one point lost altitude and hovered at about at eye level. Now, it may have been floating in my direction from the moment I saw it, I don't recall ex! actly, I only remember that it floated just past the right side edge of the sidewalk over a patch of ice plant.  The size of the object was about 12 inches in diameter;  however, it was not perfectly spherical as the contour of the object appeared to fluctuate (slightly undulating)  I find it strange that my memory remains a bit weak concerning what happened next, and I have no recollection of events for the rest of the evening, but I believe that the glowing ball eventually drifted to the ground across from my feet and shrank in size (a bit like a dying flame) until it disappeared upon a patch of ice plant. At first, I thought that the glowing orb was a balloon with some kind of orange fire inside of it. I though that perhaps there were some kids nearby playing a trick on me. As the object came very close I realized that it wasn't a balloon. There seemed to be some kind of changing/moving luminescent source coming from within it.  I could not explain what I was seeing AT ALL. There were no kids around, and no sounds. I strongly remember thinking to myself that I had just witnessed something  supernatural and that I should not tell anybody about it. In fact, I did not tell anybody about it for many, many years. I was eighteen years old at the time. Characterizing the experience as a supernatural event was the only way I could explain it, yet my gut sense told me it was some kind of natural/geological phenomenon, perhaps simply because it was so real. I was a part-time freshman in college at the time, and had not yet taken any physics or chemistry classes that would have improved my observation skills or at least increased my frame of reference. Looking back, I think that what I witnessed was a ball of plasma (ionized gas).  I recently related the story of my experience to a professor of physics at my local community college. He was of the opinion that what I witnessed was a rare (and controversial) phenomenon known as ball lightening. A professor of chemistry at the same institution, a! fter hearing about my experience, theoretically rejected and argued against the very existence of ball lightening and offered no scientific explanation for the phenomenon I witnessed.

Late one night as I was 15 years of age a female friend and I were chasing one another on the equipment in a playground.  In the middle of our horse play a bright flash that was strong enough to blind us from all other sight was released.  The flash was quick and resulted with no sound and did not leave our vision impaired after it was through. This flash did disorientate me and I proceeded to stop and wonder, losing all track of my friend at that moment.  Not to long after the first flash followed another flash just like the first one before it. By this time I was looking all around to try to make quick sense of what was going on.  Finally I decided to look up towards the stars.  What I saw next froze my body into a very frightening but awe-struck pose. The best way I can describe it was a pattern of lights that had a soft glow to them, like an infrared light on a security camera you might see at an amusement park.  The lights were arranged in a circle, with another smaller circle of lights with in of different color and 2 to 3 more following with in all of different color. Only half of these lights were visible.  The circle dimmed as you looked towards the center (half circles).  Once the lights were seen towards the half way point of the circle they were less visible.  The other half of the circles of lights were not visible. The lights moved together as one although you can see every star in the sky between them.  The lights were proceeding west above our heads slowly, like a helicopter can and during the entire event not a sound was made. It happened quickly, but before the lights faded as it was moving, another flash just like the ones before was released. Just moments after this flash the lights faded quickly and were gone.  One more flash was released after the lights vanished. By this point I felt over whelmed and composed myself quickly and began to look for my friend. I found her staring up at the same place I was looking during the event.  She proceeded to look right at me and her face told me she saw it too.  I quickly asked her if she did see it.  Scared to death she nodded yes.  I told her then we should leave. Shaking and nervous, we hopped on our bicycles and started to go home when a Riverside County Sheriff raced by the park and flung his search light right on us.  He stopped and exited his patrol car very fast and approached us a little nervous himself and asked us with a strong voice what we were doing here.  Both of us were to frightened to answer him right away and he did detect this and proceeded to ask us calmly but fast if we saw anything.  We both nodded no.  Disappointed he told us strongly to go home and rushed back to his car and took off very fast. We went back home dazed and confused, talked briefly on what we saw and never spoke of it again.   20 years later I can not come up with one single ideal of what it was.  Only 4 factors that play in my mind is the Air Force Base not but 20 miles or so north from us at the time, my friend saw it with me, the officer saw something too if not just the flashes and people the next day speaking of the flashes.

It was 7PM and still very sunny and clear. We came out of the grocery store and got in the car. We were driving west down Guadalupe Rd. in Tempe, AZ. My mother gasped, leaned forward to look into the sky and pointed at something. I leaned forward too. We saw a silvery streaked object falling southwesterly at a 120° angle against the blue sky. It was leaving a small tail behind it but not falling as fast as a meteorite and much bigger and duller than a meteorite. My first thought was space debris or a missile. But then it stopped suddenly about 50° above the horizon. When that happened, the tail ended, the shape changed to spherical and the color went to a lustrous pearl color. It appeared to be over South Mountain, maybe 5 miles away.  My mom managed to drive home. A few minutes later, we drove into our parking lot, having never lost sight over the treeline. From the parking lot, I ran into the apartment to grab my binocs, at which point I informed my dad and sister that there was a UFO outside.  I ran back out, rejoining my mom. All four of us watched it.  The bottom had opened up into a “V” shape and it seemed like hot gases were coming out of the bottom, like the steam rising from car hoods in the summer. It was soundless. I was the only one who saw it through the binocs and when I looked, I saw little sparks flying off the pearly surface, which flew chaotically around the UFO and would fizzle out, as if composed of electricity.  I also saw more specifically clear-colored heat waves coming out of the “V” shape. The UFO hovered there while people on the street were calmly driving their cars past us. It seemed to hover in exactly the same place in the air while the Earth turned underneath it. Sunset approached and after thirty to forty minutes, it was getting further away and more back against the horizon.  It seemed to be over Estrella Mountain at this point.  It was going to disappear soon. The sun was already down below the horizon so we just turned and left at around 7:30 PM. We watched the news that night expecting it to make the news.  We were frustrated that it didn't. Certainly in a city the size of Phoenix, people are not that busy. I did write down all these details that very night and I called Luke Air Force Base, spoke with a secretary and asked her if anything strange was seen on the radar.  She was nonplussed about my UFO sighting.  I have since learned that on that day, there was a funeral procession for a fallen soldier at Luke Air Force Base at appr. 7PM and so somebody at the base must have seen it.  Personally, I think it was experimental unmanned aircraft out of the NASA testing facility south in Maricopa.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,33.414035671514114,-111.92091958939265

From the outset I had the feeling that what I saw was probably an experimental military aircraft of some sort – still a UFO (since it was flying and I couldn't identify it), but not necessarily alien or anything like that.  Pre-Apologies for missing some of the details below. Side note: I am an amateur astronomer, a licensed pilot, former military airborne, and former airline employee (currently a college professor).  I have lived and worked around aircraft (and the night sky) for decades. This was nothing like I've ever seen.  Here is the story:   A regular summer outing for me and my family is to climb up into the mountains northeast of Los Angeles for some quality time together with nature and each other.  We were camping at our usual spot (Serrano campground on the north shore of Big Bear Lake) in the San Bernardino mountains of Southern California.  One reason I enjoy this site so much is the altitude and clear skies make for some exceptional sky-watching. After turning in to our tents and sleeping bags one night, everything was quite, when in the middle of the night, about 2am, my two dogs started whimpering.  Thinking they just needed 'relief', I grudgingly opened my tent and walked out into a clearing with them.  The dogs did not do their usual sniffing around and marking every bush, but instead were acting kind of strange.  They both were standing perfectly still and looking up to the same point in the sky, near the eastern horizon.  I was puzzled at their behavior and when I followed their gaze up toward the east to try and see what they were staring at -all I saw was a beautiful star-filled sky (no moon).  I spent a moment or two enjoying the Milky Way and the stars wondering what had my dogs so captivated and was about to head back to the tent. Quite suddenly and unexpectedly a dark, triangular shaped object appeared from the east-northeast horizon and travelled at incredible speed from roughly east-northeast to west-southwest. It made not even the slightest sound - absolutely silent - both as it was approaching and as it was receding. It had no lights of any sort, certainly none of the typical aircraft lights I'm very accustomed to (navigation lights, anti-collision strobes, landing lights, etc.). This object was completely blacked-out. I also distinctly remember that it seemed to be wrapped in some sort of shimmering envelope - kind of like the wavy, transparent mirage you see above hot pavement in the desert.  What I thought especially perplexing was that this wavy envelope not only completely surrounded the aircraft – but equidistant was even IN FRONT of the craft - something that seemed highly illogical to me (as opposed to say what one might expect to see with sound waves or disturbed air behind the craft). There was no contrail/vapor trail, exhaust, or any other trace of its passing.  I saw no burners or engine nacelles, no indication of a propulsion mechanism of any kind.  Truthfully -I'm not even sure of its exact shape - I only say triangular because in the few seconds I saw it that was the only shape that I related with at the time.  That and the slight distortion made by the refractive envelope around the craft made it indistinct. Since I was already standing at about 7,000' elevation, I estimate the craft was flying at an altitude of approximately 15,000' –about a mile or so above me and perhaps a few miles diagonally north of my position.  It seemed to be about the size of a typical commercial/military aircraft (not especially large), though my visual judgment may be substantially in error in this regard –after all it was a dark object on a dark background. The thing that was most amazing to me about the entire experience was the incredible speed this craft exhibited.  This object went in a straight line from horizon to horizon in just a few seconds.  Almost as fast as I can swing my head from one side to the other.  Unlike any aircraft I’ve ever seen (and I’ve seen many) this thing zipped across the sky at meteoric velocity.  Further, I was dumbstruck at the complete lack of sound.  No engine noise, no sonic boom, nothing.  Not the slightest sound of any kind.  And this was in the dead of the night –up in the mountains – on a very calm, quiet evening.  Even when out with my telescope (I regularly use a Meade ETX125 outdoors) or binoculars, I frequently see even very high-flying aircraft – which always leave a faint sound signature as they pass.  This craft was not very high at all and made not a sound. My first thought was UFO.  But I rapidly changed my mind and am fairly confident (though I have no way of confirming this) that this was in fact some type of experimental or 'black project' craft.  My reasons for this are as follows:  The sprawling Edwards AFB which is only about 50 miles to the northwest of my position (and China Lake not much further – and Groom Lake in Nevada not all that much further northeast, among others) – are all now all but notorious for their experimental aircraft testing.  My proximity and viewing angle that evening put me in prime time/place for making a sighting of one of these aircraft if in fact that is what it was. Also – having been in the aircraft industry for so long, I was already aware of some of the experimental aircraft discussed in the literature, etc.  Lockheed Martin’s “Skunk Works” and Boeing’s “Phantom Works” are all nearby – they have to test these craft somewhere.  When I did some research I thought that the closest possible craft looked similar to the TR3B and similar triangular-shaped vehicles speculated to be in testing both then and now.  I cannot make a close-enough identification, however, as the craft I saw was highly distorted, and traveling at much too high of a speed to get a very good look at it.   It is possible, I admit – that I may be entirely mistaken and saw something else entirely. In any case, as I stood there in my underwear shaking and stunned (it was also a chilly evening!), my mind raced to compare what I saw to anything in my experience and, well, you've heard the rest. No running or nav lights of any sort, pitch black, surrounded by a weird shimmering envelope, absolutely silent, and by far the fastest moving object I've ever seen - I can't imagine anything moving that quickly from horizon to horizon - and I've seen a lot of airplanes - from strike fighters to commercial and a few odd ones at e.g., the EAA, etc. This was definitely different, and certainly NOT following a whole bunch of the 'rules' I was used to regarding aircraft operations. So me and my 2 German Shepherds went back to bed in the tent, and the next morning, still shaken, I (hesitatingly) relayed the encounter to a few folks. The response was a collection of strange looks, doubts, sighing-giggles, and a bunch of ""sure-whatever”.  As may be typical with such observers, I felt such unsympathetic, near-ridicule from my friends and family was all the motivation I needed to keep silent and never mention it again.  All I could think of was how transparent such experiences are in revealing what others may think –and I instantly understood why pilots and other professionals are advised to never report or mention anything about such anomalies they may encounter.  Like most of them, I suppose, I thus kept silent about it after that. What changed my mind?  I was up at Serrano campground recently and recalled the incident.  I was fumbling with a little AM portable radio and stumbled upon Peter Davenport speaking on Coast-to-coast radio show.  It seemed just a coincidence, but Mr. Davenport was imploring listeners to file a written report, with lots of emphasis on making a clear, detailed, written report on the UFO Center website.  I thought, “OK, Mr. Davenport – you’ll get my report”. So, my apologies in advance for waiting nearly twenty years to pass this on to someone/somewhere.  And, like most aviation and academic professionals, I must admit I am instantly nervous for doing so.  Yet, I figure that if all of us always kept silent, then the truth would never be discovered, and that such silence would be of greater detriment to all of us than my silence a potential benefit to me alone. Thank you and good luck to you and your organization… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2013-08-30T00:00:00,34.2395,-116.8685

All of a sudden, unmistakenly and very vividly, at about a 10 o’clock angle, I noticed two very bright white lights take off from the ground, one right after the other.  The time frame from the moment they left the ground to where they disappeared going straight up at the top of the sky was about 2 or 3 seconds. The way I recalled the description was like this:  there was a light within a light.  The outside white light was fairly round, but was spread out/diffused around its perimeter, making it translucent.  The light in the center was more solid, more opaque, as if that was the craft and the light around it was maybe its power source, or a result of its power being emanated from the craft. Later, I realized that that location where it emanated from was probably Vandenberg Air Force Base.  My instinct at the time told me that perhaps our military was working with the aliens and allowing them to use their base to land and take off when they wished. However, as time passed closer to the present, having learned how much technology that we’ve reversed engineered from the aliens, or, even technology I’ve read about from Tesla and a fascinating interview with Ralph Ring, who worked with Otis Carr, protégé of Tesla, I’m more inclined to think that what I saw was our own “UFO” technology at work. Has anyone else reported on this siting back then or any other time?  Thank you.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

I was sitting behind my dad, who was driving. It was late at night, probably around 11pm. I had the strangest feeling that I was being watched... I turned and looked to my left, towards the mountain-side, less than a second later, a large round globe lit up, red and orange. There were no lights on it, just a solid glow. Light did not reflect off of other objects around it like trees, rocks, or shrubs. It seemed to immediately shield or barrier itself with something that seemed ""electrical"". No more that a second later, it ""catapulted"" off the ground incredibly fast, into the sky. It was going away from me, leaving a small white trail. It seemed like it stayed pretty close to the ground, like it wasn't going very far. The whole thing happened in less than 4 seconds while we were driving! by. 	 I was the only one in my family who had witnessed this event. A few years later, I mentioned this experience with my dad. He told me that he has seen a couple of red/orange globes flying in the same area. He saw them on two separate occasions. Each time, the were floating within the valley at night, between the mountains. They were described to be about the same size as the one I saw, but they were going slower, maybe a couple hundred miles an hour. They float around then shoot off, out of sight. 	These events happened on Hwy 49 in California, between the town of Coulterville and the Bagby Recreation Area.  These are my best estimates of my experience; the object was about 200ft round,  about 300 ft behind the edge of the mountain-side closest to the road.  If we stopped the car and climbed to where it was, it probably would have been less than half a mile away.  I couldn't say if the object made any sounds or not, but it was very graceful.  It looked like it took off quietly. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate.  PD))",2013-08-30T00:00:00,37.7163,-120.1287

It was around 12am and a few clouds where in the sky. We went to the 2nd floor balcony.  We looked up in the sky and saw a blinking light.  At first we thought maybe it was the space shuttle or the space station. We knew it was not any type of aircraft it was to far up to be anything other than a planet or something else.  We continued to watch it for a few minutes trying to figure out what it was.  When we looked over the bay there was a light cloud bank at the time.  Clouds were blocking out the moon light so it was sporadic at times.  And there it was the clouds moved out and the moon light hit a large circular object.  It had a dome on top and below the dome appeared to be what looked like some sort of exhaust ports.  Could not tell what was underneath other than something was protruding from there.  It couldn’t have been more than 100yds from us. You could actually see how smooth the service.  It lasted maybe 30 se! conds the clouds rolled back in and it was gone.  And while this was going on the light was still blinking in the sky and when the object left the light stopped at the same time.  We went inside thinking what the hell just happened.  Neither of us could sleep and ended up staying up most of the night.,2013-08-30T00:00:00,29.274632307692304,-94.82867435897437

We both noticed an object flipping/moving through the grass in a random manner.   The object was black and reflected absolutely no light.  It appeared at first to be boomerang or V-shaped   but after watching it approach us it was clearly two 3ft scalene triangles attached or jointed at the shortest side - as though a boomerang had been folded down the middle and was then flipping and moving on the points through the tall grass.   it also appeared to be changing in dimensions as it flipped, coupled with the lack of any reflection it was difficult to comprehend.

Just one that made  you know it was there.  Powerful.  It made me palse the TV.  And seriously wonder what it was. Also, I didn't mention, but still remember, how it blacked out the stars in the background.  It was black. I couldn't see a star but the the lights.  Not until it left from me a little ways. P.s. I clicked possible abduction bc about a year ago I had a dream. I was in Oklahoma.  On Idaho street where my dad and I lived, where I saw the lights.  It was night time and I could feel that sound, the I was lifted up off the ground suspended for a time. Then snatched backwards at an angle into the sky.  I awoke panicked.  So maybe it was a dream.

I don't remember the date, or year, but it was a nice clear sunny day several years back.  I was traveling east on the bridge over the 5 and 1 dam, and was stopped at the 1st stop light on the viaduct, which goes over the Cedar River, under interstate I-380, for a red light.  I looked over towards the Quaker Oats factory, and I saw something over the river, with the sun hitting it, and glinting off of the surface, which had to be metal, because of the bright reflection of sunlight bouncing off of it.  The light obscured the exact shape of the object, but I assumed it had some type of flat surfaces, although it appeared to be in a round or oval general shape, because at first I thought it was a balloon.  But the way the sun reflected off of it, and the fact that the glinting moved slightly-like the object tilted here and there, slightly, while staying in the same place, led me to believe it had some angular sides, culminating in a geometrical round or oval s! hape.  I knew it was not a balloon, because it stayed in the exact same place, and the only movement was this slight tilting around that I only knew of because of the sun glint moving around like off of flat surfaces that are tilting around randomly, but only slightly.   It may have been several hundred feet or more, away from me, and several hundred feet or more, above the river.  It was not a balloon, plane, or helicopter.  I looked around to see if any other drivers saw it, but they were looking straight ahead, when the shape was off to our left, plus I think the interstate overpass above us blocked their view, but I could see it because I was on the left hand side in the left lane (a one-way).  When the light changed, I circled around the 1st chance I got, but the shape was gone.  It seems similar to the post where someone saw something on 4-17-2008, because of the reflection, and that it was staying in one spot.  My mind could not and can not make sense of what it was, as I have never seen anything like it before of after. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The lights were white and moved together, slowly, toward the south. Further south, there was a single point of light that appeared to be a separate object.  That light was larger and brighter.  Briefly, a large flare (also white) seemed to follow the object. Although the flare implied speed, as if it were a tail of a comet, the object appeared to be moving slowly. The flare went away after a few seconds.  The objects slowly faded away as I watched them. They remained white and slow moving.  I attempted to shoot a video with my iPhone.

I recently heard about the clusters of orange and red 'fire balls' being witnessed all over America and that people were invited to contact yourselves regarding these strange orbs of light. I am from Scotland and myself came into close contact with one of these orbs of light around 5 or 6 years ago.  I will go into as much detail as I can as I feel it is better that I tell the entire story of what happened. Let me just first say that these orbs of light are NOT Chinese lanterns which many people claim them to be.  And I will now go on to tell you how I know this as a fact. It was night time and I was alone in my bedroom one night around 5 to 6 years ago now, and I was listening to music on my computer.  At this time I was becoming a more spiritual person and was trying to listen to the music in a more spiritual, prayer type of way.  The best way for me to describe this was that I was focussing on my own internal energy, or soul, whatever you want to call it.  After a while of doing this type of meditation I crossed my room to turn my light out.  I then turned around and began walking to my bed but was stopped in my tracks by an orange ball of light that suddenly just appeared in front of me just a few feet above my own height. I was terrified and couldn't take my eyes off of it.  It was about the size of a tennis ball. It was such a brilliant orange glow, but the glow wasn't emitting like it would from a light bulb, but it was completely within itself. I'm not sure how else to say this, but I knew it was looking at me.  I just felt it in my being that whatever this thing was, it was alive and watching me. After around maybe 15 to 20 seconds it just shot down past me at an incredible speed and went straight through my floor. For it to be perfectly still for that small period of time then fly down straight through my floor to  me means it had to make that decision to move from being still to flying at an amazing speed.  So if it made that decision then it had to be alive. I promise this story is real and that I didn't just imagine or dream it.  Ever since I have been fascinated by them and would love to know what they are and where they came from. Again I would just like to emphasise that these lights are not lanterns or even part of a bigger craft like structure, although some sightings at night may very well be, but for the majority of the light orbs being seen in the  sky I believe to be independent balls of light. Thanks, and I hope my experience in some way helps bring a little more clarity as to what these things might be. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

While watching the BBC breakfast news of terminal 5 opening on the 27th of March 2008  I saw a figure in a white space suit, it was for a second or 2 until the picture went blocky around the figures head area, so I did not see his head, then it went back to the studio and they said it was for technical reasons, I phoned the BBC to ask about it and the guy told me he would look at the film and to call back , which I did, he said he had seen it and what I had seen was there and it was extremely spooky, he said he had sent the clip to everyone at the BBC, so it was on film, I was so excited I forgot to ask him to send the film clip to me, since then I contacted the BBC  by mail but just got a circular standard response. I have thought about it ever since, in my opinion the space mans head area was disturbed by the camera filming and something on his helmet activated his invisible cloak and he became visible, which in turn disturbed the BBCs camera and the film went blocky, could someone look into it pleased; I think it is of major importance, the spaceman looked amazing and either he was nearer the camera than the presenter or he was about 8 ft tall, I have no idea if the presenter saw him!",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

It was dark, chilly, calm, and the sky was partially clear. I am an avid stargazer and am very familiar with the night sky in all seasons, and particularly with the night sky in this little valley.  We do have very dark skies here. So I was just surveying the sky, running through the visible constellations, when I noticed two pure white ""stars"" relatively low in the northwest, apparent magnitude of 2 or 3--about equivalent in brightness to the stars in the Big Dipper--and separated by less than 1/2 degree (less than the width of the full moon. At that point they looked completely star-like.  The puzzling aspect was that they should not have been there, as I knew from long experience that there were no bright stars in that region of the sky at that time of year.  A kind of inner ""alarm"" went off in me telling me to pay attention.  No sooner had I thought that than the white lights began to move toward the house at a fairly rapid clip. It took me a few seconds to believe my eyes and be convinced that these ""stars"" were actually moving. I quickly went back in the house and called my family out to see this. My mother and father, my adult daughter, and three of my teenage children came outside and we went into the front yard.  The lights were bigger, brighter, moving in tandem, and coming very close but no longer moving at high speed. I should note here that in late November in West Virginia, the nights are very quiet out here in the country. There are no insects, frogs or birds calling, and no man-made noise. The lights passed directly overhead and appeared to be fairly low, but the curious thing to me was that I could not discern the shape, or even if it was one craft or two.  All I could see were these two pure white lights.  When they were passing overhead they were separated by about 6-8 full moon widths (3-4 degrees).  I have to emphasize that on this perfectly quiet country night, there was absolutely no sound as these lights passed low and directly overhead.  They continued on in a straight line until they passed over the hill to the northeast and disappeared from view.  From the time the family got to the yard to the time whatever it was disappeared was probably about a minute. At this point, everyone had a sort of bemused expression and there was surprisingly little talking.  I remarked that whatever that was, it was perfectly silent, and everyone agreed. We all went back in the house, and resumed our holiday as though it had never happened, which in itself is rather remarkable.  A few months later my father and I were talking about something that reminded me of this UFO sighting and I mentioned it to him.  He did not remember it. As he was 80 years old, I put that down to an effect of age, but later I mentioned it to my 26 year old daughter who was also a witness to it, and her memory of it was also very vague. I seem to be the only one of us who has a clear memory of this sighting. That seems to me to be one of two significant aspects of this, the other being the fact that these lights were far off and utterly stationary until the precise moment I realized there was something unusual about them.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,38.8363,-80.9424

So  we decided to take a little road trip to Timothy Lake to check out the camp grounds  and when we got there  the  entrance was blocked by snow.  So we turned around and headed home.   Because it was already late and we were ready to go home and eat. when we got about 3-4  miles away from Timothy Lake we noticed that the road was more brightly lit than I should have been, and we didn't notice any street lights out there in the middle of nowhere like that.   So, I allowed down the car and looked out the windshield  toward and what I saw kind of startled me.  I  didn't expect to see a very bright light in the sky, and it seemed to be following the car.   So I stopped, and got out  of the car.  kept the engine running while my friend in the passenger seat got out  with me.  We did there and watched the light for maybe 10  seconds and dec! ided to get back in the car and go away from this place.  once back in the car I  shut my door and my friend went to shit his door and when he reached for it he suddenly stopped,  got back out of the car and shut the door.  then.......  when I  looked in the  back seat our other friend was outside  and I  couldn't remember seeing her or even hearing her get out. And I specifically remember looking at the time when we left Timothy  lake,  it was  exactly 1am.  But when I realized my friend wasnt in the back seat I  looked at  the  time again while telling both of my friends to get back in the car  abd it was 2:56am.. I honestly  don't know how it happened, or if we were there longer than I thought or i could have been driving extremely slow.  But exactly how I just said it, is exactly how and what happened to my knowledge.  after  my friends  stood outside for a moment they finally got back in the car and I  proceeded to drive away,  when I looked up through the windshield  ! again I  saw  the  same light, so I  began to drive faster to  try &  get away, but it seemed like it was chasin us. once I  got up to 80mph  the light slowly  started to  move higher and higher  and eventually  behind the  mountain &  .  until I  showed up to  there respective  homes  and said goodbye  they didn't say a  single word to me about that..

North Shore Oahu Ball of Fire.,North Shore Oahu,HI,2011-06-30T00:00:00,oval,3 minutes,"Occurred : 6/30/2011 00:00  (Entered as : 00/00/11 00:00) Reported: 8/23/2013 6:29:39 PM 18:29 Posted: 8/30/2013 Location: North Shore Oahu, HI Shape: Oval Duration:3 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101478.html,"North Shore Oahu Ball of Fire Aloha 	I wish to file a report of a sighting I personally witnessed.  This incident took place in the summer of 2011 on the island of Oahu Hawai’i.  The reason for the delay in submitting this report is that I was unaware of your reporting site and I was not a Coast to Coast listener until earlier this year. Even though I’m a Coast listener,  I hesitate to report because I believe most of what I hear on coast is a fabrication of the callers.  Most of these people are wack jobs in my opinion.  It was not until I heard the stories of “Fireballs” making 90 degree turns that the hairs on the back of my neck stood and I realized that I too am a wack job. 	As I mentioned above that it was the summer of 2011 on a Friday or Saturday night late possibly very early morning.  I was at the famous Sunset Beach with a couple of new acquaintances.  My job would take me to the North Shore of Oahu every Thursday night where I worked as an auditor.  Friday mornings was the beginning of my weekends for partying on the famous North Shore.  I slept in my vehicle at Sunset Beach as to be the first and last at the endless parties. 	On the night of the sighting it was late and I determined this because the only people for some time was myself, two others whom I met recently and a few party goers on Sunset Point toward the east of the beach down near the water.  The partiers had a bomb fire as did that location almost every night.  I and the other two people were standing on the walkway in front of my vehicle talking story.  I had been drinking beer as I did every weekend. I must have drank at least a six pack by that time.  This was not an uncommon amount of alcohol for me. I can drink large amount of beer without problems.  Anyway, I was speaking to one of the other two people in my company.  We were discussing the bomb fire at the point.  That’s when the third person in my company made a comment about the fire. I said to him “what do you think we are talking about?” He replied “No! Not that fire. That fire.” Pointing above and to our right. 	When I looked in the direction he was pointing;  I saw a ball of fire traveling toward us. It seemed only a few seconds before the ball of fire had passed directly in front of our location.  It was just above the beach between us and the water.  It seemed close enough to throw a rock and hit it.  It was maybe twenty yards above and in front of us.  It clearly was a ball of fire with flames moving around it’s circumference.  It was orangeish red. The ball of fire did not stop and seemed to be traveling about 30 mph.  When it was directly in front of us as if it were for our benefit; between us and the water over the beach it changed directions in a perfect 90 degree turn. IMPOSSIBLE; I thought.  It than seem to accelerate directly out to sea away from us.  It seemed that it was about five to eight seconds before it’s illumination was no longer seen. 	I and the two others were astonished by what we witnessed.  There was a lot of “did you see that?” as if one of us may have somehow missed something.  After only a few moments of discussion the two others had changed the subject and as for me, I was still searching the sky above the ocean for answers.  I then turned to them and said “How can that 90 degree turn be possible?”  	In the following months I continued my weekend ritual of parting at Sunset Beach.  I was cautious to avoid contact with the other two. I did not want to appear a freak to other frequent party goers of Sunset. Then months later I was in conversation with a couple of other persons.  The conversation was about objects that appear under water at night.  The person telling the story said that the light under water appeared florescent green.  That’s when another person listening interrupted and stated, “Wait to you see the balls of fire flying”.  I immediately blurted out “you’ve seen them too??”  My friend the person mentioning the flying ball of fire said “you spend enough time in the north shore, you will see them.  My friend has spent much of his 65 years on the North Shore of Oahu.  He claims to have seen them more than once. 	In the time since that incredible night on the North Shore; I have replayed it in my mind. I try to think in details cautious not to add unseen details. My first focus for some time was the 90 degree directional change. I was in the US Marines and had spent a lot of time flying in Helicopters and planes.   My father was in the US Air force and we live near base growing up. NEVER in the air, on land or sea can the direction change be possible whether at a stopped position or in movement as was the case that night.  I finally gave up on the direction change as I could not explain it.  I then moved on to who?  Or What?  I considered where I was and where it happened.  The Island of Oahu! This is key. The Island of Oahu is likely the most protected area in the world.  Sunset Beach on the North Shore of Oahu is only a few miles from the location where the Japanese came ashore back in December 7, 1941.  Oahu has in the north part of the island military training sites to include restric! ted areas just behind the hill line where we stood that night.  The Island has many military posts for the US Navy, Marines, Army, Air Force and Coast Guard.  I come to the conclusion that it must be us, as in the United States. Just east of Sunset Beach located on a hill top is two large round globe like buildings. They say it’s a radar station.  It’s in the direction the “fire ball” came.  If this fire ball was alien, then would not the radar station spotted it and one of the many fighter jets stationed within miles be in pursuit?  I had not seen no other object or plane in the sky that night. It must be us as in the United States. 	My most recent focus of detail that night is the fire ball itself.  The size seemed to be about twice that of a sports utility vehicle.  The color was as mentioned an orange ish red.  The shape was a perfect ball.  The texture was flames in motion around the entire surface.  That’s when I realized two important details.  These details defied logic as much as a 90 degree directional change. 	The flames the covered its entire circumference did not stretch behind the object like a tail when in motion.  The flames appeared tight to the shape of the ball and moving around it almost as if the fire was within the ball seeking a way of release to the outside.  I also recalled that it appear to illuminate the ocean’s surface below it as it made its way out to sea. I also noticed that the direction of travel was near dead North out to sea.  This was interesting because the Hawai’i Island chain north of Oahu continues with Kauai to the Northwest of Oahu.  The next Island after being even further toward west and so on.  Where was this ball of fire traveling to?  The direction was an indication that its destination was not a nearby Island. 	In addition I recalled that it made no sound.  We were within yards if not feet of it while it was in motion and no sound.  The area where the sighting took place was quite at that time of night.  Finally the last incredible detail recalled to this date is that the fire ball as big as two sports utility vehicles covered in flames close enough to hit with a rock produced no heat.  This detail probably would have been over looked by me if not for the fact I have been to a Nasa Shuttle launch.  The location I viewed Columbia’s launch was the nearest allowed. It was on the base located in Central Florida.  I was told our location at that launch was three miles from the pad.  The one thing most that stands out about that day at the Shuttle launch was the heat everyone felt when so far away.  I remember thinking that day that if the wind were stronger we would all be suffering from burns.  Unlike the shuttle, the fire ball was silent and without heat radiating from its flames.   Thanks for reading. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

I was outside my residence having a cigaret, as I was looking to the west towards this mountain that is very tall & was silhouetted by the moon that night, I noticed what I had seen, I just thought it was an airplane coming from Kelowna. Because I was living right by the airport at that time?  But as I continued to observe this object I thought that my eyes were playing tricks on me so I used the telephone pole & transmission lines to line the object up to see if in fact that what I was seeing, was in fact doing what my eyes were seeing. And once I realized that was the case I started hollering for my ex wife to come outside to bear witness to what I was seeing.  What it did was Absolutely Amazing! I tracked it on the pole for the vertical trajectory & along the cable and telephone wires for its horizontal trajectory. It first just hovered there then it went from the top of the pole down to the cable lines & stopped and then traveled along to the halfway point between the other telephone pole. It then stopped stayed there in hover mode for a min. Or two, & then went back along the same path as it used.  When it got to the pole it shot up the pole to the top of the pole and came to an abrupt stop.

I only recently learned of your site and, until now, had no idea there was such a place to file a report of this particular sighting. On July 30, 2011, my girlfriend and I decided to have dinner at a restaurant called La Luna Mexican Grill, located in Bethlehem, GA. It was a warm summer’s evening, with a perfectly clear night sky. This particular restaurant had rooftop dining, which we opted for on that particular evening. Bethlehem, GA is one of many small, lightly populated areas that are found all throughout Georgia. As a result, there was very little light pollution, allowing for an amazing view of the thousands – millions of stars overhead. We were about half way through our meal, enjoying some light-hearted conversation, when my girlfriend pointed up to the sky and asked, “do you see that light?” I looked towards the area of the sky that she was pointing towards, just in time to see a very bright light wink out. For the second that I saw it, it appeared to be an extremely large, very bright spotlight. “Oh my God,” she exclaimed, “what is THAT?” I continued looking in the same area of sky in which I had seen the light and, as my eyes adjusted from the candlelit table to the dark of the night sky, I realized what she was asking about.  Almost directly above us, there appeared to be an enormous, solid black object. It’s shape, defined by the area of stars that its massive form blocked out, was of a very long, very wide rectangle, with rounded ends. Much like the shape of a cigar, but broader. The object seemed to just hover in place as we both continued staring at it (about 2 minutes), at which point, my girlfriend then claimed to be able to see another, similar object floating next to the first. As my eyes frantically searched the night sky for the second object, my attention was drawn back to the first, as it suddenly shot away. Just like that, it was gone. Not a sound. No engine sound. No sound of propellers. Nothing. And, it was still completely black. No light shone from it at all. That was it. We spoke about the objects throughout the remainder of our dinner, and both agreed that what we saw was some sort of UFO. What neither of us could get over, and what my mind still struggles with today, was the sheer size of the object I saw. I have never seen an object as large as that in the sky. I’ve seen blimps, and I’ve seen some of the largest airplanes in the world, first hand. I can honestly say that nothing compares in the enormity of the object I saw that night. If I had to give a size to the object, the only thing my mind can come up with is to say that it must have been at least a mile or two in length. That size of an object had slipped away with such speed, and in complete silence, AND had hovered in one spot for I don’t know how long (no idea how long it had been there, before my girlfriend had originally noted its presence). It was amazing. The one question I can not answer is how high up the object was. My mind perceived it to have been a good distance up in the night sky. Perhaps somewhere between 5,000 to 10,000 feet up? It was hard for my untrained eye to tell, especially at night. Again, the night sky was perfectly clear. The temperature that night had been somewhere between 78-85 degrees Fahrenheit. There were only a few other people dining on the rooftop, in addition to us, and none of them seemed to have noticed our brief moment of excitement.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,33.9297,-83.7447

We were 5-10 minutes NW of Wayland, MI when we noticed an orange/amber fireball SE of our position.  I estimate its angle of elevation was 35-40 degrees.  It looked to be flying very slowly, if not hovering at times, over downtown Wayland.  Having seen similar things before, we decided to follow the aircraft.  The aircraft had been traveling S but started traveling SSE once we got closer.  When we reached our exit, we turned E.  The aircraft remained visible the entire time, save for a brief moment when it disappeared behind some trees on our horizon. Regaining sight of the aircraft, we turned into a parking lot facing N to observe. After a moment, we realized the aircraft was now heading due South and was going to fly directly over us. As we pulled into the parking lot, I estimate the aircrafts angle of elevation was 30-35 degrees and steadily declined until passing overhead. I'd say the aircraft remained under 150 yds in the air, at all times.  As the aircraft approached, the first things we noticed were two lights on its nose pointing forward.  That's to say, it had headlights very similar to a car. The aircraft also had 5-6 white lights on its underside.  The aircraft didn't have visible registration lettering, wings, propellers, a tail, cylindrical shapes, or navigation lights.  The aircraft was small, dark, and triangular.  It made a sound very similar to a jet, but was much quieter.  We didn’t see any afterburn. Even thought it was directly overhead, we were able to converse comfortably.  As the aircraft passed overhead, it was hard to discern the finer details of the body, perhaps from all the bright lights on its exterior. With the object now traveling away, we got in our car and headed for home.  The distance from where we witnessed the aircraft to our home is 5 minutes by car.  After 10-15 minutes of being home, we heard a sound very similar to what we had just heard, flying overhead.  We stepped out on the back porch and saw the aircraft fly directly over the house were in, traveling S.  The night continued without further incident.

Its angle of elevation was 55-60 degrees.  It remained there for about 10 seconds. In the next 5-10 seconds that followed, the object smoothly dropped very low to the ground, moved slightly NE (10-15 degrees N) and was now hovering directly above the road ahead. It dropped so low, I thought the object might land.  I estimate it's new angle of elevation was 15-20 degrees.  After dropping its altitude, I estimate the aircraft was hovering no higher than 100 yds. Gradually, during its descent, the object lost all of it's amber/orange glow and a small, triangular, flat black/primer colored aircraft became visible. The aircraft hovered above the road long enough for me to drive almost directly under it. I was extremely close to the aircraft, it was due South, and at one point was almost at my zenith. I had to maneuver my head out of the window to have a look. The aircraft didn't have registration lettering, wings, a tail, propellers, cylindrical shapes, or navigation lights. The aircraft was roughly shaped like a diamond, with a slightly elongated section facing West. There was a convex shape on the top of the craft, almost resembling a cock pit. The aircraft was virtually silent. I rolled down my window to have a listen and only heard the passing air. I viewed the aircraft at this distance for about 15-20 seconds before passing it by. I almost immediately looked back and looked in my rear view mirrors, but saw nothing. I reported this sighting to my local county sheriff's office as well as the FAA.

It was orange and stationary at first.   It seemed to respond to my thoughts.   As I focused on it, it grew larger and brighter apearing to stay stationary.  It apeared to be about the size of a full moon.  Then it grew dimmer and slowly moved to the east.   I started running into the field to get a better look and it moved faster.

What I saw that night was a circle shape that was reddish orange with a dull glow in the sky towards the east.  It almost looked like a large planet glowing low and far in the sky, but then I noticed it was moving slowly.  It could not have been an airliner because they have more than one light and usually have one blinking, and it clearly looked like a single large circle of light.  I wondered if it might be a satellite, but it was too large to qualify as one.  I was stumped.  I've never witnessed anything quite like it.

I watched for a few minutes and thought why is it just sitting there and it didn’t look like any plane I had seen before.  There was no sound like a plane.  There was no sound at all. I went out to the field that runs south along the side of the house so I could get a direct view of this object.  Once out there a second one moved vertically up from behind the tree line.   Now there are two of them sitting there.  Then, they started moving horizontally slowly back and forth, but they were not doing this in tandem.  They also moved slowly vertically, again not in tandem.   After about 3 hours one moved to the north again vertically and vanished behind the wood line and the other in the same fashion followed. I went back to the house but kept going outside looking up to see if whatever these were would show up and about fifteen minutes later I saw one coming directly overhead. This would be now moving in a western direction.  It stopped over the house.  It was now at a much higher elevation.  I watched it for about fifteen minutes and then went back in the house. I returned and it was gone so I went to the front of the house and there it was stationary in the front of the house. I decided to go back out to the field to see if the second orange ball might have returned to the place in the southwest where I had first seen these objects, but it was not there.  I was about to go back in the house when directly south two more orange orbs came up vertically from behind the tree line.  They were moving in the same fashion as the first two balls. And then they began to move horizontally to the south. All these objects were moving, not drifting.  It was about 11:30PM and I began to get a creepy feeling about these objects so I went back to the house.

When I came back to visit my mother at Christmas the orb at the front of the house was still there.

It is no longer there, so I don’t know what these objects might have been but they were like nothing I had ever seen before.

The wind was blowing out of the North and it was like when a bird faces into the wind and is able to just hold its wings out and kind of stay in one spot while riding the current of the wind. After about 30 seconds of noticing the object I realized that this thing was moving slowly but with no movement (wings flapping).  I looked over at object and to my big surprise it was not a bird but only what I could describe as a solid black walnut shape. It seemed to be so close, but is hard to say how far away from me it was.   I dropped the phone in amazement, not caring about the phone call no longer, knowing I wo! uld never witness this again. In fact, it was the weirdest feeling because my brain would not register what I was looking at. I watched this object fly into the Northeast direction, with absolutely no sound associated with the craft at all, until it dissappeared into the clouds. It stayed at the same speed the entire time of the observation, and since it moved across my vision from southwest to northeast, there were plenty of angles to tell that in did not have any wings.  I still to this day can not believe and will never forget this expereince, since it happened in broad daylight! I have seen plenty of odd acting lights in the sky over the years, knowing they were not of anything mankind has produced...at least publicly. From what I think the distance was from my position on the ground, the craft must have been around 25 to 50 feet in diameter.

Northbound, in between 8-9 o'clock from the direction of the rising sun in the area I spotted a bright orange light with the naked eye. At first I assumed it to be one of the bright Perseids fireballs, given the particular night.  However, it did not flicker out as expected and as it followed the normal trajectory of a meteor moving across the sky it slowed down and suddenly began to rise back into the sky.  It rose at a slightly faster pace than the one it had been falling at, and when it had traveled far enough (in between 10-11 o'clock from the direction of the rising sun) it stopped midair and hovered for about a minute and a half. Two aircraft right flew past it during that time, clearly identified as such by their blinking lights. The object itself also blinked, but not the way an airplane would - as it was entirely consumed in light its 'blinking' was more of a flicker, like a meteor. It was also completely silent; the only sounds heard were those of the two planes that passed it. Shortly afterward it began to shrink/dim in and seemingly disappeared out of existence.

We were sitting on an island campsite looking north at the night sky. It was a very dark and clear night, not a cloud in the sky, perfect for looking at the stars. As I was panning north, looking for shooting stars and satellites, something unusual caught my eye.  The first thing I noticed was this intense bright white light moving very erratically across the sky.  As I began to focus on the object and follow it’s movements, I noticed it was moving extremely fast, covering a wide distance and then stopping.  When the object would stop, a bright blue light shot out beneath it, which would last just a few seconds.   Then the object would take off it a different direction moving at incredible speeds and then stop again...then the blue light would shoot back down.   This continued for about ten minutes.   Up to this point I had not said a word to DD about what I had seen. I then called out to DD and said...”Are you seeing what I am seeing?”....DD replied, “YES!”   At this point we took out our binoculars and focused on the object.  It was a distance off...probably 2-3 miles away...hard to estimate exactly...but close enough that through the binoculars we could make out the shape.  It was shaped like a large bell or wedding cake.  Through the binoculars I could see pulsating lights across the middle of the object.  The lights were pulsating from left to right.  The color pattern was Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue.  The pattern was constant, continued at the same time internals. I then decided to grab a flash light that had a red laser pointer attached to it and shine it towards the object. While I was doing that, out of nowhere a second object appeared just off my left should moving East to West a few hundred feet above the tree tops.  It was the same intense bright white light.  It was close enough to get a good look at it’s shape...it was like a sideways tear drop.  It looked very smooth but the details of the outside were masked by the intense white light.   As it moved at a slow pace right in front of us, it made absolutely no sound. It kept it’s course for a bit longer just passing the northwest shore of Larch Lake and then all of a sudden took off at an incredible pace into the atmosphere.  Just before we lost view, it had changed from the bright white to bright red. The first object we had witnessed then took off in the same direction at the same pace...both out of sight and gone. It is in my opinion that what we witnessed two different types of UFOs.  I have no photographic evidence to support this eyewitness testimony.  It was a brilliant experience and will never forget what I witnessed that evening. I hope this isn't the last time!",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

On October 4, 2012 at about 6:45 AM in Bakersfield where I live I happened to be outside in my backyard and I saw way up high a ufo coming from the LA area headed north.  It looked just like a huge 'white ' PCP pipe (no protrusions like wings or nothing and flat in front and back) and it was just gliding along in a straight line.  I did not hear a noise but I estimate it's size, if it was on the ground, to be as big as a 747.  Well, I just stared at it until it was out of sight and then I went back in my house for a few minutes and went back outside in the backyard and here comes another one headed in the same direction, and then here comes another one headed south and they pass each other. Well I have been outside in the mornings many time since and then about two months ago I happened to see another one coming from the west and zipping through the clouds sort of south easterly direction but it was moving many times faster than the three I saw that day.  I just saw the last one for just an instant but it was the same as the others.  Haven't seen any since.  I was just wondering Mr Davenport, have you ever heard from anyone that said they saw that kind? Well, thank you for you time. Sincerely,  Cheryl Allen  ps.

Approximately 1 km South of the former US Clark AirForce Base, I was standing and facing east, smoking a cigarette and admiring the huge, extremely white, thick fluffy clouds hanging still, in the beautiful dark ocean-blue sky.  There was no noticeable wind, the temperature was warm in the mid 70's. I witnessed the under side of a saucer shaped UFO, color white as the cloud, slowly emerged out of the cloud into the blue sky in a Northernly direction and hovered motionless for 10 seconds but maintained a close proximity to the cloud and then returned into the cloud, no longer visible.  After 1 minute the UFO emerged out of the cloud for another 10 seconds and once again returned into the cloud. I was alone, had no camera. I believed it to be a UFO saucer shaped aircraft. One week prior to this, I witnessed in the early morning 6:00am, chem trails being laid down by a winged aircraft in the same area before it travelled far enough to lose sight of it.

My family and I were on a trip to the state of Western Australia in January this year (2013). We had driven for several days from Melbourne, and one of our stops was in a small town just over the border of Western Australia.  Later that evening at the camp site, just after 9pm,I was standing outside, a few meters away from our caravan where the rest of my family were asleep, with my phone using a star map to look at the constellations.  I remember it was a very clear night with no clouds, buildings or airports for kilometers.  On the star map, I was facing north east.  I was holding my phone above my head so I could track what was on the screen to what was in the sky.  I looked away from my phone, and in the sky directly above me, two rows consisting of about 3 blue, white and red coloured lights running parallel blinked in and out and moved across the sky in an easterly (left to right) direction until the lights morphed into only one row and flattened out to be ! horizontal, which spun and blinked in and out of view and then looked as though it did a hook turn and was coming straight for me before a tree blocked view and the object disappeared.It looked as though it got bigger when it was heading in my direction. It had been so real that I screamed and started crying.  I ran straight back to our caravan and woke up my parents.  It had been a solid shape because the outline had been clearly visible and the stars had been blocked.  It couldn’t have been an airplane because it was completely silent and completely disappeared from view. It was also to large to be an airplane,and also had too many lights.  My first thought in that moment of shock was that it had been some kid playing with a toy UFO, then it registered to me what I had just seen.  I’m not sure if there is any other explanation to what I saw, but I believe it had been a UFO.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

A bright white flash going east to west at about 75-80 degrees got my attention and then a few minutes later, a 2.5-3.0 inch diameter white light appeared in the lower right pane of the window, closest to where I sit at the computer.  The light seemed to be filtered, with a fuzzy or hazy perimeter.

As my husband approached the window and the green light, which was flashing in no discernable pattern, it moved away and down into the side yard.  My husband said it moved faster than anything he has ever seen.   My husband looked out the side window and watched as the green light moved back and forth and up and down but always away from the house.  My husband banged on the window but that did not affect the light's movements.

The light moved out of our view.  We observed the lights anywhere from 3-5 minutes. When inspected at daybreak, there was no obvious evidence. However, three of our tarps were affected.  Two tarps were off of the items they cover: a wood pile and a lawn mower.  The day on the night of the lights, my dad had secured the tarp over the wood pile with heavy wood planks; the day after the night of the lights, he noted that this tarp somehow had folded itself backwards in half onto itself displacing the weights.

It was about 9:00 pm central time. The sky was clear with visible stars and moon. The temperature was probably in the 30s. The moon was west and slightly south of the road. The object caught my attention due to its intense fire-like red/orange color. The upper edge of the object seemed to have a slight, vertical glare of color. My first thought was that something was on fire. I pulled over to the side of the road and turned off the engine with the window rolled down. The object was slightly south and closer to the ground than the moon, which was a very bright white. I realized that the object was not burning, as the color did not vary or flicker, and the shape of the object remained perfectly circular. I could not judge the height or distance of the object from my position. It appeared to be about the size of a penny held at arms length.  The object was stationary at first sight. After approximately one minute it began to move eastward. I grabbed my camera and took a shot. I checked the shot and noted that the shutter speed was too slow, resulting in a photo with motion blur and light trails. I changed the settings but by this time the object had moved further east and behind some trees, and appeared much smaller. It moved east past the trees and then just vanished.  The object made no sound. It moved in a steady direction without changing speed.  This was unlike any aircraft I've seen. There were no flashing lights, just a solid orb of color. We have fighter jets flying over from Omaha quite frequently, but they are extremely loud. I felt a great sense of amazement watching the object. I photograph landscapes frequently and am always looking at the sky for good light and clouds, but this was completely different than anything Ive ever observed.  The first photo shows the position of the object in relation to the moon. The second is an enlarged portion of the first photo showing just the object. All of the light trails are due to the motion of the camera. The object itself had no light trail at all.

Three buddies and I were riding on a UTV at 11 at night. I stopped and shut off the engine in the middle of a field to take in the night. I saw what looked like a satellite to the West and it was heading North. It traveled a small distance like a meteor, but slower, like a satellite. It disappeared like an Iridium Flare, but reappeared at a different elevation relative to the horizon. It traveled again like it had before, then disappeared again. The third, fourth, and fifth times it appeared it was going in different directions. First West, then Northeast, then down toward the horizon. I've never fully believed in ETs until that night. A few minutes after it quit, there were three aircraft with normal aircraft flashing lights headed east that were in a triangle shape, but with huge gaps in between them. These appeared to come from nowhere. Then the next night, 24 hours later at approximately 12:12 AM, I was driving home headed west when a bright light appeared from above for about a second and a half, not moving, then disappeared.  Both of these occurrences triggered a driveway chime in our house, that uses infrared to notify people coming through our driveway. My girlfriend was in the house at both times and said that was the exact time it went off. It would go off approximately at 11:39, 12:12, 12:39, and 1:08 sporadically. That week was the most active that it went off, and it slowly stopped ringing and now the driveway chime hasn't gone off for 2 weeks in the middle of the night.  The only other logical explanation I've been able to come up with is a high maneuverability aircraft that the government could be testing, and the lights we saw were the afterburners on the aircraft. However, I've never heard of an aircraft that can turn almost on a dime going what appeared to be several hundred miles per hour (300-400+), though it was difficult to tell at what distance it was.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,42.6987,-90.7202

It was hovering.  I didn't say anything to anyone else until I was completely clueless as to what and was and positive it wasn't attached to the ground.

First sighting (of two):  At 21:30 on May 31, 2013, driving south on Route 60 in Cassadaga, NY, I saw from the rear seat what appeared to be a tall tower of light.  I asked the others in the car ""What is that?  What are we looking at? It looks like a tower of light.""  The driver said ""There is no tower of light in that field.""  As we watched, the white lights seemed to be emerging from the earth or from Cassadaga Lake, 1,000 feet or so to our left (west).  There appeared to be dozens climbing vertically, one after another, at a relaxed speed.  When the craft reached an altitude of approx 500 feet, they leveled off and headed east.  They were traveling ahead of the car and, in a split second, I had to turn my head back to continue seeing them, now behind us.  I cannot say if there was missing time, but it was a strange sensation.  Each of these crafts had 2 or 4 very bright white lights and were climbing as if on an elevator, one after another.  At one point it appeared that the tower of light were falling over, but it was an optical illusion as they started leveling off and heading east.  They appeared to be moving fairly slowly and yet we observed them for only one minute or less and they had moved quite a bit in that brief space of time.  We could not see the body of the crafts, only the bright white lights.  Second sighting:  The driver had not slowed down, nor had he looked towards the lights, as the remaining 3 of us had. Within .25 miles, we made a right turn onto Dale Dr in Cassadaga ( now heading west).  As we turned, I was still looking above us at the night sky and saw more lights.  I called out ""Stop !"" ""Stop !!!"" and when the driver kept driving, I said ""Pull the car over !!""   We all got out of the car and stood under the lights, which appeared to be triangular.  The reason I say triangular is because each set of 3 lights vibrated slightly as they traveled east-south-east.  The vibrational movement was horizontal and each set of 3 lights moved as one.  We had missed several lights, but we watched 3 of these triangular-shaped craft flying in absolute silence, directly above us, at a speed of perhaps 30 mph.  A car stopped to ask if we were OK, we said ""yes"".  That car drove on.  A second car stopped and the man asked what we were looking at.  I said ""We're watching UFOs go by."" He said ""Thank God! I thought people would think I was crazy!""   He stopped his car and  then he and his mother stood with us watching the remaining craft go by. He had first seen the lights from his home and got in the car to get closer to the lights. As I observed the lights they appeared to be made of fire.  They were circular and under the crafts.  Others described what they saw as red lights, or yellow lights or orange lights.  The crafts were flying in a straight line formation.  After the 3 sets of 3 lights went by, there were 2 more crafts with single lights and they were not following the same straight line pattern, they were off to the sides. All of these craft, in the second sighting, were emitting a thick black smoke from the edges to camouflage the lights.  It looked like cloud material, only black. There were pictures taken with cell phones, with some blurred effects on one and with only 2 of the 3 lights showing on another.  It was difficult to estimate the altitude of the dark crafts, possibly 100 feet to 400 feet above us?   After the sightings:  The next day, June 1st, 2013, I was told of a woman who saw 30 lights in the sky around 21:30 on May 31, 2013.  I have since spoken to her and she told me that she saw them while sitting at her computer on her front porch.  She counted 30 lights, which were the same ones from our second sighting, but we caught the tail end and saw only 3 of at least 10 triangular craft traveling in a one line formation.  She was located slightly west-north-west of us at the time of her sighting.  Conclusion:  It would appear that at least the White Light crafts were emerging from Lake Cassadaga or very nearby and the possibility exists that the dark triangular-looking crafts may have emerged from the same location, at almost the same time. This area is a well-known vortex and Lake Cassadaga is known to be quite deep with some type of connecting spring system running beneath it. Was there a meeting occurring just before our sightings ? or is this a coincidence ?  My background:  I worked for a major Canadian airline for over 32 years, staring in 1973. I never witnessed any unexplained phenomena/ sightings in my career, although I heard of many sightings/experiences from pilots over those decades.  Backgrounds of the other witnesses:  The driver of the car is an accountant. One of the other ladies in the car is a nurse. The other woman works in mediation, if I'm not mistaken. The woman who saw 30 lights was a legal secretary for many decades.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,42.3424,-79.2831

What amazed me after 3 shots that i took, is that I didn't notice the object at that time.   It was a terrible weather that day of June 13, 2013.  We are expecting a powerful thunderstorm that day so i took a photo of the clouds forming just above the yacht. Powerful lightning was experienced that day cutting electricity 4-5 times all over 4-5villages.  It was not a plane nor a helicopter, it was totally different.  I tried to zoom the image and did some color changing just to figure out exactly the shape of the object using an enhancement application in the phone and i keep on having a dark shade beneath the object itself like a source of heat or something.   Some could argue that it's a clouds forming shapes which i thought it was but clouds cannot do a triangular shapes.  i do have a photo of clouds making a circular shapes but! triangular shapes with almost perfect straight line that is a bit ""impossible"".  The second object can also be seen at the far right of the photos and it appear from the first photo until the last and it appear to hover or move up and down base on the object different positions.

It remained in the same position and continued to produce an incredible light show.  It would have been in the same general direction as Marysville or Everett. It was hard to determine the diameter or exact shape of the orb as it appeared to be some distance away.  It could have been 20 to 50 miles away...if so, that would mean that it was quite large.

I face the Ottawa River not too far from Mud Island on the Ontario side.  My eye was caught by something in the dark night's sky across the river over Quebec.  I looked towards the object and it seemed to be a large orange object just hovering over the edge of the land just past Mud Island but across the river in Quebec. I watched the object (not sure if it was a circle or what but appeared so) and to my total shock all of a sudden an identical orange object, same size and shape, appeared very close to the first object.  It didn't fly there, it just appeared, as if it had turned on a light or just appeared out of nowhere.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  The 2 objects stayed in the same place.  About 10 seconds later I was stunned to witness a 3rd object, same size as the other 2, same color and shape appear next to the other 2 - same distance apart.  At that point I ran across the hall to get my neihgbour.  I was gone only maybe 1 minute but when I got back with her to show her the 3 objects 2 of them were gone and the 3rd one (the first I saw in the sky) was descending straight down towards the ground. Unfortunately there were clouds down low so the object went behind the cloud so I couldn't see how far down it went or if the other 2 were there as well - behind the clouds. My neighbour did witness the last half of the last object descend so she did see one as well.  As we stood there, not more than 15 seconds after the last object descended, we were stunned to witness something hitting the ground just off to the left of where the 3 objects once sat in the sky.  It appeared that perhaps these shots being fired might well have been coming out of the 3 objects in the sky.  The shots were fired downwards towards the earth on the Quebec side, not up at the sky and when each shot hit the ground (you could see light trails coming down from where the craft were) there was a loud explosion and corresponding flare-up of light.  We must have witnessed at least a dozen of these shots hitting the ground.  There was no sound from any of the craft while they were forming in the sky and no sound except for when the shots hit the ground -no sound of them being fired that I remember hearing.  My neighbour and I waited to see if the craft would fly away but there was no sighting after the shots were fired at all.  They just disappeared or left undetected.  I haven't heard of anyone else who saw what we did.  I called a local tv station and reported it and they said that they would look into it but I never heard back. Someone must have seen it besides me.  There are many dwellings on the Ottawa side of the Ottawa River near Mud Island.  Would be interested in hearing about any other similar sighting.  I noticed that in Quebec orange balls have been seen before  Interesting.  The room we viewed the craft from and the explosions was a typical apartment living room with one light on in the background.  It was getting dark at night when I saw all of this but there was still a bit of light out but not much.  It was around 8 PM in the evening.  I couldn't tell clearly if the objects were round or what but the startling thing was that they were quite big even from the distance across the river and they were a bright orange color.  Quite different from craft that we normally see.  I have not seen this again since that night.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,45.3813825,-75.70850071428572

It mostly held its shape, but every so often a flicker would come out of it at random intervals and at random places close to the main body, like a flame.

The object then moved slightly faster, continuing to the west, maintaining the same height. I watched the light until it was quite far west, but then continued walking back to the car.

The wife said it was a touring helo giving rides for the fireworks which is common but it was glowing and had no strobes.  After dismissing it, 10 to 15 minutes later,another one appeared taking roughly the same flight path, then another.  They traveled together and seemed to be circling the greater Tulsa city limits on the east side at about the same altitude as a traffic helo or the small Cessna that fly over head most days. At any given time until we retired for the evening at least one of these orbs could be seen.

We arrived at the field around 8:30pm.  It was still light out and there were already hundreds of people gathered in the field.  We were there for maybe about 15-20 minutes watching the kids run around catching fireflies and I was setting up my camera getting ready for the show.  I have a Cannon Rebel T3i with a 55mm-250mm telephoto lens and was playing with the settings to get the best fireworks shots I could. My youngest son who is 5 years old saw something in the sky and told us all to turn and look at it.  He thought it was a balloon.  When I turned to look at it I knew right away that it was no balloon.  It appeared to be some sort of glowing orb.  It was so bright at the center that it appeared bright white and had an orange glow around that.  As an avid photographer I had taken many photographs of balloons and knew right away this was different.  It was traveling horizontally across the sky about the speed of a commercial passenger plane. It moved very smoothly and silently.  It was probably flying around 15000 to 20000 feet based off where most planes fly.  It maintained its speed and altitude as it crossed the sky.   Soon after my son pointed it out to us I began to hear others around the field taking notice and asking what it was as well.  Everyone was looking and pointing at the object as it hovered across the sky.  It traveled about three quarter of the way across the sky before it! disappeared. In that time I managed to take two photos of the object.  I was so interested in watching it that I didn’t take any more.  Shortly after the object disappeared from the sky a plane fly overhead seeming to follow the exact path the object took minutes before.  It moved at a very similar speed only there was apparent noise generated by the planes engines.   The plane also seemed to fly further across the sky than the object did getting smaller until it was no longer visible.  One of the photos I took had apparent distortion to the object from shaking the camera. The other was very clear.  Once I got home I was able to crop the photo and get a better look at the object. It appeared to have some sort of structure inside the “glow”.  As far as what it was I couldn’t make that out.  No one in the field that night seemed to talk about it after it disappeared.  I kept a close eye on the news papers and news websites following the event to see if anyone else reported it or if there was any mention of what it was.  There were hundreds of witnesses that night but I have yet to hear anything from anybody as far as what they thought it was.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,40.752,-75.0072

Me and 1 friend.

I am just guessing at the height, but it seemed to be about 60-100 feet in the air.  I alerted my friend to this odd, slow moving ""firework"".  It had a red light in the front, and it was light enough out that we were able to see the outline of a rectangular shape ""craft"" silhouette with the light at the front. We looked at each other and said ""Whoa, that was weird"".  There were many other people present at the beach, not a single person besides us seemed to notice the odd light in the sky (Perhaps because they were focused on the fireworks being shot out over the water, whereas this was behind the beach)  As the skies darkened, we saw another light moving in exactly the same manner.  Due to the fact the sun had set, we were unable to see a silhouette behind the light, but as the light passed, it was not visible from behind. Another and yet another of these lights passed, at about 3-5 minute intervals. 2 of the lights dropped rapidly to the ground some distance away, and then after about 30 seconds, rose back up and proceeded in the same path as the other lights.  The last and 6th light we saw flew directly over our heads as we were leaving the beach.  It seemed to be about 40-60 feet high, totally silent, and once passed, the light was not visible from behind. Being that it was 4th of July, I would have normally written this off as being chinese lanterns........but, we saw the large shape behind the first light (a rectangle approximately 6 times longer than the light itself) and the added rapid fall and then rise of 2 of the lights.

It was silent and flying faster than any plane, jet or prop, but not super fast. It continued to the northwest and disappeared toward the big dipper at a constant rate of speed.

At first we thought they were approaching aircraft, but they didn't blink like aircraft lights, and instead of getting closer and passing overhead, they became stationary in the sky about 4 or 5 degrees above the horizon (hilltops), and after about 10 seconds gradually faded away. During the first 5 minutes of the fireworks display, we saw four more orbs.  They behaved just like the first 2, rising straight up one or two at a time, floating for several seconds, then fading and disappearing.  The orbs were clearly far, far distant from the fireworks, which were going off more or less directly over our heads.  We were actually watching the orbs more carefully than the fireworks!",2013-08-30T00:00:00,40.0582,-80.6362

We were at Mt Bonnell watching the sunset.  We had just regular 7x50 binoculars with us and switching those between us. There were couple planes flying overhead and we can clearly see them through the binoculars.  The skies were full of clouds and we could see the planes disappear into the clouds. Each plane was leaving a straight line of white steam from its wings. I was watching one plane to the north west when I saw a reflection of the Sun on some type of metallic sphere.  I only saw it for about 2-3 seconds as it passed at an angle where the Sun would have reflected briefly. However it was enough time for me to get the direction in which it was moving.  	It was already near a big cloud and it created what I can only describe as a set of giant smoke rings that were just being spread from what at that point appeared to be nothing. The observing conditions were perfect and since I was watching planes up that point I got a pretty good idea of the scale of that object.  It was at least as big as a 747 or slightly larger. This happened very quickly and I heard no sounds from that direction.  The distance between us and the object was about 15 miles.  My son saw the flash, but since I was the one looking through the binoculars he did not see any of the ""smoke rings"". Basically this looked like a giant mirror like chrome marble floating through clouds.  I've never seen anything like this before or since.  What is bothering me is that I have absolutely no logical explanation as to what that was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We do this on occasion, and recently have been seeing a number of unusual objects. On this evening, we both were sitting in lawn chairs facing approximately due south behind our house.  We are about 2 miles from the foot hill before the Hurricane Ridge hill which is about 4 miles from our house.  At about the roof line of the house, which is two story in back and just to the left of it, an object with 3 bright lights, all on the horizontal plane, appeared to have come over the top of the Hurricane Ridge hill.  I say object because the lights were all evenly spaced and moving together as one. We could not see an actual hard surface and did not observe any stars around or between the lights. Just off of center of what would be the bottom of the object, was a red/yellow light.  The three main lights were slightly yellow in color.  Holding my arm out at length and gapping my thumb and forefinger, it was about two inches wide at that distance. I have a green laser that we use when we see an object that appears to be different.  We are very careful to make sure an object is not a plane or helicopter with flashing lights when using the laser.  I pointed the laser at the object and turned it on.  The instant that the laser pointed at the object, all of the lights went out simultaneously.  Not one after the other, but all together.  The lights were moving synchronous with each other and not moving up or down.  I realize that being right after the fourth of July, there could be fireworks.  This was not fireworks or balloons or flares. I do wish that I would not have used the laser, because the object was moving from the south to the north in a slow motion. I think that it may have crossed over near us, but it went out immediately after the laser hit it. Within about 5 seconds after the object vanished, two objects that you would normally consider as satellites, came from the same direction, but were moving in opposing arcs, where they crossed each other’s path, above us. They were moving at a much faster speed than normal satellites do. I did not shine the laser at these two objects, as I just got an impression that it was not a good idea. A few days later, I don’t remember the exact day, there were a number military helicopters and aircraft in the area at night.

Turning at weird angles and silent. It was Saturday night, 7/13/13 at 9:30PM, when I decided to let my dog out the front door and smoke a cigarette.  My family was on vacation and I was the only one home unfortunately.   Just above the tree line, with considerable distance, was two bright RED lights (more later)..  These lights were circular, and much brighter and about twice the size of red blinking lights you would see on a plane, but not blinking.  I stared at it, and thought...hmm that looks kind of funny, and started to realize it was not a plane.  It was hovering, or moving incredibly slow, but definitely moving.  The two lights were always parallel to each other, but at a slight angle. I ran and grabbed my phone inside, just in case.   After, I noticed the lights started moving faster, and they started turning in a weird angle that no plane could.  Almost as if it was doing barrel rolls, or slowly spinning around each other.  This is where it got weird....I then notice two more red lights! , come out of no where!  They were just as bright, and also a similar distance between the two.  They all started moving off to the north, but you could tell they were separate bodies, or seemed to be.  Changing speeds, faster then slow to a hover.  The second pair of lights were at a weird angle, and definitely not perpendicular to the other set.  One set started going behind the tree line, and I ran down the street to try and follow it, but lost it.  The second pair of lights, again was moving at weird angles, and then all of a sudden disappeared.  I did see them pop up again, but then disappeared again.  After that, I stared at the sky, and saw nothing.  The weirdest part, is there was absolutely NO sound... They seemed like they were over the Connecticut River, and usually if we see a helicopter searching in that area, we hear it and it is incredibly loud, but nothing was heard.  When I grabbed my phone (Galaxy S2), I tried taking pictures, but they came out completely ! black because of the dark.  I even made a video, and it has th! e audio of me encountering the UFO and wondering what the heck was going on, but again it was completely black.  Incredibly disappointing, especially when I was trying to explain my story.  Another crazy thing, was the fact that my aunt sent me a report of an incredibly similar story about a half hour north of me, near Greenfield Mass (I can't remember the town name exactly, but I'll have to find it again! and try and get back).  That sighting was said to be at 10:00PM the same night!   His story has similar red lights, but he also saw a few different color flashes.  This night was a little cloudy, but nice and comfortable, with only light wind.  I've never seen a UFO before, and I'm still trying to comprehend what I saw.

I pointed it out to my friend. We were both amazed. The light was like 5 blocks away and grew in size with time till it was about the size of a single engine plane. It was bright orange, as bright as a wielders arch.  At the brightest point or top of the craft was a diamond shape. It had a tail that pointed downward. The whole thing looked almost as one but did have a shape in the top. All was very bright orange. It moved very slowly and made no sound what so ever. It flew at about tree top level, very close. It was slow enough I ran in to get the family. My daughter and her friend (both in mid-twenties) came out to watch. Four witnesses total.  It was not over the house by the time they came out, so the event was very slow.  We watched it go over the h! ouse and down the Snohomish valley and went out of sight as it made its way South towards Mt. Rainer. That whole event lasted about 30 minutes. We went into the house and were discussing what it might have been and wishing we had a camera. We were in the house for about 3 to 5 minutes and went out again to check the food, when my friend looked up to the North and said look and a second one of exact size, shape, color and speed, silently went on the same exact trajectory. It flew over the house and down the valley, until it went out of site in the far South towards Mt. Rainer again. These must have been under intelligent control as both were carbon copies in every way as the trajectory and behavior of both was exactly the same. It was not floating on the wind, as the wind was out of the east as it is most of the time in this area. I do not think we spoke for about 2 hours as we watched the sky stunned in amazement, but that was all there were.

My girlfriend and I were camping just off of Nevada State Highway 375 on the evening of July 17, 2013.  (Yes, I know, this is the so-called Extra-Terrestrial Highway, but it is also a great place to stargaze, boasting some of the darkest skies in the US.  Also, neither of us had ever seen a UFO in our lives). Shortly after dark, we were sitting in our camp chairs gazing up at the sky.  We had a pair of tripod mounted Meade 9/63 binoculars, which we were using to study the half-moon.  At around 9pm, I noticed a satellite traveling across the sky from North to South.   This object’s behavior was similar to many satellites I have seen in my life… with the exception of its slightly orange-reddish color.  I pointed it out to my girlfriend, who also saw it.  For the next few minutes, we tracked its progress across the sky, both with our naked eyes and our binoculars.  As the satellite reached about 20 degrees above the southern horizon, it suddenly REVERSED COURSE.  At the same time, a second object seemed to separate from the main object.  The second object was slightly dimmer and silver colored, like a typical satellite.  It continued heading south for about 30 seconds, until we lost track of it.   The original object then RETRACED its track, this time heading from south to north, un! til we lost sight of it near Polaris, the north star.  I estimate the entire event took between five and ten minutes.  We had time to discuss and verify to each other what we were seeing.  I have never seen a satellite – or the International Space Station or the Space shuttle, for that matter– suddenly reverse course.  I have no explanation  for what we saw, and I hope that other researchers might have some ideas or input.  Thank you.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

Our vehicle faced in mostly an Eastern direction.  Directly behind us approximately, 1.5 miles was and remains the Y-12 National Defense Plant from which weapons grade Uranium is produced, stored and modified. Immediately to our right, approximately 5 to 6 miles distant was the ORNL (X-10) DOE facility. At our 10 – 11 O’clock position was a DOE animal research facility. Continuing through the traffic light, the road took one past the animal research facility, to ones left, directly towards a fenced and locked gate (approx ¼ mile, behind which was a freshwater pumping station for the city), to an access road bearing left to a lake side recreational area called “Carbide Park.”  Built by Union Carbide for the use of its employees and families. When at the traffic light the topography is such that the road bisects two ridges as one continues towards the access road to Carbide Park.  One ridge descended from the left, the other ascended from the right towards ORNL.  The ridge lines were uneven in height but were continuous and forested. At this time of night the sun was setting and just a small amount of twilight remained.  Atmospheric conditions were clear, no moon, and temperature of mid seventies. While stopped, the driver of our car noticed something upon the apex of the ridge line located at approximately 1 O’clock relative to our vehicle.   He pointed it out and we all observed a stationary red sphere at the top of the ridge that ascended from the access road to the park. We stopped talking and watched. In about 15 to 20 seconds the red sphere began moving, following the ridge line to our right, which would be from a southeasterly to south to southwesterly direction.  The sphere was moving slowly.  I would approximate Its speed about as fast as one would normally walk.  We had time to turn off the car, exit the vehicle, and observe the sphere while standing in the road.  No other traffic was on the road during this time.  It was quiet without critter noises one would associate with a summer night.  We watched this red sphere continue down the ridge line for approximately 10 – 12 minutes until it was no longer visible. The sphere’s light was continuous, non-pulsating, and red similar to that of ones vehicles’ taillight. I approximate the size of the sphere to be that of a large beach ball.

The lookout was on Monture Hill, west of Ovando, Montana.  Ovando is located in the Blackfoot Valley, about 45 miles NE of Missoula, Montana.  I was nineteen years old at the time. During that summer there were several reports of UFO sighting in the Blackfoot Valley; I was skeptical of those reports.  However, in the very early morning of the first or second week of August I changed my mind. I had been trained to look for fires during my duty as a fire lookout, and thus was very sensitive to any new light that might have shone through the lookout’s glass window “walls” (the lookout building was about fifty feet above the ground, mounted on poles). At approximately 3:30 am, I awoke to a bright light shining through the windows.  Being a light sleeper, and having been trained to look for fires, I had no problem getting up to investigate. The bright light was actually two brightly lit objects, both hovering over the top of Ovando Mountain.  Ovando Mountain is in direct line-of-sight from Monture Hill.  Its summit is approximately seven to eight miles away (north east) from Monture Hill, and is one of the more prominent mountains on the other side of the Blackfoot Valley from Monture Hill. The two objects were yellow-orange in color.  Both had a similar oval shape (side view).  I estimate the larger object to be between 75 – 125 feet wide (this is only a guess).  One was significantly larger than the other.  The larger object hovered an estimated 30 to 40 feet above the top of Ovando Mountain; the smaller object hovered above the larger object. As I watched the objects I observed them to hover over Ovando Mountain in what seemed to be perfect formation.  I watched the objects for at least twenty minutes as they slowly hovered up, down and around the summit of Ovando Mountain.  They then made a swift ascent and disappeared in a matter of seconds. I have no idea what the objects were, but to my death, I’ll always believe they were something I’ve never seen before or after.  The U.S. was becoming heavily involved in the Vietnam War in 1966 and there were armed forces training exercises in Western Montana that summer.  These objects could have been part of a training exercise, a secret military weapon or something else.  But I definitely saw something.  That’s reason why these sighting are correctly called “Unidentified Flying Objects”. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",,,

I am reporting this for my grandmother and mother.  For many years my mother and grandmother have kept this story a secret, mostly so that it wouldn't scare us until we were old enough to understand.  The fear in my mothers face when my grandmother tells the story is real and I am convinced that the story is sincere. My grandmother lived in a house close at the border of a large field that turned into a lightly wooded forest that became a large blueberry bog.  The field was used in part to grow crops and for their livestock to graze. One night in July my grandmother was getting the house hold ready for bed when the pigs that lived in a pen adjecent to the house began to screetch she looked up and saw a large, fire like green light just before the treeline and the field through the dining room window.  She says it was very large, 80 feet or more long and nearly as tall as the trees and just incredibly bright, illuminating all the trees and out buildings.  She says it was bright florescent green and was oval shaped but didn't look like a solid structure and it just seemed to appear there silently.  Though startled by it she calmly walked up stairs to my mothers bed room, who at the time was 16.  She woke my mother and said ""Linda, you need to come and see this"". My mother and my grandmother walked down the stairs and they both witnessed the object together for several minutes when suddenly it accelerated into the night sky vertically at an amazing rate and disappeared. There is a significant bog where they lived, and when asked about the sighting being swap gas my grandmother explains that she has seen swamp gas having grown up there and this was most certainly not.  What is almost more compelling is that she contacted a local airport / national guard post the next morning.  Who told her they did have an unknown blip on their radar screen the same time she and my mother saw the object. Grass at edge of the treeline and field was discolored and ""crushed"". I have heard this story over the past 5 years or so and it is always the same and continues to make my mother very uncomfortable and often renders her speechless. What is interesting and perhaps disturbing is that I and my brother have had similar experiences before ever knowing this story of our family history. I don't know what to make of it.",,,

I know it was in the springtime and I think it was in 1970 or 1971.  I was in the fourth or fifth grade, that much I do know.  It happened in La Grange, Il., a western suburb of Chicago.  Because of the uncertainty of the date this event happened on, I am hesitant to report this, but I heard a plea to report any sightings to see if they could be correlated and so decided to go ahead and report it recalling any detail I could remember. It was after school, so in the mid afternoon around 3:30 pm, probably DST. I recall it was a pleasant temperature. The sky was mostly sunny, but there were large fluffy clouds in maybe twenty to thirty percent of the sky. I was cutting through an empty field at the corner of Elm and La Grange road which I always did when I was that age. Now there's a public park at that corner. I liked to look up at the sky. I remember that the sky seemed so blue back then. It seems to me that the sky was bluer back then, but who knows?  Anyway, I looked up and I saw what I would describe as a classic saucer shaped metallic object hovering over my head at about the two o'clock position. It was shiny and obviously metallic. I would estimate that it was maybe 1500 to 2000 feet up, though I wouldn't have known that back then so it is my adult knowledge making that guess. It looked like it was spinning on the outside. I just looked at it for a few seconds, kind of amazed I was looking at this thing and wondering if it saw me. It was between clouds, not even close to an edge. I remember the clouds were moving slowly in the sky but this thing remained perfectly still for at least 10 to 20 seconds. I just stood there and stared for that amount of time, then suddenly in a streak that shot off to the southwest it was gone. It just kind of disappeared in that direction in what I would guess was less than a second. I then focused my attention to my front and went home. I don't remember experiencing any lost time. I never told anyone about this experience. It is the only time I can recall seeing a UFO in the daytime. I don't think it was anything that could be explained as a natural phenomenon, but it could have been a manmade thing. Anyway, that's my report. I apologize that it's not very detailed, but it happened so long ago. I didn't want to tell anyone back then because I knew it wouldn't be believed, but it is something that has stuck with me all this time. Thanks for the opportunity to tell someone and I hope this helps someohow. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",2013-05-15T00:00:00,41.7776,-87.8605

As we came up to a country home just off the highway both of us exclaimed what is that?  There was a UFO over the S’s house, very close to the roof and about the size of the house.   We pulled off the highway and watched it.  It slowly moved along side of us and just stayed there for about a minute.  It had a few colorful lights and had a sound, not very loud, that I could not identify.   I never heard the sound before.   We both looked at each other and then it started moving slowly past us along the route of the highway.   I yelled to follow it and my friend turned her car around and we sped trying to catch up to it.  Soon, it went very fast, maybe what they call warp speed and disappeared.

I noticed three reddish orange orbs of light moving south from over lake Washington towards Renton.  What was strange is that they all had one pulsating light and it was large and slightly diffused.  Over the course of the evening I had noticed numerous typical plane and helicopter lights passing over downtown.  They all had a series of different fine pinpoint colored lights flashing such as red with flashing white, green etc. The three lights silently passed by and headed south. Strangely there were not fading lower into the horizon, as you would expect. Other aircraft with blinking green/white lights was following the horizon and fading into the lower atmosphere. These crafts were flying a direct line of site from their current altitude to about 40-50 degrees into the sky. This means they were not flying in parallel to the ground but descending up. I quickly pointed this out to the group I was with and they immediately noticed they were not typical aircraft.  At that point they began to quickly disappear into the sky as if they were leaving the atmosphere.    About a minute later three more red/orange orbs appeared on almost the same path. Their characteristics were similar but the third light seemed to quickly speed up before vanishing. The weather that night was crystal clear. The moon was out stars were visible. There were no smoke or vapor trails behind the lights. They moved way to fast to be flairs. They were not moving into the horizon like a typical craft but were disappearing into the upper atmosphere. They did not have a series of flashing lights but a slightly pulsating light with a reddish orange glow. This was definitely not like any craft I have seen before.

He normally works nights.  On his ""weekends"" it is common for him to be up late at night, ""playing"" with his night vision looking for various wildlife. On the occasion of this sighting, my husband had gone outside  and had been gone for enough time that I decided to go look for him.  I decided to try out front first, and as I opened the front door and attempted to step through it, my cat tripped me, causing me to lose my balance somewhat.  As I righted myself and regained my balance and footing, my gaze went to the mountain tops that are visible from my porch.  I was shocked to see the following in the very dark night sky:  A very large triangle(ish) shaped craft silently flying toward the mountains!  It was flying fairly low, say 500 feet above the mountain tops.  It was perfectly flat on the bottom.   I say large, because this thing seemed almost as big or bigger than my single car garage.  What was most bizarre about this craft was it was all the same color.  The only way I can think to describe it would be as if it were on fire.  There were no flames coming off of it.  It did not ""shine"" or blink or have lights all over it.  Just the ""fire"" that the entire craft was seemed to be covered in.  It did not have a tail or leave a trail, I would compare it to looking at the tip of a burning cigarette in a very dark room.  It moved deliberately, and moved across the sky as an airplane would, at about the same speed as a jumbo jet.  It flew over the mountain headed south west and disappeared from view behind the mountains.  There was absolutely no sound coming from it and it didn't light the ground up underneath as it flew over, almost as if the light of the fire was somewhat muted in some odd way, yet it was still fairly bright.  It didn't crash behind the mountain, and in fact maintained its flight pattern in a controlled manner as it disappeared. I was stunned. I immediately went back into the house and ran into my husband who was coming in through the back door.  He said he had seen something also, that ""disappeared"" when he looked at it.  He was coming into the house to tell me about it.  He described it to me as an orange UFO. Ironically, my son in law also saw something that night.  He told us the following weekend that what he saw was orange, and disappeared also. This was most certainly no airplane.  It was most certainly not a meteor, a shooting star or comet.  It is by far the most disturbing thing I have ever seen.  My husband was pretty freaked out by what he saw as well. It scared me pretty bad. I will never forget it.  Unfortunately no photos were not taken as I didn't have my camera at the time this happened, and did not have enough time to get my camera before it disappeared.

They were so low I thought they might be warning lights on power lines.  But they were over a field, where there were no power lines to be seen in the direction they were formed.  As I drove I noticed they were slowly moving.  There was no shoulder on the road I was on, and I raced to find the next pull-off.   Unfortunately it was in a well-lit shopping center.  I lept from my car, and pulled out my phone to try to capture images.  I was unable to see the original formation, as it had moved too far from view/disappeared.  But there were a couple of stragglers that were on the same trajectory that I did get on film (very poor quality).  They were travling from low to high, at a fairly consistent speed.  They were apparently traveling from Northwest to Southeast.  They appeared like they were on fire.  They didn't change direction, nor did the speed change.  Surely any kind of lantern or sterno prank (which had been suggested) wouldn't have been this bright. Also, there have been theories that it was a satellite breaking up, or refraction from a setting sun. But it was absolutely night.  However, they did go out of sight at approximately the same position.  And after the 2nd straggler was extinguished from view, there were no more.  I posted my video on facebook, and I did searches for similar phenomenon the next day, but I couldn't find anything in the area.

These things just float around  most of the time in the same direction until 2 days ago.  They look like silver balls from what I could tell and against the stars you can see them pretty well.  That's all I used to see until the 22nd when one streaked by very low around 3 to 4 am with a bright light.  I thought damn I barely got to see anything then looked in the other direction I usually look at then it came right in front of my view. these things don't usually have light but this one put on a quick show.  When a shark attacks you see its lid roll over its eye well that's what the light did over this ball.  It was more of a yellow then poof gone.  The weird thing is It was a full moon and clear sky but I don't remember seeing the big dipper which is plain as day tonight.   My internet was really screwed up the next day but sometimes charter isn't all that reliable.

My brother and I had decided to go out on his back lawn and look for shooting stars, as I had never observed one before.  We reclined in chaise lounge chairs and stared up at the sky for quite some time, then I saw a streak of blue/white light travel rapidly across the sky and then vanish.  My brother said “did you see that…that was one”. Shortly after this, in the same area of the sky, I saw another. However this time the streaking light (which vanished) was followed by another pinpoint of white light coming from a higher angle of elevation (as perceived from my position on the ground)on an intersecting course with the trajectory of the first object. It was as if the second light had been chasing the first.  As rapidly as the second light converged on the first, it halted in place; hanging there for a second…then executed a 135 degree turn to port, and stopped dead again.  After approximately one second it executed another approx. 135 degree to port side and halted abruptly again, suspended in space. This final maneuver brought the object back to what appeared it’s original course…then vanished.  The light simply disappeared so rapidly that I could not follow it, or it was extinguished. I do wear corrective lenses, so I immediately scanned  the neighbors houses for any lights which could have reflected off my lenses; from opening screen -doors or flashlights, or perhaps a cars headlights.  I saw nothing which could have caused such reflections.   I know that these could not have been manned aircraft; as the G-Force of such abrupt turns, speeds and dead stops would probably have killed a human being.

I was 11 years old.  At the parental urging of my mother, she had insisted that I clean my room spotless that day, which I did, carefully organizing my clothes and closet, hanging my posters, sorting my books, etc.  I was proudly sitting on my newly made bed.It was very dark and still.  The windows to my right were wide open with creme eyelet light weight curtains.  I leaned against my headboard and was getting ready to turn on my light to read, I was not sleeping or under the blankets.  I had noticed how still it was, not even a cricket or frog noise.  We lived in a house on the lake and there was always noise. It was extremely quiet. I heard it first. A slight roaring sound, almost like a semi truck or helicopter whooshing sound. My curtains were suddenly standing straight out and the light was coming through, passing across my bed to fall on the opposite wall.  The wierd thing was that it was like it was passing through a grating or window blinds. long lines of light traveling up my wall, not down, as though something was ascending and turning its lights up into my window. The noise was almost deafening. The wind was messing up everything in my room I had just spent hours on, papers were flying, my posters were being blown/sucked from the wall, books flying, etc. I dont know how this next part came to be, but suddenly they were in my room. At that point all I could see were 4 small creatures. Now in my adulthood, I would describe them as the typical ""greys"" only they seemed to be a little heavier in weight. I could see one was rifling through my closet, clothes were being pulled from hangers and tossed aside, just like they were curious to see what was in there. Another stood over by my closed door, watching, and looking down at the foot of my bed there were 2 more, their hands resting on the end of the bed, not much taller than the edge of the bed, and they were just watching me with round black eyes. I remember trying to move, to scream but was unable to, doing nothing but turn my head a bit from side to side, up and down. I sensed something else next to me, above me. Turning my head up and to the left there was another creature. This one was different, more ant looking and taller, more brownish in color. I could see pupils in its eyes. It was standing over me menacingly, suddenly with a quick movement its face was right in mine, just inches from my face, its eyes looking at me as if to study what I was thinking. It brought a 3 fingered and 1 thumb hand up and lay it across my nose and partially my eyes. I dont know what happened after that. The next morning as I remembered what had happened, I found myself sitting on the side of my bed, still clothed from the nite before, bed unslept in. Looking around the room, it was a total mess, papers, books clothes, etc. everywhere. I ran out my bedroom door to find my mother. I asked my mother, ""Mom, did you see and hear that huge noise and lights last nite? I thought an airplane crashed or a semi was coming through the side of the house"". I didnt want to get detailed about what I thought may have just happened to me I didnt want her to think I was making it up or crazy. She had heard nor seen nothing out of the ordinary. I told her that the wind was so big it made my curtains stand straight out and blew my room all over the place. She felt this was just an excuse and said I was making it up because I hadnt cleaned my room as she had told me to. But I had. I had cleaned it spotless. I never told her what really happened. A few days before this incident, I was looking into the night sky and saw what I cn only describe as dancing stars, tiny points of light looping and dancing around each other. Years later, approximately 1982. I had a 3rd experience. Something followed me part of the way home as I drove the back roads home. It kept beside me hovering above the big corn field along the side of the road appearing to be a glowing green oval shaped light about twice the size of the car. If I slowed it would go ahead a little bit and stop and wait for me to keep driving. As I neared the end of that road to turn onto another, it disappeared from my view.

November 17, 1977 walked out my apartment with three daughters (13, 11, 6).  Oldest daughter directed me to orange object in the sky.  It looked like a Chinese orange lanterns.  We drove up I95 a short distance to see other daughter. On the way back down I95 (7:30 pm) same daughter directed me to look out her window, front passenger window, and we saw the orange thing again.  It appeared to follow us all the way up I95. As I turned into our apartment complex it began drizzling and same daughter pointed ahead at our apartment.  There above my apartment sat an object about 30 ft. above.  It looked like it had two high beams, but no light was cast forward, as in car headlights.  As it appeared to approach us, neither of us were afraid.  All of a sudden it was right in front of my windshield although we did not see it travel toward us.  It got to my car in about two seconds, although we did not see it advancing.  It had three lights on the bottom.  Now I can’t remember exactly which lights were where, but there were two same colored lights, one in the front and one in the back under the vehicle.  There was also a light in the center of it.  It was two red lights and one green, or two green and one red.  Don’t remember. She never ever showed an interest in UFOs.  She yelled at me to stop the car and I did.  She jumped out of the car and onto my hood.  I was hanging out the left door looking up.  Above me was a circular metal craft, with a definite top and bottom, but no seam to separate them.  It was the length of my station wagon. I looked for widows, a door, an opening, screws and anything to figure what held the top and the bottom together. As it passed my station wagon, it very slowly skimmed at about 3-4 miles an hour (guessing).  It rocked back and forth as it went over us.  It had a sound much like the fan in a bathroom. I got back in the car first yelling for my daughter to get back in the car, which she did.  When she shut her door she said, “Wow, Mom, did you see that thing take off?”  I said, No, I got back in the car before you.”  She told me it took off like a jet into the air and disappeared. Once home a friend told me to call the nearest base (name not given here).  I asked for the Officer In Charge and reported my sighting.  He thanked me and said he may get back to me. By now my daughter came out of the shower and asked me about marks on her stomach.  I had never known about Betty’s  Hill’s secret, so I couldn’t connect it.  My daughter had three fresh needle marks below her naval.  We could still see fresh blood.  She said she didn’t get her skin caught in her zipper. About four hours later the Officer in Charge called me back.  He confirmed that I had seen a UFO because it was now being sighted over another state (can’t remember which one), but it was at least four states to the west of us.  He asked me if I would talk to two agents on Sunday and I agreed. The two men came and told me they were from UFORIC.  I believed them.  I remember the oldest man’s full name and that he said he lived in New Jersey. The other man I only remember his first name and he said he lived in South Philadelphia. It took years for me to ask myself where they got the photographs of all those UFOs. They had two thick albums with them full of UFO pictures.  Some of the pictures were drawn by various people, but most of them were actual photographs.  We could not identify the UFO we saw but agreed it was the top of one of them and the bottom of another.  They asked us to separate and draw the UFO.   They were almost the same except my daughter had drawn some kind of antenna on hers.  I argued that there was none and one of the men said, she saw it on the opposite side, that’s why you didn’t see it.  I don’t remember if we told him about the needle marks because I had not yet connected them to the sighting.  Years later my daughter said to me, “I’m sorry Mom for telling you all this time that I remember the UFO, but I really don’t remember it at all.  She wanted to pretend she saw it because I saw it and one of my daughters in the back seat saw it. It was years later I learned of the one thing Betty Hill never told anyone, because when people told her they were abducted or saw a UFO, most didn’t mention any markings and that’s how she knew if it was true or not.  I was stunned to hear this. My daughter died on May27, 2004.  My daughters and I were with her as she drifted into a coma.  She said four last things.  I will only tell you the pertinent one.  She said “Tell mommy, the aliens did this to me.” Personally, I don’t think she meant her illness.  Now I am guessing as she was dying, memories were passing before her and she remembered our sighting.  I tried to find UFORIC and there was no such organization.  But I did find that name in Canada.  I believe these men were from the government. I had been plagued with situations for years.  They started about 1963 up until 1972.  I was scared to death of my bedroom door.  I knew there were some “things” at my bedside.  I always saw the door start to open, but never saw who entered.  Usually, there was one at the bottom of my bed, one at the top of my bed and one mid-center. My youngest daughter when she was about thirteen used to feel something dragging her off her bed.  She remembers clutching the shag rug, holding it tight, knowing “they” were trying to get her out the window.  She never saw “them” and doesn’t remember if they got her out the window or not. Thank you so much for this opportunity to tell the whole story.  I will furnish the men’s names, where I lived and my daughter’s name if you request them.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,40.103,-74.9415

Since i met this sphere i felt that something happened to me. my parents had to buy me a Astrotelescope and i used it everyday to watch the sky in hope to see them again.  i havent talked about this until i was 21 but this event has changed my live.  i saw another sphere/orb when i was at holidays in Egypt in 1993 moving with our plane when we flew back to germany from egypt. The orb flew lower at the same speed as our plane. It was white , bright and it looked like it wasnt moving in the air. no shakes nothing. it wasnt a reflection in the window. other people in the plane saw it too, they tought its a rocket that would shot the plane down and we all would die. I saw this orb when we were over Cairo. The reason i saw it was that i looked at the pyramids.  i known it was something else.  Since these two events happened to me i am extremly interested in Astrophysics, UFOs, Aliens. They changed my live completly. Today i am 42 years old and still waiting for the day to see one of these objects again. They are out there, everyday. Sometimes they come down and we can see them.  best wishes  Andrew Germany",2013-05-15T00:00:00,,

Sometime during the day We decided to go somewhere and leaving the apartment building we got inside my car.   As we backed up from our parking space we noticed a sphere shaped flying object around 25-100' diameter moving from the south -southwest.  I passed without sound at what seemed like an altitude of 1000-2000 feet up.  Now that I am much older and seen many Jet planes in flight can guess its speed.  It was moving at at least 600-1000 mile per hour. I said to her, look , see that? She saw it.  And as we began to drive forward in the car I noticed it was going behind  the roof of a neighboring apartment building.

Our home sits facing south on the cliff above Puget Sound at an elevation of 328 feet.  It was 8:50 PM and the sun was setting. I looked out across Puget Sound to the south past Lincoln Park toward Tacoma and saw two large, hovering, rotating, oval-shaped crafts with very bright white lights that were flashing and twinkling. They were in formation and the one to the right looked to be further away.  From my vantage point, they were about ¾ the size of a full moon or larger.  Standing in the exact location if I extend my first finger the objects were as wide as my nail and ½  to ¾ of the length of the nail.  Based on the altitude and the jet planes I see daily on the flight path I estimated that 3-4 large passenger jets could have fit inside. The lights were significantly brighter than the West Seattle-Vashon ferry which was traversing below (east to west) as well as the lights on the jet plane that was traveling south on the flight path (to the southwest) and the red aviation towers that are visible to the southwest of our house.  They looked like light reflecting off a diamond on a much larger scale. The location was just to the right (west and south) of Lincoln Park from my view and just above the land on the horizon. I could hear the jet and the disks/ ovals were noiselessly hovering and rotating slowly. I quickly got my binoculars and observed a dark black outline of the oval disks.  There were no wings, no propellers, and no landing gear with very bright light radiating from the center. I watched them for 3-5 minutes at which point the one to the right began to tip and turn to the left slowly like it was going to leave.  I could see the dark underside which was oval shaped.  As it turned, the bright light faced to the southeast but I couldn’t see the other side of it, just the underside which appeared black. I went upstairs and handed the binoculars to my husband who then watched them for 3-5 minutes.  He attempted a picture through the binoculars with his iPhone but the resolution was not good enough.  Each disk slowly tipped to the right and departed to the southwest, slowly disappearing from sight.  As they turned the lights shone the other direction and the disks appeared black. I’ve lived and worked as an acupuncturist in Puget Sound for 17 years and have never seen anything like this. I have sat on my deck or near our many south facing windows for the last 2.5 years and am familiar with all the Sea-Tac airport traffic, military planes and helicopters, have seen meteors and comets, but I have never seen anything like this.

The reports are well written, and the witness seems sincere, although we would be surprised if all of the sightings are about authentic UFOs, i.e. alien spacecraft.  We cannot be certain, however.  PD)) Sighting #11 – July 23, 2013 – 6th sighting of a “UGO.” I was at my friend “Carol’s” house again star gazing, when at 10:34 pm we saw, to the northwest of our location on her third floor balcony, a brief, intense white glow followed by a “beam” of white light that shoot skyward, just a bit off of perfectly straight up.  After about a half second, the beam went off and the white glow remained for about another second and then went off, as if on a dimmer switch.  This brief white glow of light was of the same kind and intensity we had now seen many times before.  (See “A Brief Summary of 10 UFO Sightings…” and accompanying maps and drawings for previous sightings.)  The light, as before, appeared to originate just past the seaward tree line of Clam Bayou, and on or very near the water of the Gulf of Mexico.  I figure the distance of the light was just over a mile away from us.  The only houses in that direction are to the east of this particular location, approximately 30 degrees to the right (east) of the UGO.  Carol told me that this beam of light was quite similar to the ones she saw (while I was fussing with my camera all along)  before that was beamed up to one of the red UFO’s (which had changed from amber at first, to orange and then red) the by the glow on July 14th (“Sighting #8 in the above Summary).  Except that this beam was more focused.  And actually, this beam was not really all that focused like the beam of a powerful flashlight – rather, it seemed to me that it was dispersedly fuzzy at the edges, and instead of being a separate beam of light traveling through the glow, it was an integral part of the glow.  As matter of very interesting fact, now that I think more about this beam of light as I’m writing, it was really bizarre, in that it abruptly ended at the top of the glow!     As previously described in my above mentioned sighting, the top of the NGO was about a hand-width above the tops of the trees on the far side of the Bayou – maybe 150 or so feet above sea level.  What’s additionally odd, is that there hadn’t been any rain for the previous 5 days, and the humidity was not that high as to be “misty” outside.  I’m not sure about the previous times we saw it.  Interesting….was there something at the “top” of the beam of light that we could not see?  The moon was just past full and at 9 o’clock, and was in the opposite direction of the UGO.  The sky was overcast.  There was enough light in the sky to easily see the tree line.  At 10:58 the UGO reappeared, again, as if slowly turned on by a dimmer switch.  This time it stayed on for a good 5 seconds before going out.  Carol then went inside because she was afraid, but I stayed out for an additional 20 or so minutes, saw nothing further, left, and drove to the parking lot on the south end of Captiva.  I parked in the direction facing toward where we saw the NGO, and saw nothing for another 15 minutes, and then went home.  About a week prior to this sighting, I walked from Blind Pass south to Clam Bayou.  People rarely go down there even in the day time during tourist off season, and I’ve no idea why anyone would walk down there during the night, especially given the density of mosquitoes in the area of the Bayou.  There is also a large area on the exceptionally wide beach at the north end of the Bayou that is tapped off for nesting shore birds.  No one walks in this protected area, so it was quite smooth and it would have been easy for me to spot any kind of depressions from a landed craft.  I also walked around a 1/3rd mile long path that goes through the woods/bushes at an area called Silver Key, looking all the while for any signs of a landed craft – depressions, burned bushes, anything out of the ordinary.  Everything looked normal.  Although purely speculation, I feel that if I could get out star gazing more often at Carols that I/we would have seen much more activity.  Since my last sighting 10 days ago on July 14 (see the aforementioned report), I have been out at night 5 times on the beach across from where I live, from around 9:30 10:30 (when I’ve seen the lion’s share of my sightings), and have nothing to report for those nights.  Nonetheless, I now driven to believe that something special is happening at Clam Bayou.  Why Clam Bayou?  And what are these objections doing there?  Hopefully, time will tell.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

We ran into my aunt who lived in an apartment building just down from the restaurant—she was having light refreshment with a neighbor. We joined them. While we were visiting, a couple of teenagers sat down in the booth behind me.  One of them told a story that I of course cannot verify or check out.  I had a little trouble keeping up with the story because I didn't want to be rude to my aunt and her friend. But this was his story:   One weekend, he went to visit a girlfriend who lived with her family in the base-housing section at one of our air force bases. At the time, we had three air force bases in our state, plus one Marine Air facility.   Because I missed a portion of his story, I'm not entirely certain, but I believe he was talking about one of our air bases. Anyway, he said, he and his girfriend went to the base movie theater on either a Friday or Saturday night.   When the movie let out, he and his girlfriend and virtually all of the people who attended the showing began their return to their homes in the base housing area.  As they were walking, a siren began to sound.  Immediately, all of the people headed toward various base houses.  He said that there was no hesitation.  His girlfriend chose a house and two or three other people followed them to the front door.  The girl did not knock, but simply opened the door.  The family acknowledged them and invited them to sit.  Someone in the house closed the drapes in all of the living room windows and left the room, presumably to close them in the other rooms of the house.  The teenager made the point that there were drapes and not blinds. There were various conversations in the livingroom.  I cannot remember whether or not the family they had walked in on offered water or other refreshment. Sometime later—it was not clear to me how much later, as he was telling the story  but it seems as if it could have been close to hour—the siren sounded again.  The visitors thanked the family and everyone left. His girlfriend told him that what just happened may or may not have been an exercise. She said she was not really supposed to know, but she had learned that the exercise or non-execise was a procedure when a UFO approached the base. The teeanger asked, “You mean, like a landing?”  The girl did not really answer the question. As I said, I have no way to knowing whether or not the guy was telling a true story, but perhaps others know of similar procedures at other military bases.

It was as any other child night was for me. I had been in bed for some time, asleep for what I remember to be a few hours. To this day, as I think about it, I can not tell you why I woke up. But then again, why do kids normally wake up in the middle of the night? I was around ten years old. It was a summer night.  Anyhow, I woke up and there the lacy curtains I had in my room, I twisted in my bed to look out the window. I had thought I heard something. I just remember looking out the window and looking up the steep hill in the backyard. The night sky was blue-blue. But lit enough with the stars and other lighting around that you could see the sky and stars.  I seen this object. It was huge. Round, like pie shaped from the angle I was looking up to it. It was at least three- four stories tall. There were a few white lights in various places on the craft, but what I will never ever forget.. Was that even at my age, I knew no airplanes just stayed in one spot in the air like this did.   I was terrified at that young age. This thing had lights that ran around and around the thing, from right to left. Three colors, red, blue and green. Constantly. I remembered looking at it for what at the time seemed like forever. But now, it surely, couldn't been more than a minute or two. I ran from my room moments later, to my parents room. I tried waking up my parents. They wouldn't listen or believe me. Now, the other bit of news that sticks to me? I didn't remember hearing noise, or maybe I didn't think there was any noise while in my own bedroom. However, when in my parents room, I heard this hum. It wasn't one of them ear splitting, deaf defying hums or anything like that. It was soft. My parents later did calm me down enough so that I could sleep, but it was with them that night.  You don't forget things or make this kind of stuff up at the age I was. I was around ten. And now, I'm 39 and its like it was yesterday. I will never forget this.

Only Lights  Story 1:  In the late 1980's I worked at a banking processing center here in Phoenix, AZ, (Bell Road and the I-17), on the night shift.  It was common for us to finish our work midnight or later, then hang around in the parking lot for some time chatting afterwards.  Due to the type of work we were doing, it was only breaks and non-work time that would provide us a chance to talk. One night, after mid-night, we must have stood around talking for nearly 45-60 minutes.  The entire time it looked as if there was a light cloud cover over head and behind the clouds were single lights that slowly came on and then faded off.  It seemed to cover the whole sky directly over head and had been going on when we got out there and continued on when we all left. We all saw it.  Commented on it.  Wondered what it was. But never once...at least not until the next day... did any of us think of it in terms of ""UFO's"".  Then of course, it was a done deal and no one knew what else to do with the information. Story 2: I worked at this site for about 11 years.   Every night at break, 8-8:30PM, I would walk the perimeter of the business park, since we did a lot of sitting for the job.  Another night...and I wish I could remember how much later it was, as it could have been months or years...I just don't know.... I was out walking and looked to the western sky, it must have been close to summer as the sky was still a little lit up. What I saw was similar to the earlier light(s), except the was only one cloud in the sky and as I watched it, it looked to have a light behind it.  Like someone was holding a giant flashlight behind a cloud. The odder part was, as I watched, the cloud began to shrink and the light faded with it until the sky was clear of any cloud, or light in about 5 minutes or less. There was a co-worker, who was off that night, who I mentioned this to the next day when we were together.  She had been out walking with her husband and said she saw the same thing around the same time...however, she saw it in the northwestern sky, not the western sky,  like I had.  And she lived further north of where we worked. Neither of us had any of the classic symptoms, like lost time or lost memory.  Never saw any craft or movements, other than the fading on and off of the lights both times.  Unfortunately, I haven't seen anything like that since.  Yet, I have heard of folks who say they see lights over the White Tank Mountains to the west of the valley all the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I know this area well and have camped there maybe a hundred times previously. We were sitting on a rocky point called Lion’s Head.  It is on the west side of Red Creek and from there we could see most of Red Creek Valley from Bear Rocks area up in the north to where it curves sharply toward the west toward Laneville, WV in the south. We were effectively looking down in to a long bowl.  Suddenly, a C130 transport plane appeared over the mountain to the south at treetop level.  As it cleared the mountain top  it dropped down to the valley floor and hugged the treetops.   As it came past us it was flying below the point at which we were sitting. It followed the creek up toward the area known as Bear Rocks. As it approached the top of the plateau in the north it suddenly rose high into the sky and a dozens of paratroopers jumped out of it.  The plane continued  and we neve! r saw it again. We were somewhat amazed at this, the land where we were was a designated wilderness area, and further up near Bear Rocks the land was owned by the power company. We wondered why the military would be conducting exercises there. We decided to hike up to Bear Rocks to see what we could see.  We arrived at Bear Rocks with daylight to spare.  We looked around for any signs of these men and in spite of the fact that we were able to see the entire plateau from there, we saw nothing. We decided to setup camp there and spend the night. The evening was uneventful. Then at around 10pm we heard a noise. It sounded like generators. Looking toward the northwest we could see lights and activity in the middle of the plateau on a small hill. We could see people moving around in the lights and could hear the whirring of the generators. Occasionally, we could hear a person yell out, but we did not understand what they said. All of a sudden, we were surprised to see a huge cigar shaped craft move slowly over the scene from the north. It was between 150-200 feet long and had small round windows along its length. It made no apparent noise. The activity was frenzied beneath this craft and went on for nearly 15 minutes. Then suddenly the lights and sound disappeared. We could not see! anything else at this point. We did not see the craft leave, nor did we see where the people on the ground went.  We were a bit nervous about being there that night, but we figured they were far enough away that they would not bother us. We got up quite early and left.  On our way home we decided to stop by my friends parents house. They lived in a valley in Winchester, Virginia alongside the same mountain ridge as our sighting. They were both scientists and we were excited to tell them about it. My friends Mother had designed the original lenses for the first Land Sat satellite, and his father was currently designing some method for detecting marijuana plants from space for the government. The point is, these two were not stupid. Upon hearing our story they asked us if we had been smoking any wacky weed. They seemingly had a hard time keeping a straight face and I think they really believed we were hallucinating. We then went home, both of us frustrated by their ridicule.  About 6 months later I got a call from my friend’s father. He said, “do you remember the UFO you and my son told us about? Well the whole valley has seen it. It has been hovering over the north end of the valley for the past two weekends. The police cannot or will not identify it. We all saw it.”  He went on to apologize for not believing us previously.  Many years later I spoke with someone very connected to the UFO field, a good friend actually, he mentioned a story a CIA man told him.  He said the CIA man asked him where he though most UFO activity related to the government took place. My friend answered, ""Area 51"". ""No"", he said, ""West Virginia"".  He continued, ""The mountains there are full of caves and underground bases and located very close to Washington, D.C.. When someone has to go out and meet with one of them, they can sneak out and be back in a few hours. The president, for instance, is watched closely. There is no way he could get out to a place like Area 51 without someone noticing, but it is easy for him to sneak out in a car in the middle of the night unnoticed and be back before anyone can realize he was gone"".

She lived near the town of Shiocton. It was a cold clear night.  I’d gone out for a walk.  My sister lived on top of a hill, so I had an expanded view of the horizon.  It was open farm country.  There were trees behind the house but the view to the south, east, and west was unobstructed. I had just left the house and was walking down the driveway to the road.  I was looking up at the sky when the object appeared directly above me.  It was traveling in a straight line, north to south.  It was larger than any star or planet, but not as bright or brilliant.  It had a steady glow to it, a soft yellow.  It was silent.  There were no flashing lights like an airplane would have.  The velocity was incredible.  From the moment it came into view directly above me until it vanished over the southern horizon the time elapsed was no more than a couple of seconds. The brief look I had at it left me with the impression that it was not quite round.  It was near enough that I was left with a memory of shape, so it was probably not more than a few thousand feet above me.

In the fall of 1993 I was working two jobs in order to support my son and myself. My main job was with the Colorado State Police as an officer.  I worked a second job at night. This fall evening I was on my way to work from my home which was in Colorado Springs, Colorado and across the street from the Patty Jewett Golf Course. Backing out of my driveway (my house was second from the corner of a tee intersection) and then moving forward the short distance to the stop sign at the tee intersection, I glanced across the 8th fairway to make sure there weren’t any wild golfers playing at the time.  As I came to a stop and while looking across to the other side of the fairway, I saw a group of oaks that had been there for years.  They stood about 40 feet high or so.  Just above the group of trees I also saw what I thought were white landing lights such as on every FAA regulated plane that I know of.  These lights were very low to the ground about 60-80 feet high.  I realized that this plane was going to crash and probably into me or at least my block.  I just sat there like a fool and watched the lights approach. I also noticed that this plane was moving extremely slow and thought sure it would hit the group of trees on the far side of the 8th fairway. Then it stopped.  It just stopped in mid-air and stayed there for a couple of minutes.  I then knew that this was not a regular plane.  I backed up a few feet and parked my car to the curb and stepped out.  I continued to look at the object as I walked across the street to the chain link fence that ran parallel with the 8th fairway.   I leaned against the fence and continued to watch the object. It suddenly dawned on me that there was no visible object, just the lights.  I strained my eyes to make out some sort of shape to it but failed to make out the outline. I looked around to see if anyone else was watching this thing but couldn’t see anyone.  Nobody on the streets, no one on the course, just absolutely no one anywhere around.    I also noticed that there was no breeze, no sound from any direction, no barking dogs,  just absolute silence. I looked back at the object as it began to move toward me again.  It was only 40 or so feet off the ground and about 100 yards in front of me.  Suddenly it rose above the group of oaks along the edge of the fairway and continued toward me.  Once it cleared the trees it dropped back down close to the ground and just stopped.  That’s when I saw the red and blue lights on the outside of the two white landing lights.  I tried so hard to see some kind of shape but none prevailed.  I could actually see the background and sky right through this, whatever it was. It sat there for about 2 or 3 minutes and began to move sideways.  The  lights were still facing toward me but moving sideways.  That’s when I saw the outline of the vehicle.  It was cigar shaped with a red light at one end and a blue light at the other.  The white landing lights were in the middle. The only reason I could see the outline is because when it moved sideways I could see the jagged edges of the craft.  (if you have ever seen the movie “Predator”  with Arnold Schwarzenegger the only way they could see the alien was when he moved and they could see the jagged edges of his body)  This is the way it was with this craft. Being raised an Air Force brat and having lived on more air bases than I want to remember I can tell you now this was no ordinary air craft.  It made no sound what so ever. The craft moved sideways down the length of the fairway (south) until it reached another section of houses where it stopped, rose above the houses and vanished.  I followed in my car until it was gone and then proceeded on to work. That’s the first half of the story. My night job was manager of an up-scale nightclub and restaurant. I arrived at the club and entered through the front door.  As you come into the club you find a very large raised horseshoe bar to your left and a raised dining area to the right.  A 3 ft. wall separated the entry way from the dining area and the bar on either side. As I came in one of my girls (cocktail waitress) approached to inform me of some issues I needed to attend to ASAP.  As she spoke I looked toward the bar to find 3 or 4 customers sitting and having cocktails. One man was sitting on a bar stool but was leaning back against the bar and staring at me. As I continued to speak to my girl, this man continued to stare at me.  At first I thought he was going to cause some sort of trouble so I kept a close eye on him as well. After my girl left the man at the bar rose and came up to me.  He asked if we could speak outside for a few minutes.  I agreed and followed him outside half expecting to be in a fist fight or something.  We stood in the middle of the sidewalk in front of the club and he asked me if I saw something funny on my way to work tonight.  I asked him how he would know about anything funny I may or may not have seen. This guy told me that they were checking up on me because I was one of the “special ones”.  To this day I don’t know what he meant by that. For twenty minutes he stood there and told me of my entire life from the time I was born to the present moment, reminding me of things I had long forgotten about or just kept secret from anyone else. Then he asked me if I remembered the night (when I was a young boy playing on the floor of my parents’ house) that a red light beam came through the window of the living room, across the wall and floor and then disappear. I told him I had no recollection of anything such event.  He then pulled out a business card and handed it to me.  As he did, I looked down at it as he placed it in my hand.  I scanned it quickly and looked up to ask him something and he was gone.  He was gone. For years I kept this information from anyone in fear of being labeled some sort of crackpot and I didn’t want to lose my police position with the State. In time I moved from Colorado to California.  In June of 2002 my father died unexpectedly. I returned to Colorado for his funeral and came back to California to my home.  In November of 2002 I went back to my parents’ home in Colorado Springs to have Thanksgiving with my mother and other family members. After dinner, we all sat around the table telling stories and jokes when I spoke up and said that I had a story to tell.  There were about 20 family members there and they were all chuckling as I told the story of my strange event.  When I got to the part about the red light coming through the window and across the wall and floor, my mother dropped her fork on the plate.  Everyone stopped talking.  It was absolute silent when she said that she remembered that like it was yesterday.

I've seen two ufo's. I was with two girlfriends the first time, and my friend and his sister the second time – none of us were on drugs either time; we were about 15-16 years old (1993-1994) – the date might be off by a year (1992?). (And they saw it too; one, the daughter of a Doctor (MD) recently told me she has seen them again since. The other three are now parents; I am single.) I think (based on the Drake equation etc.) that there must be life out there, but still I would need to see it for myself to really know if these lights that we saw were piloted by alien beings; all I know, is I - we - saw these ufo’s - and they were NOT gas, weather, planes, satellites, meteors etc. Either way, whether aliens or human made, it's incredible the speeds and mobility and hovering abilities of these ufo's. The first one was seen on a starry night. It was located really far up, at about within our atmosphere; seen from Georgeville, Quebec. It move incredible distances in swirly figure-eight-type, seemingly random patterns, for such high distance relative to us, moving almost as if either testing it's maneuverability, or maybe even just wasting time, with nothing to do - this is my intuition about the flying patterns that it made; but then stopping on a dime, making right angles, even 180 degree changes in direction - it looked just like a star, a bright white orb, but moved like one of those super fast shinny green flies you see in the country, only, this was happening over great distances and about within or near to our atmosphere, hence the estimate of it moving great distances (100+ KM? in a second)and at great speeds. It lasted so long, over 20 minutes, that even as teenagers we got bored of looking at it, then went back in our tent and drank one bottle of cheap wine and ev! entually falling asleep. The second time, within the same year, or possibly within two years of the first sighting, the ufo appeared as an orange-multicoloured light-of-an-orb, about 2-3 KM off the earth, and we saw it from about 5-7 KM away, up on a slight hill, looking over the Magog river valley; it was maybe… 10’-30’ or more in diameter – if it was only just one, as we saw it light up from the dark of the night sky, hovering there for about 2-3 minutes at a time, then going out (disappearing/turning the light of the orb ‘off’) and then reappearing in a slightly higher and off to the side, new position (assuming that it was the same orb) and repeating this pattern several times, before one last time where it directed an arch-like orange laser towards the ground and this laser then reflected back up to the orb -  depicted graphically as one would draw radio waves emitting from a radio tower – and then a loud sonic boom followed a few seconds after it disappeared.

It hovered motionless - There were three large circular red lights that went from the bottom left corner to the top left corner. So one red pulsating light in the lower left corner, one pulsating red light in the center and one pulsating red light in the upper right corner. The craft was every color of the spectrum...light green at the bottom and then more yellowish at the top - but every color represented. Observed the object from a distance of maybe 200 yards.  Suddenly it just disappeared...I looked down for a moment and when I looked up again...it was gone.  Then in the opposite side of the sky four small white orbs of light appeared very high in the sky.  They fell and then rose up again like a yo-yo. They spun around and made circles in the sky.  They foll! owed our car for several miles - and rose higher and higher into the sky as we approached the city of Bowling Green, Ohio. Later when we got back to the dorm room (we were college students at the time) the 4 lights in the sky were still there ...we could see them from the dorm window - we went outside the dorm room again and looked up and witnessed a black triangle floating over the Bowling Green University Campus - It made no sound - very low flying altitude - only one very faint red light on one corner of the craft - the other white orbs remained high in the sky. - We went back to the dorm room and just before falling asleep we noticed white lights beaming into our dorm room.  The lights were wide at first but then segmented into smaller beams of light. - Then the lights started moving rapidly back and forth - Next thing I knew It was 5:00pm the next day - My friend and I slept the entire day - which was highly unusual for either of us… The next afternoon there were UFO r! eports on local t.v. and the sky that next afternoon was filled with a irforce jets buzzing about.

The weather’s a bit drizzly that night and slightly cloudy, and the moment I looked up, what I saw was definitely something else. There were three to four faint white lights in a diamond-formation. They were near motionless. They look like short white light beams sticking out of the night sky, like lights coming out of three to four flashlights from a distance and they were all pointed downwards. They did move a bit, the third and fourth lights swapped positions once or twice. The most unusual thing however, was the activity we noticed happening in the middle of their diamond formation. The best description I can give is, it looked as if there were black smoke faintly swirling inside their formation. The black color it gave was not the same hue of the night sky. It was really a scary sight honestly. According to my neighbor, he noticed the lights approximately 6:00 p.m. earlier that evening. That time he claimed there were four or five of them. By 8:30 p.m. these lights faintly disappeared, as if they went upwards. As much as I want to believe that they could’ve been any of the following: -	Plane -	Helicopter -	Sky Divers -	Flares -	Chinese Lanterns -	Kites -	Constellation  Unfortunately,  they weren’t any of these at all. They couldn’t have been aircrafts because there were no engine sounds. And no present-day aircraft can hover for nearly 3 hours in the same stationary position. They couldn’t  have been Sky Divers. Same reason above. They couldn’t have been flares/Chinese lanterns/kites.  None of those can last that long in the air and in that drizzly weather. Lastly, they couldn’t have been a constellation. They show minimum movement and they had beams of light sticking out of the sky. Although we have few witnesses, I did manage to get photos of the incident.

For three weeks, myself and many coworkers (several of us from the same home town worked at the same place at the time) noticed three lights moving in set patterns west of our work. These lights could be seen from a number of roads, including Interstate 70. The three lights moved in distinct, elongated circular patterns.  Looking out of the windshield of my car: on the left side of my view, light #1 moved up & down towards the horizon and back up while light #2 moved right to left, low along the horizon.  The odd thing about light #2 was that while you could track it visually moving right to left, once it turned around to head back towards the right, it would disappear and almost instantaneously re-appear on the right side of my field of view to continue the slow track left. It repeated this pattern. Light #3 mirrored light #1 with two exceptions: 1) it was on the right side of my field of view and 2) when it crested the top of its pattern, it appeared to get bigger while it traveled down towards the horizon.   As it got closer to the horizon, it would get smaller. I assumed this to mean that, as it got bigger, it was coming towards me. Because of this assumption, I decided to try to get its attention. 	During one clear, warm night on the drive home, every time I would turn towards the lights, I would flash my hi-beams at them.  This went on for about 15-20 minutes.  As I did this, I noticed light #3 seemed to get larger and larger every time it reached the top of its cycle.  As my drive took me through the more rural area of my home and my work, I pulled off the side of the road, stopped, and continuously flashed my hi-beams. 	While lights #2 & #1 continued their cycles, light #3 continued coming towards me.  Leaving my car running, hi-beams, lights and radio on (done purposefully to see if this “thing” would interfere with my car’s electronics) I stood as this object flew over my car. 	The object was dark (black or blue?) and shaped light a tear drop laying on its side with the pointed end assuming to position of its “tail.”  It also had 2 wing-like structures swept back at an extreme angle.  Each wing had yellow circles along the leading edge which I thought looked like port holes.  At the end of each wing, and on the rounded end of the object (which I assumed was its “nose”) was a pale yellow light, each shining down to the ground (like a spot light) though never actually reaching the ground that I could see. 	I anticipated the object to be 100-200 feet above my car, and about 50 feet across tip to tip (though I can’t swear by these dimensions).  As this was a calm, clear, moon lit night, there were no clouds or wind, but the object slowly drifted over the top of my vehicle – no sound of any kind and no interruption in my car’s electronics.  As it got about 2/3 the way over the top of my car, I looked back towards the other lights to see what they were doing. There was no change in their patterns.  As I turned around to look back at this object, it was gone. No sound, no trace, no clouds to hide behind. Just gone.  Again, the sky was clear – no winds, no clouds and an almost full moon which was bright enough to create shadows.  As I finished the drive home that night, I never saw light #3 return. 	For the next 4-5 days, though I was never able to get any further response from them, the 3 lights continued their pattern.  Then, less than a week later, these light disappeared and never returned while I lived/worked in that area.  I realized a couple years later, after doing some research, that these lights appeared in the direction of Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton Ohio…  	Alien craft?  Government spy blimp?   I make no claims that this was (or wasn’t) an extraterrestrial craft.  I only am attesting to what I experienced. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

At this time (1996), I lived in North County San Diego and worked for a private, not-for-profit, Institution of Higher Education (post-secondary), which was headquartered on and along Camino Del Rio South parallel to Interstate 8 (I-8). On regular work days, Monday-Friday, I commuted to and from work using I-15 corridor, and appropriate exits taking me to and away from my office location.  I had been using the I-15 corridor since 1991 and became familiar with smaller cities between my residence and place of work along the corridor. When approaching the vicinity of Mira Mar, my daily routine was to quickly scan the morning skies (while operating my vehicle), and look for Naval fighter jets in the skies practicing ‘touch-and-go’ maneuvers at the Air Station.  As memory serves, it was customary for the fighter jets, flight pattern, to circle and approach air strip from the east when landing or touching down. On the morning of June 18, I was scanning the morning skies but did not notice any ‘human’ craft in the air.  I assumed the Air Station had their jets down in hangers conducting maintenance on them.  I did however notice what appeared to be a brief glitter in the southeastern sky.  At first, I thought it might be the sun but the sun had already risen to higher elevation.  Then I thought it might be a commercial aircraft from San Diego International Airport at high altitude and the sun’s rays reflecting off the fuselage of the craft. It suddenly appeared in the southeastern morning sky.  The object was a perfect circle, brilliant white in color but blinding to the eyes.  Using my thumb as a gauge and extending my arm out in the direction of the object, it was larger than my thumbnail and perhaps the size of a 25 cent coin (quarter).  It didn’t move it hovered as if suspended in the air. I was driving approximately 65mph, keeping up with the traffic, and flailing my left arm out the window shaking my hand and pointing my fingers upward in the sky hoping other drivers would notice and see the object as well.  This is all taking place and happening within seconds, really.  I looking up briefly, driving, and trying to get others to look-up as well. The object changes!  What initially appeared as a brilliant white circle, suddenly changed and it became two circles or a circle within a circle.  The inner circle was white but it moved like gaseous steam, rolling over and over, and it was surrounded by an outer circle that was clear and translucent.  The space between the perimeter of the larger outer circle and the perimeter of the inner circle (the circle within a circle), was transparent and there was something like a heat wave that moved between the perimeters of the circles.  It reminded me of heat waves moving across a hot desert floor that can be seen from a distance. The object begins to move.  As quickly as the object appeared, hovered, changed, and reconstituted to its original state, it begins to move southwardly in the morning sky.  Within seconds what appeared to be an object the size of a quarter, moved and accelerated its speed and was now a mere white dot dancing in the distance. The sighting incident happened within seconds, and maybe slightly more than a minute?  I honestly do not know how much time elapsed.

I simply saw an aircraft stay in one place for about fifteen minutes, then shoot off into the sky as fast as a beam of light lights a room.  (There was a fellow there witnessing it with me at the time).  It was far away, so the best description is that it did have what seemed to be saucer shaped lighting around the bottom of the craft. As one light to my left would come on, one on the right would go off.  They were white light.  I've no idea how something stationary could instantly propel away with such a great speed.  From where we were, there was no contrail.  I was too far away to hear or not hear any noise.  There is high probability this craft was near Beale Air Force Base. The best part of this story is what happened three days later. I saw another set of lights in the sky, moving slow over the city.  This was however very very different then what I had seen before, so I decided to try to get under it.  I entered the freeway and headed in the direction of the plane until I was able to get underneath it while exiting on 34th street.  I slowed and stuck my head out to look up.  It was a crop duster with white lights in rows along the entire surface area of the bottom of the wings.  I feel this was to cover up the sighting three days earlier. This happened in Sacramento, Ca, in summer of 1999. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",2013-05-15T00:00:00,38.57580181028241,-121.45009956553221

Their altitude seemed to be above jets and below satellites. They were offset by a short distance and I could not tell if there were 2 objects or one.  Did not see an outline of a craft that the orbs were attached to.  They were about the size of a quarter at arms length and were perfect circles, they had no fuzzy edges to them.  They had their own light source - yellow/orange. It was like I was watching a cartoon on a huge screen!  I had a small 20x scope with me but I knew that if I tried to find them, they would have disappeared before I could focus in on them, so I observed them with the naked eye. Sighting lasted about 5 seconds or so and disappeared in the distance (not over the horizon).  They appeared to maneuver around each other slightly as they disappeared. Heard no sound and the weather was warm and clear.  Stayed out until around midnight but saw nothing else except satellites and an occasional plane/jet.

I could not tell if it was revolving clock wise or counter because of its speed.  It sort of wobbled as it moved but did not break this circular pattern. I stood and watched in disbelief.  It looked like what you would see if you took a bright flash light and moved your arm in a circle. But this moved super fast.. Then several minutes went by when it broke the revolving and it began to head upwards across the sky for greater altitudes. Its great height had caused it to be illuminated by the Sun. causing me to think it was of metallic craft. Around this point it was doing Mach speeds. The craft became dimmer and harder to see.

It went under the moon about three quarters of the distance above the horizon as compared to the moon.  I could not tell if it was heading due west and just losing altitude, or if it was actually moving somewhat to the south. The streak itself appeared to have a yellow/gold center with trailing ""sparks"", but the outsides or borders of the streak above and below had a green tint to them.  The streak terminated without any discernable report, either visual or aural.  It just disappeared at a point estimated at an elevation about one half the distance from the horizon to the moon, but well west of the moon, between Sagittarius and Aquila. The entire streak lasted an estimated 3-4 seconds. The length of the streak was considerable, probably consisting of as much as a quarter or even a third of the total length that it travelled in the sky.

White and Red Pulsing. I was waiting outside my girlfriends house off of sprague when I looked in the sky and saw dozens of flying objects that looked like stars in the blue clear skys around the afternoon sun.   After ten minutes or so they began to move around slowly at first, and I noticed that some of them were red and blinking while the others looked white and sparkly.   They would take triangular formations and the red stars would take a position in the middle of the triangles.   They would move back and forth, and fly toward the horizon, and accelerate at extremely high speed until disappearing.  Then they would be replaced by others that would return, while often the red pulsing ones would stay still or move slowly.  My girlfriend came outside and I pointed out the stars asking ""why are there stars over spokane in the middle of the day?""  She got binoculars, and when we observed them the white sparkly stars were only what looked three red, blue, and green lights, ! together looking white with the naked eye.  They almost looked like the pixel of an old T.V. closeup.  The red ones were just red, and clear blue sky in between pulses as if nothing was there.  Eventually, they all either shot over the horizon with seemingly parabolic acceleration, or strangly flew into the sun until unobservable.  It almost seemed like it new I saw them, since they were not hardly visible or moving at all at first, and as soon as I had binoculars they all slowly dispersed.  Whatever they were, they were definitely coordinating they're movements and seemed to like the triangle formation, although it was not a constant theme as they silently moved where ever they liked.  Also, the red blinking ones seemed to be more stationary as the white ones formed triangles around them.

I was reclining and looking up at the sky.  It was a very clear day with some cumulus clouds, approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit.  The ship was moving so I cannot recall how much of the wind was apparent versus true but there was certainly a breeze. I spotted a round object that darted in and above the clouds (my estimate is 6,000 -10,000 feet).  There was no discernable pattern to the movement but it ""zigzagged"" within the area of one particular cloud.  It made incredibly rapid changes in direction and would descend and ascend through the cloud.  As it changed direction it almost seemed as if it were on the end of a pendulum - it seemed to slow just a bit before quickly moving 180 degrees in the opposite direction.  I cannot estimate the speed but it appeared to be moving at a fairly high rate. Because of the estimated altitude and flight pattern I discounted it from being a bird.  It moved and changed direction too quickly.  I am also knowledgeable about military and civilian aircraft and I could not identify this as any publicly known vehicle.  The object appeared black or dark in color, had no discernable wings, vertical stabilizer or any form or propulsion.  The object appeared round.  I could not make out any noise or light from the object.  The object was alone in the sky as I do not recall any aircraft within the vicinity. I watched the object for approximately 30-45 minutes before losing it in the sky.   As far as I know, I was the only witness. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I noticed it a few blocks further down in the direction I was driving but disarded it since some trees blocked most of it.  Figured it could have been a plane (there is an airport around the area) or the sun reflecting against something I don't know.  I reached a stop sign, which happened to be in front of where the light was and I got a clear view at it this time, no longer blocked by trees.  Right then and there I noticed it was shinning bright white light with a different form. The light was brighter on some areas. No other lights.  Just white light and the shape.  It was not a disk shape nor cone or anything that has been seen in pictures. It just stayed there for what seemed to be 20 seconds.  I was trying to pull my cell phone to try and take a picture and I realized, I was still at the stop sign so, I decided to make a left turn to continue my path seeing as there were cars behind me.  As I turned I just happened to look back and I noticed the driver behind me had his head sticking out looking at the same thing I was.  I made the left turn at a very slow pace while still looking at it.  Few seconds later, it seemed to have shrunk in size.  Once I completed my turn, trees again blocked my sight a bit so I decided to drive bit further and stop inside a neighberhood that was underneath the spot were the...light, figure what ever you want to call it was.   It was no longer there.  Even if it was a plane I am sure I would have still had been able to see it.  Same as a weather balloon or anything else we are used to see on a normal day. It was strange but it was not anything I had seen in pictures or sighting videos.  It was just bright white on all it's ends.   Again, it was not a disk, cone, nor small in size at first.

PD)) Sighting #13 – July 25, 2013 – Seventh sighting of the “UGO” I was at my regular skywatch location on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, next to the rock jetty at Blind pass, when a friend and I saw another Unidentified Glowing Object.  I was looking just east of due south through my binoculars when at 10:08 p.m., I spotted a dim, unmistakable white glow that appeared to be very close to Clam Bayou, just west of my friend “Carol’s” house, where we had four previous sightings of UGOs.  On one of those occasions at her house, we saw three UFO’s in association with the two UGOs, in addition to an apparently landed UFO (see “Sighting # 8 in my previously filed “Summary of 10 UFO….”).  This time both my friend and I were prepared – she at her house, and me 1.5 miles to the north (as the crow flies), looking from a different vantage point.  I had called her about 10 minutes before this sighting to tell her I was in position; this time I brought a chair to sit in for a one-hour one watch.  She was prepared to periodically go out to her porch to se what she could see.  I called her just as soon as I spotted the glow, she went out to her porch, and saw the glow, describing it as “intense.” I stayed on the phone with her for a few moments as she was describing to me what she was seeing.  The glow stayed at it’s highest intensity she had ever seen it for a minute, maybe just a tad longer.  Then it went out as before, as if on a dimmer switch.  After a minute or two, it came back on “quickly,” stayed on briefly, then went back out again.  Carol, being alone, became very frightened and afraid that the UFO’s would show up again,  then went inside.  She did not want to go out and look again, or even look through her sliding glass doors.  I stayed at my location scanning the area for another hour, hoping to see one or more of the previously seen UFO associated with the glow to show up, but I  observed nothing more.  One important thing I learned during this excursion was that just because I didn’t notice anything more doesn’t mean that there was not anything to see.  It was unlikely I would have anything unless the glow was at it’s greatest intensity, and I was luckily looking straight at it through my binoculars.  There is no possible way this glow could be “swamp gas” for two reasons: (1) the glow originates outside of the Bayou, just past and behind of the seaward tree line; (2) the bayou is quite open, and is not swamp like at all.  If these things are on any kind of a “schedule,” then the UFO’s should show up in 10 days or less.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

I closed my eyes for a few moments, and when I opened them, there was a black disk hovering (I estimate) 1500 meters above my house. I remember just sitting there and thinking ""what the heck is that?!""  The most confusing thing was I hadn't seen ANYTHING in the sky prior to that. It didn't make a noise as I continued gazing at it in awe.  Now, I have always been interested in aliens and outerspace since I was about 5, so I ran inside my house (which was about 10 meters away) grabbed my camcorder, and sprinted back outside.

At the time I really didn’t think of where or how to report it since I thought no one would probably believe it anyway.  But I still think about it quite a bit, so I’d like to share it now on your website. It was around 1:00 am and I was getting ready to go to bed. One in the morning is not an unusual time for me to retire.  At the time I lived in an apartment over a garage that was separate from the main house and at the end of a semi-long drive way. My bedroom window faced the driveway.  I had venetian blinds on the window and the window was on the other side of the bed. First, I want to say that I lived a half mile in on a long dead end road.  It was a country setting with no street lights, so when it was dark, it was pretty dark. I had just shut the light out and was getting into bed and I noticed a flashing light coming thru the closed venetian blinds.  This was unusual because at that time of night most people living on this road were in bed including my landlords. They might once in while have people over for an evening, but if they did it was on a weekend, and this was a weeknight. Still, my first thought was irritation because I thought they must be doing something outside and I wouldn’t be able to sleep with that light coming in. It had to be a pretty bright light to be coming thru the blinds like it did. It was like living in the city and having a neon sign outside your window that was slowly flashing on and off. I crawled over the bed to the window and peeked thru the blinds just enough to see who was out there without them seeing me. The landlord’s house lights were all off.  But there was a light flashing.  Down the driveway and across the road were some tall trees, woods really.  Through the tops of the trees way up high I could see a strange light source.  It was like it was stationary in the sky. And it was so far away I could not believe it was so strong that it could come thru the venetian blinds!  I was fascinated and mesmerized by it.  Another odd thing about it – it had no stream of light attached to it. There was no ‘beam’ of light.  Then it started to change locations.  At one point it was on the road – literally on the surface of the road -- like a giant bright firefly, except it was just a stationary point of light that continued to flash slowly on and off. My landlords had a canvas structure for a third vehicle that was located to the left of the driveway.  As I watched this light it moved to just the other side of this structure.  But it was so bright that I could see it flash thru the double walls of the canvas. Again, it didn’t create a bean of light like a flashlight would. I just kept watching it. It was so curious.  Then suddenly it appeared right over the window I was looking out of!  It seemed attached to the surface of the garage.  I could see it up close – it was like a self-contained elongated sphere of white energy maybe a foot long.  And even though it was very bright it didn’t hurt my eyes. It was still flashing at the same consistency. Then it struck me – as I had given my attention to it, it had come to me – it was responding to my watching it.  Then I was scared. All I could think was the next move it would be inside the apartment. I quickly moved away from the blinds and within seconds it was dark again. I was too frightened to sleep after that. A few days after, I felt differently – I felt sad.  I had missed an opportunity. If I had been brave enough I could have gone outside and maybe really connected with whatever form of energy it was.  It’s too bad I reacted out of fear. I’ve often hoped I would see it again. I'd love to know if this has happened to others. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I noticed some changes in my peripheral vision, and when I focused my eyes to that area in the sky I could see a MASSIVE black triangle. No lights. No sound. No vibration. The only way I could tell anything was there was that its shape blocked the stars behind it. Either this thing was big as a city, or it was flying incredibly low, because it cruised across the sky slowly. Faster than a blimp but much slower than an airplane. It traveled north to south in a straight line. The line of travel wasn't directly overhead, but slightly in front of where I was. If I were extend my arm out to the sky, it was almost as big as my hand. It was a perfect equilateral triangle. I eventually lost sight of it after it got further south. I ran inside and told my roommate what I had seen. I told him I was going to go back out to see if I could see it again later. He was receptive, but understandingly skeptical. He told me to let him know if it came back. I wasn't expecting anything, but maybe 5 minutes later it came back. I ran inside as fast as I could and got my roommate, praying it would still be there when we came to look. And it was! We both witnessed the object move back over its previous path (this time going from south to north) until it was out of site (behind the trees and buildings).

I almost fell off my deck when I saw this about 45 seconds later another object exact same thing from almost the exact same position just slightly more to the west and at about 4 inches up the trail of the other object that trail only lasted a split second but to give you an idea of the second object/lights position. the 2nd object/light took off up and out at a 30-40 degree angle in a SW direction also, again same thing face south use a triangle with the straight part on the right and the 30 degree angle on the left, up and out of the atmosphere  10:15-10:30pm Fighter jets landed  not sure what I saw gut feeling like I said something was very different, not right, I do not belive that the fighter jets were flying a training mission over a heavily populated area, I do not belive that whatever those lights/objects were anything coming into the atmosphere, they were goin out, I have seen plenty of falling stars that was not it, I do not belive that it was space junk coming into the atmosphere either. the light was bright like melted metal and bright white.

One of them was about 45 degrees up from the horizon just east over the surf. Another was the same height, but more directly south over the beach, and the third one was the same height and much further west as if over the marsh. If I stretched my arm out in front of my face, they were about the size of my fingertip. They caught my attention because they were still.  They didn't move in the sky at all. They did fluoresce somewhat which may have been an atmospheric effect. It seemed like they were 'shining'. At first I thought they were flares, but they were so high up and, as I watched, they did not fade.  This area is a flight path for commercial airlines going up and down the east coast. The jets usually fly quite high in the sky. I did see a few jet lights passing far up overhead. These unusual lights stood out because they were closer, far larger, silent, and did not move. I went out the next day and looked around to see if there were any large light poles that might have accounted for this.  There were none.

The event was on 11/11/09 it was a Wednesday night around 7:30 in the PM. I was in the front yard walking my dog. It was a clear night, I looked up in the sky and the first thought that went thru my mind was “that is biggest oddest star I have ever seen” before I could complete that thought it started to move, my next thought was I wish a plane were in the sky to compare size against. I was facing my home this thing was initially to my left (West) and started to move right (North).  I looked at the direction this thing was moving. There were two commercial planes one headed in the opposite direction parallel the other perpendicular all looking as if they would eventually cross the same line in the sky (not a collision).  This item was about four times the size of the commercial jets; I cannot say if they were flying at the same height that is just how it appeared. This thing started to go faster and when it hit that line in the sky where they would all cross ! it shot up at an angle and it was gone.  The initial size was the size of a dime at arms length when it shot up, it went to a dot in less that a second.  There was no glare, halo effect, or streaking it appeared to be white in the sky and round in shape. It reminded me of the magic trick where a ping pong ball moves along a black piece of cloth.  I did not want that moment to end it was amazing. More planes appeared quickly; about five more in total all crossing around the area where this thing disappeared. A military style jet passed over much lower right over my house. It came from the Northwest headed Southeast. The object was only in my sight for around five seconds and the time it took for all the planes to come and go was a total time of around two minutes.

After the aircraft left the airspace, it began moving again.  Also, I noticed that there was a halo around the object and trail when it moved, even though it was a clear night.

PD)) Sighting #14 – July 26, 2013 – 6th sighting of Amber-orange to red UFO (“fireball”) + 4th sighting of a “flasher” + 7th sighting of large UGO + a ? I was at my regular skywatch location on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, next to the rock jetty at Blind Pass, when at 9:56 I saw an amber-orange UFO, which turned red. The literature also describes these objects as “fireballs.”  I had been at my location for 30 minutes when I saw it, due west of me, about two finger-widths above the horizon.  It was a bit more orange than amber, then a minute later it changed to white-orange, and a minute later turned solid red.  There were clouds just past the horizon and there was a light wind blowing onshore, making the air misty, so I estimate that it was no more than 5 miles away from me.  It took about 4 minutes to travel from due west of me to roughly northwest. It also appeared to be traveling away from me.  When it reached northwest of me it faded out of sight, rather than just “blinking” out.  There were several jets, common at this time of the evening, coming in from the northwest toward the Ft. Myers International Airport.  I was looking at an incoming jet through binoculars when at 10:06 I noticed a single white strobe flash about ¾ the spread of my binocular field of sight above the jet.  I trained my binocs on the area and caught another single white flash – these were a full second apart.  Then the single strobe started flashing quickly, but irregularly, just like the previous “flashers” I’ve described in previous, recent reports to NUFORC.  After a few seconds of irregular flashing, it stopped for a good 2 seconds,  It then came back on, flashing irregularly, and “jumping” from left to right and up and down.  This jerking around was more than the way distant objects “jitter” due to one’s hands shaking with the binocs.  Then a single red strobe flashed a few times, with the white flashing only a couple of times.  This behavior continued, with mostly just the white strobe flashing, for about 2 minutes, when I lost sight of it due to a creak in my neck.  This flasher was to my northwest, in t! he same area where the previous UFO light went out.  I continued to walk north along the beach when a white-amber light, about the size of a grape at arm’s length, came on for a brief moment, not more than 100 yards away from me in the Gulf of Mexico (there was no one else on the beach where I was at).  I stopped where I was, a bit frightened because it was so close.  When I continued to walk I caught the same light again from the left corner of my eye, and then it went out.  Most Interesting, is that a friend and I saw exactly the same kind of light, briefly and at about the same location, just a week prior.  We both looked at each other at that time and simultaneously said “Did you see that?”  Yes, we both saw it.  What could this light be???  Maybe it’s one of those “orbs” so many folks are seeing nowadays.  At 10:15 on the button, I saw precisely the same mysterious glow (Unidentified Glowing Object - “UGO”) on the horizon I saw with four fishermen on June 27, at 10:24 p.m. (Sighting #3 in my previously filed “Summary of 10….”).  This glow was to the west northwest of where I now was, across the street from my house.  Interestingly, it was in the same area that the UFO disappeared at earlier, and directly below where the flasher was.  Because (1) I and my friend “Carol” had seen UFOs directly associated with two UGOs we saw at her house (Sighting # 8), and also saw during that incident an apparently landed UFO with a white strobe light flashing; and (2) because I saw a flasher in association with “fireballs” before (Sighting # 7), I have to conclude that these three objects are truly associated with each other.  The UGO came back on a second time, about a minute later, and in the same fashion as the ones I and Carol have seen before – like they were on a dimmer switch.  About a minute later it came on again and it was REALLY BRIGHT, and gave me quite a freight.  At its base on the horizon, it was approximately two hand-widths wide, and just over a hand-width tall.  The next time it came back on, a minute or so later, it was not as bright; and the fifth and last time it came on, it was just a little dimmer yet.  I quickly walked across the street to get my chair, and watch the horizon and elsewhere for another 40 minutes, but saw nothing.  WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON HERE????  If anyone is out there is interest in the reports I've been posting for the past month, and can maybe give me some help in understanding what’s going on, please contact me through NUFORC.

We looked north of Market street and to the west.  There were two, totally black blobs, one apparently at a higher altitude than the other and slightly ahead.   If both objects were identical in size, then the higher one seemed to be about half the observed diameter of the lower one.  I first said that they were loose balloons since they were moving due east very slowly.  Estimated size of the closer one would be 4-5 feet.  Estimated speed would be no more than 10mph, slow and steady. No sound was detected but the street noise is loud there.  The air was wind-free.  As a frame of reference, a minute or so before we spotted the objects there was a small plane, probably a Cessna 172 or similar, heading for the Brandywine airport, presumably to land.  The airport is just a mile or less from that spot, so the Cessna would have been at 500 feet or less in preparation for approach.  These objects appeared to be well in the foreground of where I saw the plane pass by and by that I judged their size. I would have been happy to call them balloons and leave it at that but here’s the problem:  Small flying craft, such as remote-control balloons (or loose party balloons) are filled with helium and helium does its best to rise straight up.  These object remained, in lockstep with each other, at the same apparent size for the entire 12 minutes they were visible, until they passed into too dark an area to see due to the failing sunlight.  Worse, for much of that time, the lower one was traveling in front of a white contrail, which was clearly far up from passing jet, perhaps 20,000’.  It made an excellent frame of reference and it so happed that the closer object stayed easily within that narrow contrail of perhaps 1º-2º, gaining no visible altitude for the entire viewing.  The contrail, too remained in relatively the same position based on it apparent height above the TD Bank across the street from where we stood. Any remote control aircraft would have been far too difficult to keep on so consistent an altitude let alone two of them.  They would also need powered propulsion to maintain that altitude yet these were seemingly silent and moving far too slowly for any model aircraft to remain aloft.  But there’s no way anyone could have flown any type of balloon without gaining altitude or having some means to force enough forward motion to stop any such gain. There were no lights at all, the objects appeared totally black.  It was hard to discern any surface detail but I though I did see the closer object wobble a few times, as if it was rippling across its diameter. My girlfriend and I watched then until they were too faint to see against the lack of light.  The main reason I am reporting this is due to the inability of balloons to remain at a given altitude for so long a time and the lack of sufficient airspeed to warrant belief in propeller-driven aircraft. As background, I am a firm believer in extra-terrestrial life but not UFO’s or Earthy visits from spacemen.  I have strong hobbyist background interests in all science, space, flight, mechanics and engines, and observing nature, but I cannot yet explain this sighting to myself.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,39.95220216450217,-75.61569004329004

In August of 2010, I was staying in Los Angeles for about two months while teaching some Gracie Jiu-Jitsu seminars there. I headed back home (Southern Utah) in October, but decided to go through Northern California, see some friends in Sacramento, then head to Salt Lake City and stay with family for a few days before returning. I took the PCH to somewhere around San Luis Obispo or Paso Robles, then I believe I cut east to the I-5. It was very late (or early)... maybe 3 or 4am... I was about an hour and a half from Sacramento in some rural area with a lot of farm land from what I could tell. From maybe 1 mile away, I started seeing some lights that were really bright and aiming straight down. I slowed down to about 45 miles per hour and was watching them flying from east to west, VERY low (maybe 30' from the ground) over a field, then they would lift to maybe 80' as they flew over the Interstate, then dropped down again on the west side of it. As I got closer, I noticed that a semi was parked almost directly under the line of flight on the east shoulder of the I-5 North I drove up a little further and parked as well. There was almost no traffic at all, so I got out and watched. Being that close, it looked like a large, boomerang shaped wing with 4 or 5 lights (it's been a while and I don't recall exactly how many) aimed straight down. It was completely silent and I estimate it was around 40'-50' from tip to tip. Again, it would fly over the Interstate heading east (toward a little ranch house approximately .5 miles east of the shoulder I was parked on), 20'-30' above the field, then it would raise in elevation right before the ranch house, continue out maybe another mile, make a smooth turn south, and fly directly back to the west again. Always descending in elevation over the field, then raising up over the Interstate, then dropping again. I watched it for around 30 minutes and then decided to continue on. I have been searching for anyone else who may have seen something like that near Sacramento. I simply want to know if it was a civilian or military craft, or something else. If it was civilian or military, why would they be flying over someone's house with spotlights on, over and over and over? And what kind of craft makes absolutely no noise except for the sound of moving through the air? I know it seems strange to write now, but I have wanted some kind of answer since I saw it.

A few minutes later we were on the highway driving west. I was in the passenger seat and looked out the side window at the buildings and houses spanning the side of the small valley.  That’s when I saw a small white but translucent oval or spherical object in the sky.  As I looked at it a little bit longer an orange flicker began to appear and get bigger inside of the object, which I first took as a fire, but then realized as I watched that it was not burning and looked more like sequenced flashing lights. As I was watching the object, I was describing it to my mother, who was unable to witness it because she was driving. When the lights were flickering or flashing, the shape became more apparent and looked a bit like this: The bottom appeared to be rounded, but fatter than the top, kind of like an egg. There was a horizontal line that looked like it opened to the inside, in the sense that the lights looked brighter there, in that bar it was pure dark fire orange and black. Above and below that horizontal bar or line the color looked different, it was obscured and looked as it does when someone holds a piece of plain white printer paper close enough to a flame that it blocks the view of the flame, but you can still see the color and flickering through it. At that point I was thinking that maybe it was a project or something that someone was doing, floating a small paper object using a candle to make hot air and all that and I was asking my mom if that was possible. After a few seconds of discussing that with my mom, I observed something that erased all doubt in my mind and confirmed to me that this was indeed a UFO. What I observed was the object suddenly jetted westward a short distance, then jetted eastward, stopped and wobbled for maybe a second at the most and then jetted north and upwards so fast that I completely lost sight within a second. I continued to exclaim to my mom what had happened as I opened my window to see if I could hear anything. I heard nothing but our car on the road, surely if this was an airplane it would have made some sort of noise going that fast, but there was none, and if there was it was quiet.

On or around the 17 of june, 2011, I went out for a jog in my native city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  As I was running in a park in Calgary in a park called centanary park, I happen to notice the police helicopter conducting some sort of patrol manouvere.  I could tell that they were because the sound of the blades was louder, slower and the movement of the helicopter was in a sideways positon, as to look down to the ground. I stopped to observe it for a little while. As I was watching it, I remember noticing that when I looked at the rudder, in the distance I noticed these two objects in the sky, being stationary (this diverted my attention away from the helicopter, obviously!)  Eventually, these two objects began to slowly move away from each other.  One went north from me, and the other flew south towards me. I remember distinctly telling myself in my mind, "" I will observe both of them, back and forth, until I lose sight of one of them.  So, back and ! forth my eyes darted from one to the other until I lost sight of the one moving north of me. I still kept my eyes on the one that was moving south, and now almost moving directly over me. What I remember from this object was how slow it moved across the sky.  It also could stop in mid air and linger or hover. I noticed that it was very high in the sky - I can say that they were in the cloud range of the cirrus clouds. I also noticed that the object was spherical in shape, and that the fuselage was a relective shiny, or silverish material. Now, this is the part were it gets weird. I had noticed all these things from this one object because it had come almost directly over me, and its movement was slow. When it had come to a halt over me, I noticed - out of thin air - a spherical orb object, reflecting the sun aswell, being red in color, appear out of no where ! I was stunned, in shock and utter disbelief ! This would be the third object I had observed so far: the first one flying north and being lost to distance and clouds. Anyhow, I sat in shock, wondering what these two objects were ? I remember seeing birds fly around the area of sky I was looking up at, and this gave me some perspective on the objects. This is where the first shiny metallic orb started to move in a North Easterly way. I kept watching it, and the new red one as much as I could. Eventually I lost sight of the Silverish shiny metallic one in clouds in the North Eastern sky. The reddish shiny orb had not moved since it first appeared out of th! in air to the left of the silverish shiny orb. This is around the time when I noticed a second reddish shiny orb was in the sky to the right of me or in the Eastern part of the sky. I do not know if this one had simply crept up to that position or if it had simply appeared there like the first red one ( or the last one I had obeserved of the four ) Now, here is another observation I noticed from these objects that left me dumbfounded in utter disbelief. Before I go into the detail of what I saw from the red object, I want to state that: if I had not have looked and watched the police helicopter in that first instance, I would not have noticed the first two objects in the sky simply because they were really high in the sky, tiny and one would have to be actively searching the sky to see them. Anyway,  out of  the first reddish shiny object I observed, ( or third witnessed by me ) 4 tiny whitish looking objects, and I mean tiny, much tinyer than the 4 objects seen, came out o! f the first reddish shiny object and they flew towards the sec! ond ( or fourth one seen ) object. like I said, these 4 little craft were whitish, and I compare them to sperm because they had a tail or left a tail and there movement is like that of human sperm. I was shocked to see them and did not know what they were, but they moved across the sky towards the second reddish shiny orb. I do not know if they entered the orb or if they simpy continued beyond it. This is the part of of my memory that gets somewhat hazy. I don't remember what happened to the first reddish shiny object, but I remember that the second one I saw - the one that I did not notice where it came from or the fourth one that I saw - but I do recall it now moving slowly. At one point, I lost view of it  because it flew over clouds but then it appeared again. This is the point, I remember, where I began to start following it and I moved for the first time in about 45 min to an 1 hour after first seeing the initial two. As I crossed the bridge, I noticed a man with a camera and he was taking pictures of a couple. I felt soo compelled to tell them of my experiece, but I feel as if they were not interested. I continued to follow the object, I walked on the bike path, and then another person, a man, came by and I told him and even pointed to the reddish shiny object. He could not see it and I remember him saying something to rationalize what it could be I was ""s! eeing"". Soon after this, I recall seeing the final of the four objects I had seen this day, not including the four minute craft that came out of the third or first reddish shiny object. It looked to be getting smaller in the sky, as if it were rising in altitude, and then I simply lost sight of it due to the amount of clouds.

I could only guess at the date this event took place, but I remember the event itself very well since I suppose I must have recounted it for an hour straight afterward.  I was driving threw downtown lafollete on the four lane which is the only main road threw the town, on my way to a close friends house. It was getting dark out the time being around late dusk, my eyes focused on a set of three lights up ahead which were above the road ahead, but their was a bend in the road and I quickly assumed these lights were just streetlights, but as I got closer I realized that these lights were on the bottom of some type of air craft which was moving so slowly that it had previously looked stationary. I began freaking out loudly laughing and saying oh my god, while trying to get a good look at the aircraft without rear ending the vehicle in front of me, I even tried to pull off on the side of the road, but by the time I was able to I would have had to have turned around as I had went around another bend in the road. The road was fairly busy that night, and I seen a young boy in another car with his face nearly plastered to his window looking at the craft as well, so I know others could see it.  I can only estimate the size, and height of the craft. I would guess it must have been 10-15x as high as an average streetlight pole, as several times larger then a passenger jet. ( Like I say these are entirely estimates and could be off ) I could really only see the underside of the craft, I could see no windows or other openings. The craft was mostly a triangular shadow, with three larger white lights on the underside, one in the front, two in the rear, with a smaller flashing red light between the two rear white lights, but set slightly forward them. The craft was low enough that as this red light flashing I could see some texture to what appeared to be a domed covering which I would liken to looking like a cars break light. I heard no sound emitting from the craft.   I would like to include that a friend who lives near the location where I had this sighting had told me a story about a craft with this same description a week or so prior to my sighting. He had told me that himself and a friend of his were walking the road near his house at night, when what looked like a star lowered above them, and then continued off in the direction the craft I later seen had been traveling. When he told me this story I didn't believe him. I thought he was just making it up, until I had my sighting.  I am amazed that this craft flew so low, and in such an incredibly peculiar way, almost hovering in place it moved to slowly. Yet I have never heard another people say anything about it aside from my friend who had told me about seeing something similar prior to my sighting. I just for the life of me do not understand how web sites like topix weren't abuzz with chatter about it, how it didn't end up being talked about in the local paper.  My gut tells me this was not an ET craft, but something from here. The flashing red light on the bottom of the craft just looked to much like stuff iv seen, and similar to the lights on the bottom of planes, and jets.

"Saw a flying object, seemingly orbiting earth, when there was a burst of light/energy and the craft sped off at an unimaginable speed.",Rockaway Beach,OR,2011-07-31T00:00:00,chevron,15 seconds,"Occurred : 7/31/2011 00:00  (Entered as : 07/31/2011 0:00) Reported: 4/21/2013 12:52:28 AM 00:52 Posted: 5/15/2013 Location: Rockaway Beach, OR Shape: Chevron Duration:15 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97276.html,"Saw a flying object, seemingly orbiting earth, when there was a burst of light/energy and the craft sped off at an unimaginable speed. Im originally from Portland, Oregon.  The night of my 21st birthday, I was lying on a beach with my best friend.  We were lying there, talking about our future lives and all that comes with being an adult. It was a VERY clear and starry night. I saw several (3-4) shooting stars that night.  Being from Portland, I've spent a big part of my life in the outdoors.  I  study star maps and astronomy whie camping in the mountains/beach.  I'm lucky in that I'm from an area where it is fairly easy to escape the city and find yourself isolated in nature.  I'm an extremely clear thinking and fairly smart individual.  I've always believed in life on other planets.  Mainly because the odds are stacked against the idea that we are the only species that has evolved to a degree of oenlightenment.  My use of enlightenment, of course, refers to having the knowledge of the universes that we have obtained as a planet.  I had never had a personal experience with unidentified objects.  So, my b! elief was based solely on logic. Now to the experience. It was fairly short, but I was able to take in the information, look at it objectively, then immediately come to a conclusion.  My friend and I were discussing the complexity of life, when we both stopped talking.  During this intermittent silence. We BOTH saw an object that looked like a sattallite. I can take a stab and say it was not in our earths atmosphere. It seemed to be just outside.  As I said, very much like a sattelite orbiting the earth. This immediate acknowledgement did not seem out of the ordinary. I have noticed a sattellite or two in my time researching (amateurly) the cosmos.  So, we notice it without mentioning it.  That was when there was a burst of light/energy and it sped off into the reaches of space. It definetly had a shape to it, but it was very difficult to make it out from such a large distance.  I would describe it as an arrowhead or chevron.  The burst of light formed a circle behind the shape of this craft.  The burst was of a bl! u/purple hue. Also, a burst of white light momentarily trailed the craft/object for a split second. Being from the generation of the internet and special effects, it looked very much like the millenium falcon going in to hyperdrive.  Even down to the slight skipping of the craft/shape before it took off.  The craft was very visible before the burst, as was the burst itself. Even more so than the craft itself obviously. As I said, i've seen many shooting stars (and wished upon them too).  But this was no star. As we watched it, we both exclaimed ""Whoah"".  We then asked each other if we had seen the same thing. It was no trick of light, or an optical illusion from the cosmos.  We spent about ten minutes describing what we had seen so as to lock the knowledge and memory into our brains. We are both avid woodsmen, and have more experience with the night skies than most folks. We are two normal dudes who saw something brilliant and unexplainable.  As I type, I can clearly see the event in my minds eye.   I wish I was a more talented artist so I could render an accurate depiction of what it was like.  For now, these words will have to do.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,45.6232,-123.9101

My husband and I were driving home from a local festival in rural Lagrange, Ohio at about 22:30 or 10:30 p.m. EST. As we were passing through the center of town (in a roundabout), I saw what I thought was a huge fireball, falling from the north sky.  My husband didn't see it and I yelled for him to stop and park since I couldn't get a view while in the turn. Yes,I was indeed in a bit of a panic since I'd seen something almost completely identical in Elyria, Ohio in late April, 2012 close to sunset(I think it was the 22nd.  I had no witness and have tried to research it since. We live within 20 miles of Cleveland Hopkins airport, so air traffic is noting new to me.  I've seen planes in every flight pattern coming and going to that airport.  This thing was indescribably bright, orange/red in color and lower than a plane in landing decent, which heading west from North/South would be in almost all cases.Further, there were no visible signs of a tail or greenish color, which is more indicative of a comet.  I have yet to see a plane at night with no white or blue lights, and with nothing blinking. The color was so extremely bright orange, all I could do was yell, ""fireball!"" Just like my other sighting over a year prior, it first seemed to be circular and falling without will.  Once we jumped out of the car, it was overhead giving us an idea of it's speed.  We noticed then that there were 3 very distinct dullish dark circular shapes inside of a triangle with a redish ora.  The triangle then with intent, took a very sharp turn west.  I realized at that moment it wasn't a natural event, and was being guided. We got back in the car toward home to continue to follow it.  The trees blocked our view for about 5 seconds.  We quickly reached open sky again, and it was simply gone.  Planes don't just vanish in the night sky in 5 econds at a low altitude!  This was something else.  Military?  The closest air base is 4 hours south of here in Dayton at Wright Patterson.  Who knows, but I'd love to know if anyone has a reasonable explanation for this!  There were a lot of people out with the festival ending so I can only assume more people saw this thing!

The lights were red, green, and light yellow that emanated from sharp, individual points that flashed rapidly off and on intermittently.

I was inside the house waiting for my 3 friends as they were on the front porch smoking.   My 1 friend ran in the house and said ""the lights are back, you gotta see this.""   I ran out to the driveway and looked up....could not believe what I was looking at.  I was looking at 5 large red orb lights moving in formation very slowly south to north toward the Bend Airport.  The lights were about 500 feet over us and just south of us by maybe 1000 feet.  this was a very close up view and I kept thinking OMG, it's like a mothership out of Star Wars.  The night was very dark and clear, new moon.  I could not see an outline of an aircraft, just large red orb lights about 100 feet or so aprt, in formation or perhaps attached together as one large craft.  I believe it was one large craft, as they were totally syncronized.  The lights moved north toward ! the airport at probably 20 mph or so, then made a 90 degree turn east and moved out into the desert.  We watched for about 15-20 minutes, until they were so far out, we didnt have as good a view.  As the lights turned east, the lights went from one long 5 light row, to intermittent blinking and triangular formations, with up to 8 or 10 lights.  The night was calm, no wind at all.  The night was so quiet, you could hear a pin drop and this craft was silent.  The distance from side to side of the lights was hundreds of  feet wide.  The same friends have seen these lights on several ocassions and have had numerous sightings, day and night in this area for many years and have seen massive motherships (for lack of a better description) in broad daylight.  From reading other reports, I know others are seeing the same lights.....  I am a Christian KJV AV1611 Bible believer and do not pay too much mind to this sort of thing, but know exactly what I saw and it is not like anything I! have ever seen before and nothing like this is know to exist ! publicly ... the lights looked just like the famous ""lights over phoenix, AZ, which have been dismissed as weather balloons.  Rest assured, these were no weather balloons and neither were the lights over Phoenix..... As I said, it was so dark, we could not see an outline of a craft, just felt like the lights were attached to one and it was like nothing know to man, more like sci-fi stuff.... enormous!!!

We went there so that my mom could get a specific set of treatments that lasted almost six weeks for a very rare cancer that she had.  The treatments were successful; but that is not what this is about. On January 23, the very first night of the Chinese New Year 2012, my mom's doctor, ((name deleted)), his girlfriend ((name deleted)), my stepfather's granddaughter ((name deleted)) and I all went to the Bund aka the Zhongshan Dongyi Road waterfront area in central Shanghai to celebrate the incoming Year of the Dragon with thousands of Chinese and other visitors for the from all over the world.  The Bund is the picturesque area overlooking the Yangtze River where the river takes a dramatic bend and where the most incredible and unique architecturally designed buildings reside along both sides of  its bank.   Most of the buildings, hotels, banks, etc. in that area are very, very modern and very, very tall skyscrapers that are elaborately lit up as soon as night falls.  They are truly something to behold.  Not all of the buildings are new, but are older, well preserved buildings that are also elaborately lit up when evening comes to show off their glory from an earlier time in Shanghai history when the Germans had an influence on the architecture in Shanghai.  Whenever you see a picture/photo of Shanghai you will most often see the area that I am describing here. I forget the name of the hotel we ended up celebrating the beginning of the Year of the Dragon in, but it was gorgeous and it had close to 120 floors.  We ended up spending the evening in a very scenic cocktail/party lounge area that occupied the entire 97th floor.  We arrived at about 10:30 pm that night.  We went there to celebrate, enjoy the crowd, the beautiful panoramic view overlooking the all of Shanghai, the Yangtze River and the all of the amazing skyscrapers on both sides of the river that were beautifully lit up and shimmering over the Yangtze.  We could look down through any window on that floor and be able to see the fireworks that were being fired up into the sky from hundreds of different areas of the city and beyond.  We had to look down upon the fireworks because they weren't able to reach up and explode in the sky as high up as we were on the 97th  floor.  You also could literally walk from one window to the next and then end up where you started from to get an even broader view of the city.  In other words, we had a panoramic view from every angle of the lounge since all the walls on the 97th floor were made of window glass. They really go for the gold in China on the very first night of the Chinese New Year—a celebration that goes on for almost two weeks.  This night was particularly special because it was the Year of the Dragon and super special because it was the the night I saw an orange orb in the sky fly between my building and the building across the Yangtze River from me.  It was an orange orb that flew much higher in the sky than any of the fireworks were able to reach that were exploding below. Here is where my sighting begins:  At exactly ten seconds before midnight everyone started the New Year's Eve countdown.  When the clock ticked to midnight we all began cheering, toasting each other and giving each other hugs.  It was at that very same moment when most of the people around us were still embracing and wishing each other a “Happy New Year” that ((woman's name deleted)), my stepfather's granddaughter, asked me to look out the window to help her identify what this strange round orange orb was that was coming toward us from just above and maybe about a quarter of  a mile behind one of the buildings facing us on the opposing bank of the Yangtze.  It was a bright orange glowing ball/orb.  It was not overly bright, nor emitting a glare. I would say that 99.8%  of it was orange with only a slightly bit yellow at the back end of it.  However, I couldn't see the tiny bit of yellow on the back of it until it made a smooth and steady turn in front of me--going from my right to my left as I faced it--between our building and the building it had to pass in front of and over the river in order to make that turn.  Before making that turn though, ((woman's name deleted)) and I initially thought the orange orb could possibly have been a type of flare that the military uses a parachute to suspend it from to light up an area; but we decided, no, it couldn't have been a flare because it wasn't floating down--it  maintained its height and was coming toward us too fast and too steadily to be that type of flare. From my very first sighting of it it took approximately eight to ten seconds for it to reach the area where it made the turn between the buildings.  I really got a good look at it.  It was gliding, but going fast.  It flew in the air space a helicopter would fly in and, yet, it was flying so low in the sky in an area where any jet, large or small, would never be allowed to fly within.  I have to add that I have never seen, nor do I believe I ever will see a helicopter or airplane/jet make such a fast-gliding sharp/tight turn—I don't believe its possible. We weren't the only ones who saw it because several people around us were shouting out, “UFO!”  Right at the moment when the orange orb began making its turn over the river I excitedly asked Dr. ((name deleted)) and ((name deleted)) to come over and take a look at it with me.  He was a little bit farther away from the window than I was within the interior of the lounge.  They were in an embrace, but I felt that I had to break them up in order to call both their attention to the orange orb in the sky.  I didn't feel guilty!  As I began calling out to Dr. ((name deleted)), that is when ((woman's name deleted)) took off running from one window to the next in an attempt to keep sight of the orange orb until it disappeared.  A few others ran after it with her, as I recall  I didn't run after it; I'm not the running type.  It was too crowded in the lounge and as  I say, I started having a conversation with Dr. ((name deleted)) about what we all had just witnessed.  He said that he, himself, had seen many UFO's in China—that many people often do.  In fact, so did Yoko.  They acted like it really was no big thing and weren't nearly as excited as I was about it.  I was in a tizzy because it was my first experience with a UFO!   It wasn't a jet, it wasn't a helicopter, nor a parachutist.  It was a UFO--none of us could explain what it was, so it had to be a UFO.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,,

Do you see that?""  I had just locked eyes on it while coming out of a curve in the road when she did this.  It was huge and by that it looked to be several miles long in mass and length if it were in our lower atmosphere! If it were higher in the upper heaven then it could even span perhaps hundreds of miles!  There is not telling how far up it was or how big it really was. Measure from the top of a car's rear view mirror to the middle of the windshield and that is how much space it took up of that area and it looked as high up there in space as the stars look among the constellations, then it tilted downward as if it were dipping low and vaporized right before our eyes but left a faint flash of light o! range yellow in an oblong design along it's outer perimeter between the bottom and middle lights. She had been looking at it and trying to figure just what it was while talking on her cell phone which she immediately told her sister she had to hang up and then it disappeared in a second from her hanging up the phone. I saw it no more than perhaps two no more than three seconds. She saw it maybe seven to eight seconds also. But boy is it etched into my mind! It reminded me of how the triangle craft in Arizona looked that made UFO history. But this dwarfed that image. And it was slanted sideways at an angle. It was super massive. This is happening during a near full moon on a clear starry night. There were no clouds or obstructions for it to disappear in or behind. It startled us very much and we were so relieved it disappeared as it scared us good! The wife commented how glad she was it was gone. We rode home looking out the windshield fervently and methodically paying close! attention to the skies. I actually veered of the road once an! d she be ing a woman of no nonsense would usually get on to me about watching where I'm going but she was too mesmerized at gazing out the window that it did not phase her much which trust me is highly unusual behavior for her! We slowly rode home watching the heavens.  When we got home a bright light came over the trees from the woods near our home as I was talking to my son on the phone about that massive UFO in the backyard. I was still watching the skies because of the earlier observation. This was perhaps twenty minutes later at 9:34 pm. I opened the back door and called for the wife to please come see this strange light. She came outside and we both agreed it might just be a plane as it was on the path planes usually come up over the woods from. But I noted there was no noise and the light was going too fast for an airplane. She said...  ""That s just a plane""...&#12288; but it reminded me of an encounter we reported on your site just after Christmas about a fireball we encountered up close because it was unusually bright and commanded your attention. As it rose higher into the airspace it was dazzling bright then instantly dimmed away like a vacuum tube does when the power is turned off and simply disappeared right before ! our eyes just like that last fireball did we had saw right after Christmas. The sky was clear and the bright moon was lighting everything up and there was no place for that craft to hide behind or cloud to absorb into and it was getting closer to us not going away into some other area. I've seen planes disappear like that before and wonder what causes that effect but this was totally different in the way the largeness of the craft was becoming and the brightness it was emitting. Well she exclaimed...""That's two UFO encounters in less than a half hour's time!"" I noticed also after that episode that all of the planes traveling by were all smaller and dimmer and had flashing lights that you always take mental note of when seeing them passing over in the night sky.  My son was listening to all of this happening on the phone so he is an audio witness.  I'm reporting this out of great concern and if anyone reading this account had seen this very frightening event then you would be thinking like I am that it has nothing to do with our technologies and it certainly is nothing we have in our hangers! It is just too massive to hide anyplace. I'm never going to be the same about what's out there! I saw this mother ship even if it were just a few seconds and it was truly a life changing event. I am so glad also I did not behold it any longer than I did because I'm spooked just writing this.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,,

This thing wasn't getting smaller as if moving away from me, or getting bigger as to be coming towards me.  It then suddenly veered to the right and disappeared. So weird.  I looked around and there was another one, it did start to get smaller so I thought, oh that is probably a plane, then, it just stayed there, and stayed there.  My kids had friends over, so I called them out,  I asked what they thought that could be, they said maybe a shooting star, I laughed and said, then why isn't it shooting, I told them to look close at the different color lights flashing and it's not moving.  One of the boys(and I think the others too) got scared, so I told them to just go watch their movie.  I went up and got my friend that is livi! ng with us, out of bed.  She was fascinated too.  She and I watched, while it stayed there for a long time, until we were so tired and went to bed.  She also could see the Different color lights.We both could see that the lights were repeating, so came to the conclusion that they were moving around and around the object.  So strange!!

Trailing the aircraft, at not that great of a distance was a white cylindrical cigar shaped object.  It was not all that spectacular, but I realized I had never seen an object like this before.  There were no wings, just a long white cylindrical cigar shaped object following the airliner through the sky.  There was also no visible exhaust coming from this object, it just appeared to be cruising through the sky.   As I watched the airliner and the object the! y disappeared behind some trees, and I was not able to see the two again.

I was wheeling the trash out to the end of the driveway for the Friday morning pickup when I looked up and noticed a light in the northern horizon.  At first I thought this was a landing light of a craft coming into Harrisburg, then I realized the bearing of this craft was southerly, and if the craft was moving easterly or northerly to land at Harrisburg I would not see the light. Realizing that Washington was too far south for the landing light to be activated my attention was now focused on this light. The light was queer in that it was not as bright as landing lights which I have witnessed before, and oddly there was no beam projecting from the light and no streaking  emanating about the light which would normally be noticed with a bright light in the sky. It was like a dull light, for lack of a better explanation. I waited for at least 5 minutes for whatever this light was coming from to pass over. What passed was not expected. It was a “simple delta wing” craft with an estimated length of 300 feet and an estimated width at base of 200 feet travelling at an estimated height of 1000 feet. The course of travel was south by southwest and it was passing over our house and our neighbors house to the right with the better part over our neighbors house, allowing me to get a better perspective on the craft. There was absolutely no noise. There were no markings. The color was a very dull sheen. The craft was moving so slowly I could not estimate the speed. As the craft passed over the view of the underside was unobstructed. Since it was at dusk, but not dark, I could see what is best described as a half walnut pod on the underside, with an estimated length of 100 feet. On the side of the pod was a horizontal single row of what I first thought appeared like rectangular shaped windows but soon realized were not windows. Emanating from each rectangular shape was a grayish-greenish cast with an undulating darker gray shadow in the center. As the craft passed over and the back of the craft was coming into view I realized there were no other lights on the craft and no conventional tail section. I estimate the depth of the pod at maybe 20-30 feet and the depth of the main body also at 20-30 feet. I use the word estimate throughout this explanation as my perspective is based on viewing conventional craft. This craft could have been considerably larger but my senses were it approximated my noted dimensions. I was not frightened, I was intrigued, almost mesmerized by the craft. As the craft passed I briefly remember thinking if this was the “Aurora” program it was based on no known technology of today. Beyond relating my observations to my wife, in a rather animated manner, I have related very little to very few. The part which bothers me the most is the clarity of this my observation and the fact that I can’t seem to stop thinking about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

My wife, aunt, son and myself witnessed a very bright amber/orange ball moving at about the rate of a jet plane descending toward a local airport.  It flew below a thick cloud deck and was in clear view.  There were no flashing lights, or headlights or the typical red & green nav lights we see on planes.  It was silent and appeared as a ""fireball"" for lack of a better term.  The light it emitted was constant until the last 2 or 3 seconds of the event.  It traveled from the south, due north directly overhead.   We watched it approaching, move overhead and then away from us - again, no flashing lights or landing lights of any kind.  As it flew toward the north, it got dimmer and dimmer until it just vanished - like a match burning out.   I might surmise it was a meteor; but it was below the cloud deck and unobscurred.  A meteor at such a low altitude would be moving extremely fast.  This object moved at a rate similar to an airplane we saw concurrently! coming from the east, and at a higher altitude.

((NUFORC Note:  One of approximately 20 sighting reports from the same source, over the course of approximately seven weeks.  PD)) SIGHTING #15 – July 27, 2013 – 8th SIGHTING OF A “UGO” My friend “Carol,” who lives on the northern end of Sanibel Island, FL, called me this morning to tell me that at 10:20 p.m. last night she was out on her top porch and saw the now quite mysterious white glow again – the Unidentified Glowing Object (one of these nights we hope to the actual object that is creating this light).  She had been on her porch for about 5 minutes before the sighting.   This is the sixth sighting of this glow that she’s had (see my previous “Sighting” reports).   She said it was in the same location at the previous ones we and she have seen – not much more than a half mile away, to the WNW, just on the other side of the seaward tree line of clam Bayou, and very close to the water or beach.   She also said that “whatever is making these lights HAS to be really big, or really bright….just no way any kind of a flashlight could make that kind of a glow.”  I have to agree.  Also, as I stated before, the last time Carol had seen the glow, I was looking from ! a different spot and no one was out there with a flash light.  The glow came on and went out as before, as if on a dimmer switch, and this time stayed on for a “good minute.”  She said that it was as bright as she has ever seen it.  After about 5 minutes, it came back on, but not as bright, and only stayed on for a “few long seconds.”  She had the bravery this time to stay on her porch by herself for another 15 minutes or so, but saw nothing more.  Interesting is the timing of not just this event, but all of them – within a relatively short window, from 9:50 to 10:30 p.m.  I still have the now strong feeling that SOMETHING BIG IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN ON OUR SLEEPY LITTLE ISLANDS!

With a small digital camera, I recorded photos and video.  Samples of photos and video will, as in previous sightings I have reported, be provided via e-mail/links to NUFORC for review. During the sighting two other witnesses joined me for at least a portion of the time:  (1) another resident of the house (the son of the landlord), and (2) a maintenance person who was returning from an errand to complete a sink repair in my home.  I pointed the object out to them.  We were all perplexed. The object was not stationary, but moved around in the sky for about 50 minutes, varying in brightness, altitude and relative visibility. A local UFO reporting / research group (to which I belong) agreed that the object does not appear to be a balloon or star.  I believe the following could also be ruled out:  airplane, helicopter, standard drone, plastic bag, glider, satellite, bird, toy/kite, blimp. NOTE: At the end of the sighting, chemtrail activity was observed to begin.  It is unclear as to whether this could have been related to the observed incident.  A separate 2009 sighting I reported (which included similar activity) resulted in the NUFORC informing me that chemtrail activity appears not to be a real phenomenon.  Again, as in 2009, it is not my intention to debate the topic of chemtrails, but rather to report the details of the crafts / orbs I observe.  These reports sometimes include airplane activity during or after the event that creates visible contrails or ""chemtrails.""  SAMPLE PHOTOS AND VIDEO LINK WILL BE SENT TO NUFORC.

They're hover exact same area & do not move I simply want to share that every night, during all dark hours, since August 2012 and longer, I have seen these very same triangular or possibly Chevron form of white lights.  They hover in the exact same locales in the atmosphere.  You see them every night, at any time of night.  They are in the exact same locales, and the lights at first seemed to be idle, then as I watched longer intervals of time each night, I noticed the lights seem to be slightly pulsing.. only enough to notice that they are actually pulsating.  Then, withing the last week, a few nights ago, I noticed they were blinking erratically.  Blinking at fast intervals.. they seem to be ""aligned"" in the shape of the ""object"" and they seem to pulsate in a consecutive order. They seem to be at only a slightly higher level in the atmosphere as to what I see airplanes flying at night.  I've noticed airplanes flying in the lower vicinity of the atmosphere and wonder if they are noticing this as well.  As they seem to go right past the objects, yet at a lower level.  I've also wondered if there are satellites in the sky that send signals for towers and internet, etc.. yet I have no clue.. One thing I am sure of though, is that they've not been there forever. I was also curious if it could be some sort of lights for airlines as I live within 30-40 miles of the airport and the planes fly a bit lower in the atmosphere here. All said and done.. these objects ""hover"" in an idle position, they never move and are in the exact same area of the atmosphere.. every night, all night they are visible due to their lights..  Ever since I had seen them blinking erratically a few days ago, they have continued to blink, or rather pulsate consecutively in a more noticeable and faster motion. I tried to find a patter in the numerous objects I am spotting, as they are very near to each other.. yet I can only see so far above the housing and trees.. Trying to see if I noticed them being all part of one larger pattern, yet I cannot see a pattern, One object seems to be alone, then I have seen three ""sets"" where two are very near to each other and both pulsating.  And then by one of these sets..  there is another one.. that really stands out in comparison to all of the others.. as if it is much, much closer in the atmosphere. I've tried to take photos, yet I only have a small personal camera and camera phone, and the lights all captured as a solid blur.  It is really starting to get to me, I am wanting to get captures of this and wishing I had a camera that could capture them. I've shown them to other family members after telling them about them.. to assure that I had not been seeing things.. and they admit to seeing these objects being visible to them in the same manner as they are to me. I am to the point that I want to go and rent a professional camera to try to capture them.  I want to show everyone what it is I am seeing every night for over half of a year now.. or longer.. They hover these areas every night, I can see them high in the atmosphere, when standing on the porch, or sidewalk or curbside in front of the house.  I look across the street above the neighbors house, and there is one always above the stack on their roof.   Then looking straight up from the sidewalk at curbside, facing the house, I see a ""set""  with another one that is brighter and seems near to the set, yet lower in the atmosphere, then facing SW I see one above the trees in the backyard, and then more towards east, I see two more, then facing NW I see another one. The objects are, of course, as mentioned before, higher in the atmosphere than airplanes flying over, yet they are equally visible as the airplanes, if not more.. especially very recently, and since the past week or so, when noticing the lights beginning to pulsate more erratically. I'm anxious to be able to expose them to others, and wishing I had a camera to take photographs, that can capture them.. as I said, my family are seeing them as well..

Me and a friend were sitting in my backyard listening to a cd and counting the shooting stars we saw as we did the year before. We started watching the meteor shower around 11pm counting a few dozen each. Like a competition.  Then around 3:30 or 4am my friend said ""what the..."". I saw him pointing to the sky. And i saw it and said ""what the heck"". ""Its a huge chunk of metal"". It was travelling slowly, had no propeller, no wings, was greyish, and i remember saying ""it has right angles"". It had no lights, but even in the dark sky it was easily visible.  This thing was totally silent, it just floated by. It was so low, it seemed only 4 or 5 telephone poles above the ground. I took out my smart phone and quickly tried to load an app called 'space junk', an app that tracks satellites in real time using GPS. After fumbeling with it for a couple seconds we both just watched as it passed over my house. For some reason, i thought it could have been a satellite that fell out of orbit. We talked about it in disbelief for at least an hour afterwards. It was an exciting and t! errifying experience. My friend said he wished he never saw it. Anyways ive been trying to find out anything about it since then. Like how to obtain radar data. I cant find any info. I would like to remain anonymous. We never told anyone because unless you were there, its totally unbelievable. Before that night i didnt doubt their existance, but was skeptical about claims people make because of all the hoaxes. But i will never forget that night and whenever i think about it, i get kinda scared. It was so close, and that night we described it as being at least the size of a house or apartment building. Im just trying to find answers, and i dont care what anyone says. What we saw was not lights from a distance, or some shabby camera work, it was low, so low you could almost make out seams in the metal, or whatever it was made of. Anyways, publish this if you wish, but either way im always still gonna be searching for answers, for personal validation.

All of a sudden he slows a down to stop and says, 'look at that'. I looked up, and could barely process what I had just seen. It was a massive, bright, white, and fast moving object. Rectangular in shape. And moving at hundreds of mph!  One of the many things that hit me about this craft, was it appeared to be moving right over our town, and low, at an unimaginable speed, yet it never made one sound. I would say it was the size of a football field, at least.  And then it just disappeared into the clouds.

I decided as I saw it coming to not try to use my phone cam or run to get a cam, I decided to observe the best I could and it passed so close that I got a really good look at it.  The flickering of the orange light seemed to appear as a distortion of some kind, not fire, and I could see a structure inside. I could not see the structure well but I very well saw straight lines of a structure, a few straight lines parallel to each other.  It was perfectly round as it appeared round coming towards me, above me, and leaving me. I can only guess, but I think the flickering is a time or space distortion and perhaps that is its propulsion system. It made absolutely no noise at all.

Hi, I live in Capalaba Qld in Australia. Me and my wife had a couple of friends around to celebrate New Year's Eve with us. Shortly after 10pm we ran out of coke so me and my friend decided to walk to the BP service station which is just behind our house. As we made our way we observed 2 orange lights steadily moving from the direction of Victoria point towards the back of our house. I am unsure if the light was actual light of the moon light reflecting on the surface of the crafts. They did not flash or make any noise (but did seem to shimmer slightly) and maintained the same distance from each other constantly. As they moved out of sight one of the lights faded away. When we returned my wife and My friends partner told us they had seen them too but observed 3 lights instead of 2. We didn't know what to think and left it at that. But, shortly after midnight, about 12:04 we saw the lights again, 3 of them in a triangular formation coming from the same direction.  Again they moved so silently and softly maintaining the same distance from each other.  We were facing towards Victoria point with a clear sky and the moon bright and up to our left.  It was when these objects moved underneath the moon that we were convinced that they were alien crafts.  The light from the moon cast down on top of them revealing three huge disc shaped crafts with what appeared to be a hard metallic surface.  It was hard to tell how high they were but they seemed quite low. Possibly the height a news chopper would fly at. I can say with up most certainty that they were not planes or helicopters, hot air balloons, weather balloons or any other man made craft. I have seen all of these things numerous times throughout my life and they look nothing like what we saw that night. Feel free to ask me any questions that you may have about our sighting. Kind Regards",2013-05-15T00:00:00,,

My family and I were on a trip to the state of Western Australia in January this year.   We had driven for several days from Melbourne, and one of our stops was in a small town just over the border of Western Australia.  Later that evening at the camp site, just after 9pm,I was standing outside, a few meters away from our caravan where the rest of my family were asleep, with my phone using a star map to look at the constellations.   I remember it was a very clear night with no clouds, buildings or airports for kilometers.   On the star map, I was facing north east. I was holding my phone above my head so I could track what was on the screen to what was in the sky.   I looked away from my phone, and in the sky directly above me, two rows consisting of about 3 blue, white and red coloured lights running parallel blinked in and out and moved across the sky in an easterly (left to right) direction until the lights morphed into only one row and flattened out to be horizontal, which spun and blinked in and out of view and then looked as though it did a hook turn and was coming straight for me before a tree blocked view and the object disappeared.  It looked as though it got bigger when it was heading in my direction.  It had been so real that I screamed and started crying.  I ran straight back to our caravan and woke up my parents.  It had been a solid shape because the outline had been clearly visible and the stars had been blocked.  It couldn't have been an airplane because it was completely silent and completely disappeared from view.  It was also to large to be an airplane,and also had too many lights.  My first thought in that moment of  shock was that it had been some kid playing with a toy UFO,then it registered to me what I had just seen.  I'm not sure if there is any other explanation to what I saw, but I believe it had been a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was not prepared for what I saw.  Because I was in the passenger seat, I was able to follow the object as it passed by.  Initially it appeared to be a flamelike aura.  As it came closer I noticed three equidistant non-flashing white lights on a slight angle, surrounded by a dark shadow against the cloudy night sky.  The laser-like fire appeared to be pulsating around the lights and shadowy form, moving from front to back.  We followed it, as it passed and I noticed that it made a semi-circular turn toward the west. 	Some of the cars behind us seemed to have turned to follow it.  My head was hanging out of the window when my wife turned to me and said, take a picture.  I did not react quickly enough and was paralyzed in amazement.

We hadn’t been out long when I asked my husband where the binoculars were, which he said he would get them.  I spent a few moments looking at Mars and Saturn and a few deep sky objects.  Shortly after 10 PM I decided to put the binoculars back in the garage, and just as I turned toward the door I noticed a bright orange ball of light coming up over the southern horizon traveling east.  I pointed it out to my husband and asked what it was.  At first my mind tried to make sense of the sight, thinking it was a helicopter or plane on fire, but it made no sound at all.  After a moment I realized the binoculars were still around my neck, and I looked at the! object, seeing only a perfectly round ball of deep orange light.  The color flickered like a flame into different shades of orange, but it remained constantly lit.  It never blinked or made any sort of pattern.  It was hard to judge how big or how far away it was, but it was slow-moving and appeared to be low in the sky, its path a relatively straight line.  I handed the binoculars over to my husband and ran into the house hoping to get my camera ready, but by the time I made it back it had disappeared.  It just “faded out” as my husband described it, and he wondered if maybe it just disappeared behind the clouds, so we went up into the yard hoping to see it again, but we never did.

I filmed two video segments and took several still photos. I had a hard time judging the size and distance to the object which was moving much slower than a meteor and not near as bright.  It was also gaining altitude not losing it. I think it was only about the size of a basketball and probably only a few hundred feet away.  There was no sound or noise coming from the object that I could hear. It did remind me of a chinese lantern or little hot air balloon but it appear to be a perfectly round ball with a pulsating light in the exact center and not a candle at the bottom as you would expect from a lantern. The object moved diagonally across my westerly path and gained altitude.  Shortly after it crossed in front of the moon it disappeared. Its speed seemed to be slower than an airplane but it is hard to judge exactly how fast it was going because it was hard to tell how far away and how big it was.  If it was the size of basket ball and only a few hundred feet away then I would guess its speed to be about 10 mph.  I am sure it was not a real airplane, helicopter nor toy or models size version.

Had intelligence I was driving down Colorado Blvd going back to my sisters house when out of the corner of my eye I saw something with lights hovering above the church on 38th. I did a u-turn on 40th and turned on 38th then stopped.  I recorded it on my sisters cell phone. While recording I noticed that the object was not showing up on the screen even though I was looking right at it.  I then stopped a guy that was walking and asked him if he saw it. He said ""ya you mean that square thing with the lights, it looks like a kite""  It was NOT a kite. It was 2:30am. I then left and drove the short distance to my sisters.  I told her about it. When I told her it was still there when I left she wanted to go see if it was still there.  We drove back to that area and it was there hovering above the church.  We stopped on 38th and sat there bewildered as to what this object was.  My sister told me to drive under it. 02 Apprehensively I decided to drive down the alley just after the ! parking lot of the church.  As we maneuvered south down the alley the object hovered above but even with the car as it moved. When we reached 37th I turned left and stopped.  The object was hovering over 37th. As we were stopped a truck passed us and pulled over to see what we were looking at. They saw the object and thought it was peculiar.  They went about their business. My sister was trying to photograph the object (which we both concluded looked like a red transparent bubble with bluish white lights that seemed to be eyes.)   When the flash went off the object hovered/floated behind some trees as if it were trying to hide. I backed up down the street so we could see it.  I then decided to see if it would ""follow"" us and drove back up the street and it did indeed stay in close proximity to the car.  We parked in the church parking lot and got out. It was not threatening in anyway, just odd.  The two guys in the truck drove back by, saw us still looking and pulled into the parking lot.  The four of us could not determine what it ! was.  It did somewhat resemble a balloon so one of the guys tried to locate where a string was that would be tethering the object and was unsuccessful. Meanwhile my sister called her boyfriend and he showed up.  He too was baffled as to what this floating/hovering object could be.  The two guys in the truck left and my sister, her boyfriend and I just watched.  It seemed to be looking at us with the lights.  The lights moved as if it were thinking or computing.  I'm not sure of the correct word... It had intelligence.  By the time we left it was 4:00am and the object never went out of sight.  We left it, it didn't disappear.  During this time we also saw 2 what seemed to be stars go from standstill to across the sky.  It was like they took it out of park and moved quickly across the entire sky.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,39.74512637220715,-104.95934593826682

It was approximately 6:35pm (18:35) CST. I glanced up because I saw movement, and was facing due north.  I saw a commercial airliner, like a 737, that was flying eastward, from near the center of my field of view.  I watched it fly for a second, following the vapor trail backwards. When I reached the end of the vapor trail, I noticed an egg-shaped object hovering, just to the left of center, and a little higher than the original flight path of the plane. The egg-shaped object had an aura, or shadow, or pulse, to or about it. Within a blink of an eye, 2 orbs (circular) appeared just to the right and higher of the egg-shaped object. The egg-shaped object had a grayish or metallic appearance, while the orbs had a brighter white glow. The egg-shaped object was larger than the commercial airliner. It was larger in diameter, and similar to the difference in size depicted in the picture. The orbs were very similar in scale to the picture, as is the jet. The main object began to move westward, and had erratic movement. In my excitement,  I evaluated everything in a brief second.  I did not have a quality video camera, and feared that a cell phone picture would provide poor quality, and little details.  I made a decision to go for binoculars, in hopes of being able to see the object better. I ran for the binoculars, returning and seeing all three objects.  The plane was gone by now. At that instant, the orbs disappeared.  I threw the binoculars up to my eyes, and was not able to immediately locate the object.  I pulled them down to re-gain a fix on its location again, found it with my naked eyes, and watched it enter into the clouds. If it appears on any radar, it would be very close to the Alabama Tennessee state line, at about 6:35pm, on Monday, July 29th, 2013. I have attempted to re-create what I saw.  The picture should explain the movement, location, and surrounding view point.  The picture is pretty close to what I saw.
