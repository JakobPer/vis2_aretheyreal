A coworker and I had two experiences while visiting Prescott Arizona on business.  The first is reflected on the report above, while the second occurred the following evening closer to Phoenix, on the way back to Phoenix to spend the night before flying home to Georgia and North Carolina. The first occurred on the night of the 13th.  My coworker and I were walking back to the Spring Hill Suites from a restaurant.  The Christmas crowd had gone home for the evening as we walked passed the Palace Restaurant.  We paused to take a photo of the historic restaurant.  Neither of us noticed the shape above the Palace in the night sky.  I found it on the photo the next day and will email it to you.  We both agree that we didn't see it at the time but it does not appear to be a photo flash.  The shape is a very distinct saucer-shaped object. The second strange experience was during our drive to Phoenix on the 14th.  At approximately 20:30, we noticed three very large lights hovering over the mountains on the western horizon.  The three lights were in a triangular pattern; with the one in the middle being just above the horizon and the outside two were evenly spaced on either side, higher up in the sky.  I watched them from the car for at least 10 miles before bringing the lights to my co-worker's attention.  We continued to watch them.  They were spaced what seemed to be approx 1 mile apart or more. They were very large. They could not have been stars or aircraft. As we reached Pappadeux restaurant, we noticed one light disappeared, followed by a second.  The third, lower light hovered over the mountain as we entered the restaurant.  It was gone when we came out after dinner.",2013-12-23T00:00:00,34.63572068965517,-112.5686275862069

It was 3 to 4 feet wide.   The reason I'm reporting  this is because after seeing this it reminded me of an experience I had a couple years ago, around 1am.  I was biking down Blount street toward the High Noon Saloon.  When I was on the sidewalk next to the MG&E coal castle I was engulfed in a green light or laser that was coming from quite a distance as I could tell the laser was breaking up around me.  I stopped my bike, and the green light stopped.  besides the Christmas similarities I find it rather disturbing.  I don't think it's alien in nature.   Another Madison experience I had about 6 to 8 years ago, we were sitting in my living room with the windows open when we heard a deafening wooshing sound.  It was spring or fall and lasted for 20 seconds.  Quite a while and was reported in the paper. I nev! er heard a conclusion I think the lights are Taran of nature... now the big question... why me?

Suddenly, we both realized it couldn’t be a star, because it was moving at an extremely high speed, in an easterly direction.  We tried to follow it visually as we exited off the highway at the Motter Road exit. Turning right onto Motter Road, we crossed a little bridge, and pulled immediately into the empty parking lot of a veterinary office on the right, overlooking Rt. 15.  We could still just barely make out whatever it was we were seeing as it disappeared into the east. Suddenly, we all noticed directly overhead, two more objects, triangular shaped, all with flashing lights around them.  They were also heading east, but crossing over each other in very close proximity. Then, from the north, we saw one more triangular shaped object, also with flashing lights, heading southeast.  It seemed like it was catching up to the other objects. Finally, we saw one object north east of our position, that just stayed stationary.

Object was moving at a very high speed, but deliberately changed course at least 3 times, also at very high speed. Object also dimmed out and became bright again, as if responding to spotlight. Object was amongst the star field, yet seemed slightly lower.  Object also pulsed a yellowish-white when signaling back to my spotlight. Object ended up on a northerly heading, blacking out before dipping below horizon. Object was not an aircraft, nor a satellite, or the ISS.

The light hovered at times, but also appeared to travel, changing directions at random. As I got closer to the light, I rolled down my window so that I could get a better look at it.  I could make out no details other than the fact there was a blue light maneuvering above the road.  Eventually, I passed under it and as far as I could tell, the light was around 50 feet directly over the road. Traffic was heavy in the area so I couldn't take my eyes off the road for too long.  It seems likely that other people saw it, too. I think the most logical explanation for what I saw is a remote-controlled hobbyist's aircraft such as a helicopter or quad-copter.  Due to traffic noise, I couldn't make out the sound of a motor, but the perceived altitude and way that the light moved made me think of an R/C craft.

I must say, I'm quite intelligent and well experienced in life.  I'm NOT crazy.  I can't explain this.  It happened.   Okay, so here I am walking from the main house to a storage room at the south end of my property.  I noticed what I believed to be was a satellite going from NE to SW.  I grew up spending my summers on Mobile Bay, far from the city lights.  Nothing but a blanket of diamonds above me.  I've seen thousands of satellites quietly move across the night sky, always giving me a slight thrill of exhilaration.  So, I slowed my pace to watch it.  I'd say it was 50° from the horizon when an orange light appeared, heading straight for it from the opposite direction.   This is when I stopped dead in my tracks.  My hairs were standing (standing now just thinking of it).  The lights cross! ed paths.  The orange light continued while the 1st light (bluish white) LOCKED on the brakes, immediately halting, changed directions and pursued the other.  I was now back pedaling w/my eyes tearing up but never looking away.  I was scared.  I was REALLY scared.   The bluish light eventually stopped and fixed into the sky like a star.   The orange continued to the northeast.  As it passed directly above me, a white light from the ESE approached, crossed paths, and made like a star as the other.  The orange light kept going until out of sight.   That's when I ran inside.  My wife could tell something was up as soon as she saw me.  I could barely speak.  I've only shared this story with a handful of others.  I honestly can't explain it.  Military exercise?  A war above us?  Perhaps a few visitors taking pics of the silly humans and their oil spill...who knows?   It happened.  I'm just glad that I was able to witness it.  To have this drawn into my memory.   Hope this helps!",2014-04-11T00:00:00,30.839499999999997,-88.0968

At first, I did not think much of it, thought it was radio towers, but as we passed, I realized and looked back and realized that tower lights are usually red or white and they blink.  They looked very close and bright.  We knew where we were, and knew we never seen them before.  When we came back in daylight there are no towers of any kind. It bothers me to this day, what I seen.  The route we take is State Game lands and not a busy area.  I have always read about UFO hanging around military installations.  Fort Indiantown Gap not far from where we had seen these orange orbs.

My friend saw something in the sky and made a joke about the area being a no fly zone so we all looked up to see what it was.  It was far away and we all saw very bright blue and red lights on the object. It was just hovering and then it quickly went down diagonally to the left then went right.  We thought that was odd and then it just slowly dropped straight down. After about ten minutes of waiting for it to come back up we gave up.  Me and my roommate went to walk to the gas station (also the direction of where it went down at) and the others went inside.  On our way back from the gas station we saw a disc shaped object overhead flying past us.  At first we didn't hear anything but later as it was way past, almost hard to still see it, we heard it loud and clear and it seemed as it was right above us although nothing was in the sky except the disc and it was far past us by then. We assumed it broke the sound barrier…  When we got back we met up with one of the other people that went inside earlier.  As we were sitting at the table again I was staring at the sky and our of nowhere I saw the first bright light flying object again.  I pointed it out to them and this time it was a lot closer.  It was extremely bright with alternating green blue and red lights.  Sometimes you could see all of the lights at once and sometimes they were all one color.  It had a very strange flight pattern and was just hovering for 5-10 minutes and going in strange directions.  Eventually it slowly went down again just like the first thing we saw. As we were watching it our friend was coming back from the library and we pointed it out to him and turned a non believer into a believer. I got one low quality picture of it when it was far away. I tried taking a video of it but my phone (which was at 40%) died.  I got a short video where you can see a light hovering and you can slightly see change of color in the lights.  But after about fifteen seconds of hovering it started taking off going diagonally up and to the right and my phone died and said I needed to connect to power.  Eventually I plugged my phone in and the battery was instantly back to 41% (assuming that was just an odd coincidence but my phone has never done that before… weird)  We waited for about a half hour to see it again but we never saw it come back up.  There was absolutely no possible it was a plane or helicopter… we couldn't relate it to anything we saw before.  We were in awe.",2014-04-11T00:00:00,41.13534566929134,-81.32625118110236

I turned around and looked directly out our picture window and I saw a craft up close between our neighbor's house and ours stationary, hovering between the two buildings.  I could not believe what I was seeing, the craft was maybe ten feet away from me.   I knew it was hiding, but I did not understand from what.   I watched it and got a good detail of the underside of it.  I was like it was semi on its side due to the space confinement between the two houses.  No sound came from it and it had three lights on its belly that were white.  The body was metallic, silver like.   I could not believe I was seeing, and afterwards, it slowly took off and it did so slowly and upward, with not sound.   After the event, I got on the phone to my mom who lives about a half a block away and told her what happened.  She said she did not see anything, but heard military jets flying around.  We both thought that was really usual because we never hear military jets in our residential area.   Days after the event, I drew many pictures of what I saw and I will never forgot the incident.

In the middle of an argument, she got my full attention by questioning the source of a light approaching our direction.  As it got closer it appeared to be in the shape of a green orb traveling on the ground with a small, bright light following maybe 5 feet above the green orb.  The shade of green was flourescent.   There is a strip of land behind the fence of my backyard which runs parallel to my house, which is where the subject was moving.  The situation was very strange because the object was completely silent.   What's even more strange is the fact that my dog was sitting next to the fence facing me and my girlfriend (and my house) and did not sense whatever was behind it and considering the time of night there are no other loud noises outside to counteract against the movement of the object behind my dog.   Directly behind my dog was a big bush (the bush is behind the fence) and a clear spot right after the bush until th! eres another bush, however the point is that there is a perfectly clear spot where I can see the object is going to come out.  When the object finally reached that point I could see clearly that this wasn't an orb but a tall, linky body that was glowing green from head to toe.  The object was so bright, from when we initially saw it, that it could only be identified as a blob of light.  The subject then continued down the strip of land (following underneath the powerlines) until it reached the elementary school playground.  Obviously you can see the playground from my backyard, however here I saw an array of lights moving frantically in an oval movement and then the array of lights formed back into the original green flourescent light and it zipped off into a nearby trail at an astounding rate of speed.  A period of approximately 5 minutes went by until we spotted the bright light that was initially trailing behind the orb above all the tall brush (about 13-15 feet high).  It was approaching our line of vision again just the opposite way this time, however this time it was making a strange vibrating sound.  Once it got about 30-40 yards from my girlfriend and I, we headed for the front of my house because this thing approaching us sounded unpleasant.   I honestly had seen enough and knew that it was nothing human and I did not want to stick around and possibly get hurt.",2014-04-11T00:00:00,33.95629913473424,-84.01987614338691

I missed where this object was ascending from or flight path it was taking before this, it was just there is all I can say.

I had been watching what one would assume were military aircraft flying back and forth over the western sky of SE Iowa.  There were at least a dozen of them.  They were very large with one main running light pattern.  They had very bright lights like on the wing tips and either red or white blinking lights.  But there were varied flash rates.  Some of the jets had a shape of a F15, all of them had glowing white rear parts of the engines.  They did not increase in brightness during acceleration and could be seen from any angle from my position. Now several of them were flying a rectangular pattern in the west horizon, as I was watching with my binoculars I noticed they were flying very fast.  But they would make very abrupt 90 deg turns, way to abrupt for their speed.  Then several were flying east to west and west to east directly over head.  One was flying a  north to south and back in a rectangle pattern.  When he changed his course to the west of the rectangle as it turned there was a distinct triangle pattern to its white lights, with a blinking red light in the middle.  This went on for a half an hour.  It was some really strange maneuvers like I have never seen before. The two jets came out of the south escorting a shinny object that looked like a large satellite moving the same speed of the jets and through the rectangle pattern the one jet had been flying.  They went across the horizon and my view would be about 30 to 40 deg of the horizon.  After the objects went out of view, all the jets split up.  Some them were playing and chasing each other.

On January 19, 2014, I awoke for some odd reason with a desire to go outside.  It was 4:47AM and I went outside to our picnic table and was looking around the sky and noticed this light in the western sky. I knew it was not a star or planet, as I'm a amateur astronomer.  I watched the light which was white in color and then noticed it slowly disappeared, it then came back for about 15-20 seconds and disappeared.  At that point I ran back into my home and got my video camera and tripod. I videotaped the object and for about 27 minutes.  During this time the object I believe may have landed, but I'm not sure.  I do know that there was something on the ground that was flashing in a consistent manner, it was something that was not there when I first started looking at the sky as there was nothing flashing before I noticed the light in the sky. I have never experienced anything like this before, but I do go out there nightly because this area off highway 87 has strange things in the sky so I make it a point to try and find something. One important thing of note is that I copied this video to post on YouTube.com, but what's strange is that the audio is choppy.  I've never had a problem with this camera, but if you watch the video at the end you can see a daylight shot which I took at 7AM in which my dog is in it and you can hear me speak normally.  I think that the object I was video taping was actually interfering with the camera.  Here is the YouTube link:  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XVmSmEzi8RI",2014-01-24T00:00:00,29.2739,-97.7557

Then it split into 4 crafts, and lights up, and then back to one.  Then one last time into five crafts and back to one.  It easily followed us up till we were at Beautty, NV. I flashed my lights at it in a 3,4,5 method.  The one craft lit up.  We then seen it move over us.  Just when we were about to enter Beautty, NV, the truck became lit up by a yellow neon dim light. I can assure you I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I am not saying it is alien, but I am not able to indentify it. Myself I am a real estate investor and business owner.  My 95 year old military AF veteran father was in the car and seen it, along with my son at 25 who works on our family business. I was traveling in a F 350 2012. I do not drink, do drugs, or take medicine of any kind.  I can assure you I am not trying to waste your time.  Later that evening upon arriving at my home in Las Vegas, I told my business partner and friend, a military veteran of 20 years by the way.  All of my family heard like a loud whisper that night. I did not sleep very well at all as I kept watch over everyone.",2014-02-07T00:00:00,38.0672,-117.2301

On the morning of March 28th, 2014 at about 1:00 AM I went for a walk near my home in Laveen, AZ.  I was looking to the NW, when I saw a slow-moving solid green light proceeding to the east.  It gradually turned a solid red, but only for a few moments before returning to a solid green again at which point it began to gradually descend until it dropped below the tree line and houses in the distance obstructing my view. A few moments later the green light emerged, but from a different point along the tree line and began proceeding slowly at an angle (up and to the left) before making an arch after which it descended down disappearing below the trees and houses all over again. About a minute later it emerged from yet another point on the horizon, still moving slowly, but this time moving up and down vertically, over and over again, bouncing above and below the trees and homes in the distance until it descended for the last time not to emerge again. The object appeared to be far way, at a distance of at least several miles or more, this would be my approximation. This whole episode lasted about 5 minutes.",2014-04-04T00:00:00,33.3054,-112.1997

UFO Report  I am writing this down for the first time in my life.  I am 57 yrs old, these things I swear by all that matters are true and did happen to the best of my recollection over the course of my life in Corpus Christi, Texas. 1st contact with strangeness: 	The summer of 1967 was very hot, muggy as I recall.  One day in june or July of that year 3 men dressed in black suits, white shirt, black ties and black sunglasses appeared (actually I saw them walk up the steps)on front porch screen door.  They knocked and stood very erect and still together, they looked like candles as recall, they were not the same height, but they were very thin, tall and very white.  Their hair was white or blond and appeard plastered to their heads with wavy plastered curles on their foreheads. 	I came to the door and asked what they wanted.  One of them bent down and stuck his nose close to the screen door at eye-level with me (I was 10 yrs old) and asked me…”where are your parents?”  I told him that my folks were at work and he said….”well they should be home, tell them we came looking for them.”  This was sorta not done in a nice manner and rather scared me.  My big sister (she was 13 yrs old) and I her room, I backed away from the door and yelled out her name to come to the door.  The turned around t walk down the steps to their car, a long black Lincoln or what looked like a crown Victoria.  I turned to look to see if my sister was coming to door, when I turned around back to the screen door to look down the porch at them men walking to their car to get in it, they weren’t there, they and the car were gone.  I never saw them get in car, I never heard the car start, nor did I ever see the car drive away down the street. 2ND EVENT:  	Over the course of the next year or so, 1967 to 1968, my parents, mainly my dad, began complaining about a pain in his heel.  Eventually, he had me look at his right foot heel for some sort of splinter or spur that he thought was stuck in his heel.  My dad had me probe his heel with needle where he thought the pain was.  I did this over the course of several weeks looking for this thing my dad thought he had in his heel.  Eventually, I was able to dig out of my dad’s heel this chip or sliver of metal, it was thin and small but very visible.  It was metal or at least had glint like metal, aluminum.  A few months later, my dad removed a piece of metal from my mom’s heel and my sister’s heel.  I had one in my foot pad that I took out, too. 3RD EVENT:  	In the summer of 1970, August 3rd, Corpus Christi was devastated by hurricane Celia, it wiped out the city, martial law was imposed, the National Guard shot and killed 9 looters over the course of the next two months.  We were without power or electricity until mid-October of that year.  Soon after power was restored, one night in my outside my bedroom window, late at night, very bright red and blue lights appeared in backyard.  The lights moved up and down through a very heavily branched cedar tree.  I didn’t get up out of bed because I was way too scared to see.  Later that night, I woke up and I am not sure if I was hallucinating and seeing small little people with big fat heads and very big eyes in room looking around.  I put the covers over head and wished they would go away.  Nothing else happened then I fell asleep. 4TH EVENT:  	Summer, July 1976, cabinis field Baseball Park.  Divisional game between Carroll high and king high.  Skylab is in orbit.  During the middle of game the PA announcer who is calling the ball game, says that skylab will be visible to the crowd (about 2500people) as it makes its orbit around earth.  The PA announcer knows the exact time and the direction from which skylab will appear from the horizon, I believe he told everyone to look to the southeast of cabinis field, as I looked up to the ‘clear blue sky’, directly out of the south in clear view came an object it was cylindrical, dark and gray, had no markings, some external equipment and crooked arm sticking out of it with red glowing bulb at the end of the crooked arm.  It was clearly visible, the PA announcer and another man in the booth began to argue about the object and it begin too low and not coming from the correct direction.  The object came directly over the ball field, not more than a few hundred to a thousand feet, it! s details were very visible to me.  The men in the PA booth of the ballpark continued to argue over the loud speaker about the object finally the head PA announcer said to drop it, nothing more was said. I remember going down the stands to the concession stand and people looking bewildered and dazed.  I got in my car and drove home in disbelief. Over the following years, I had no more interesting events happen to me, things were quiet and calm, but from time to time I have events of precognition or clairvoyance were I find somewhat disturbing.  I have learned to control myself and these precognitive thoughts or clairvoyance and try to lead a good, better life.",2014-04-04T00:00:00,27.717500161812296,-97.40525129449838

Sunrise is a main road that runs east to west along the base of the Catalina Mountains and Swan (to the west of our apt) and Craycroft (to the east) are roads that run perpendicular north and south.  Tues night (3/4/14) at 7:39pm, my son was sitting on our third-floor, south-facing apt balcony.  From the balcony, which faces Sunrise, we have a panoramic view that includes city lights to the southwest, Davis-Montham/TIA lights to the south, and Tucson Mountains to west.   At around 7:39, my son noticed what appeared to be a large triangle-shaped ""craft"" with 3 point lights (spaced evenly apart in a straight line) along the back and a single light at what would be the point of the triangle or front of ""craft"".  This large, expansive-looking ""craft"" was moving slowly and silently at an angle over Swan heading northwest in the direction of I-10.   He immediately called me as he was watching it and I happened to be driving north on Craycroft towards Sunrise with a friend following two cars back.  All the way up Craycroft to the light at Sunrise (about 1 mile), I was unable to see anything and thought he was exaggerating.   However, as I turned left to go west on Sunrise, there it was up ahead directly in front of me up in the sky.  My view of it was of the back three lights only as it moved away from my direction, heading west over Sunrise.  I did not see the front point light.   A Pima County Sheriff's Supervisor SUV had been directly behind me at the Craycroft/Sunrise light and as soon he turned the corner behind me, he gave one blast of the siren, stomped on the gas, cutting around me and the car to the left, racing up Sunrise in that direction.   I reached home in about three minutes and it had already disappeared from my view.  My friend, who had been behind the Sheriif, had seen it as well as soon as we turned on Sunrise.

For another split moment I thought maybe it was some sort of fireball - such was the colour and shape.  However its movement seemed steady and the shape/size consistent. Also there appeared to be a very slight crescent glow (where the bright spot would be at the top centre of the crescent). The light traveled south and at first it seemed to be maybe nearing us slightly, but then appeared to travel away from us while still moving south.  Overall it was moving slowly - like an aircraft a few miles away.  Then it disappeared by fading out over a period of maybe 5 seconds (overall our sighting time might have been around 30 seconds - we didn't see it appear so don't know how long it was visible). There were no other lights around the orange 'ball' as we all wondered if it was the front lights (landing lights?) of an aircraft.  There is a private airport nearby that has small jets and other aircraft frequenting it.  The light however was definitely orange, not the clear/white we normally observe.  Also there were no accompanying flashing lights.  Also there was no sound; and it was a quiet evening. There were some clouds in the sky, however it was mostly clear in this area at the time.  There were stars visible in the sky.  Later in the evening at around 11:00 we went outside to watch the sky again, but clouds at that point covered almost all of the visible sky.  We ultimately thought that maybe it was one of those floating lanterns and landed on that conclusion.  Hopefully this information is helpful.",2014-01-10T00:00:00,26.19318196994992,-81.73703021702838

It was flying around the apartment buildings, through trees and at various heights.  I was walking my dog and the object would come over and hover over me.  It would then migrate very high very quickly.  It would go around buildings of which a simple toy could not have done due to no visibility when it would approach the back of the buildings.  I was watching it, but I could not see any person in the area.  I watched it for about 15 minutes, of which it came and hover over me again.

They were much higher up and over the sea to the north west of Marco (probably off the coast near Naples or Fort Myers).   They looked at first as if they were parachutes moving down towards the surface.  I realized that they could not be because they were too far out to sea and were very high up.  One appeared to be gray/black ant the other was a very bright light.  At first I thought the bright one was just the sun glinting off something.  I must have taken my eye off the for a second because then I saw both objects take off in a vertical direction out over the gulf at a high speed.  They were traveling in roughly a north west direction.  They appeared to stay the same distance apart with the black one a li! ttle lower and behind the bright one.  I watched them for several minutes as they disappeared into the distance.  It seemed like the light was unnaturally bright.

The object was circular. I next noted the object traveled near a round-shaped ""rain"" cloud. The object then disappeared into the cloud.  Birds do not do that.

As I neared the intersection with Ellery - Centralia road,I happened to look to the left out the driviers side window. I saw an object hovering in the air in the clear blue morning sky! It looked like it was hanging there motionless!  I pulled over and stopped to see what it was and to see if it really was motionless. Once I was stopped,I could see that this object was actually moving very,very slowly to the west. I got a pretty good look at it. It was roughly tadpole shaped with a little nub of some sort sticking out on one side. It was not at all smooth looking like a helicopter or plane.  It had a lot of angles all over it so it looked kind of lumpy. I'm mildly color blind,but this looked thing like the color of an old penny...metallic,but not very reflective at all. It had no wings, no windows, no propellers, no rotors, no landing gear and no markings of any kind. It kind of reminded me of a clenched fist where the knuckles were the angles mentioned above. This thing looked too bulky and non-aerodynamic to fly! It was at about the height where a helicopter would fly...low enough to see well. It was hovering over the part of Cassadaga swamp that curves around the end of the hill towards Stockton and Stockton State Forest.  I looked at it for a moment and asked myself ""What the hell is that?"" Lacking an answer (and a camera) and having time constraints,I moved on. I kept watching it through the trees until the terrain obscured it from my sight. As I entered the intersection with Ellery - Centralia road I looked back over my shoulder out the drivers side window. There was the object...looking the same...but now moving quite quickly toward where I had just come from. If I'd had a camera I would've probably turned left and tried to get some pictures of it. Who knows what might've happened then! (Even though it was April Fools day I don't think this thing could have been any kind of hoax! There's noone to prank out there over the swamp!)  I told a few people about this and,a few days later,this one lady said her husband works with someone who lives near there. She said that this person supposedly saw the same object on the same day I did. I dont know what time they saw it.  Over time,a lot of strange things have been seen around Cassadaga Swamp and the surrounding area! Some of those things have been reported on this very NUFORC website!",2014-04-18T00:00:00,,

We were staying right on the beach in the west end.  On Wednesday night, just after sundown, I went out to my balcony to watch the stars and smoke a cigarette.  I looked up and directly in front of my POV in the sky, which was the second floor of the hotel, was a bright, orange, glowing light like the color of Mars in the night sky.  First one, then multiple glowing “stars” appeared after about 30-45 minutes of the first one.  At first I thought it was a flare, but it was too big and didn’t arc and burn out and fall towards the gulf.  These lights would dim and then just disappear only to appear in a completely different spot from the previous one.  At one point, there was a glowing orange light to my left higher up in the sky and simultaneously one to my right slightly lower and seemed closer.  The one to the right split into 2 balls, and the one to my left split into 4 balls.  This happened several times.  The entire event l! asted about 4 hours.  Also, when the glowing orange “stars” would disappear, there would be blinking lights all around - sometimes one, other times 2-3.  They, too, would just disappear and then reappear somewhere else in the sky.  These “stars” didn’t move they just glowed and disappeared or multiplied then disappeared.  However, the last one of the night glowed brightly for about 15 minutes then split into two orange “stars” and started moving towards our building.  They turned into (?!?) flying vehicles with flashing red and white lights.  When they were overhead, they appeared to be boomerang shaped with the lights being on the bowed part which seemed to be the front of the vehicle.  There was no sound. We also saw this same night, in between the glowing orange “star” show, a triangular (right triangle) formation of three stars.  Then a forth one appeared in between the two stars that were farthest apart, for example a right triangle with “A” being the point, “B” and “C” being the points of the right angle.  This “D” point appeared between stars “A” and “B”.  A few minutes later, my son pointed out that the fourth star or “D”, which was not twinkling, was moving.  We watched it slowly move north, and then speed up once it was at what appeared to be a right angle to the right triangle.  It eventually flew over our building.  This object was made of white light, had no sound, and was maybe just outside of our atmosphere or miles into the upper atmosphere. The really strange thing is earlier that evening, just when the sun was above the horizon, I was sitting on the balcony watching seagulls attempting to catch their dinner when one of them flew straight up into the sky (very high) and then flew straight out towards the horizon.  Now there were no clouds in the sky and no fog.  I continued watching this bird as its behavior just seemed odd to me, until it flat disappeared in the middle of its flight to the horizon.  The first orange glowing “star” appeared where the seagull had disappeared. I took several pictures, but unfortunately, they’re not so great as my phone’s camera is really poor quality. Once the orange, glowing “stars” finished their “show”, we noticed about 30 minutes later a bright red light on the horizon actually on the water.  It was motionless for approximately 20-25 minutes.  All of a sudden, it took off across the horizon line at a tremendous speed.  It appeared to be hovering above the water.  I have grown up on the coast and have never seen anything that big move that fast.  The distance had to be at least 6-7 miles out and there was no sound.  It had red and white lights.  It got to a certain point coming all the way across the horizon line and disappeared. Whatever we witnessed, along with several other guests at the hotel, was like nothing I’ve ever seen (and I’ve seen the space station and satellites.  None of these objects or activities was even similar to what I’ve witnessed before.)",2014-04-18T00:00:00,30.289213333333333,-85.81383666666666

It was larger than any airplane I've seen and the brightness of the light was strong enough that I still saw an impression of it when I looked away.  It was an oval-like shape of light that did not pulsate or blink, but was was constant. Soon I noticed a green object that was almost the same, but slightly smaller and flying behind the first one.  They moved quickly in their trajectory and ""popped"" in and out of sight several times, reappearing in various locations (some times the same and some times different locations).  Once, when an airplane flew over from N to S (crossing over my head), they both disappeared and then reappeared after the airplane was out of their range!    Lastly, after they thoroughly swept the sky NW to NE, they reversed direction, moving further from my vantage point towards the horizon.  They did this multiple times until they disappeared over the horizon.  The blue one, on occasion, would turn a light purple color and even a dark red.   Near their disappearance, I was able to get a good enough sight of the green one through my binoculars.  I noticed that it consisted of a green core (an orb like shape) surrounded by several smaller red orbs that glowed dimly in comparison. The only ""strange"" appearance are several small black marks on my ankles.  This could, however, be ink from a pen, but for some odd reason I have not been able to remove these ""blots.""",2014-04-18T00:00:00,34.17941111111111,-84.1402945386064

Each individual red light was approximately twice the size of a usual star in the sky. Each set of three (3) lights was in a triangular configuration, one (1) light centered above (2) other lights.  Each set of lights was approximately twenty (20) to thirty (30) yards away from the next, and situated linearly from each other as if on the rim of a disc-shaped object, or down the side of a cylindrical or cigar-shaped object.  I could not actually see the shape of the object itself, I am approximating it's shape from the positions of the sets of lights.  My house faces North, and I was in my back yard facing East when I noticed the lights.  The object slowly moved in a North-by-Northeast direction, for less that twenty (20) seconds before it was blocked from my view by trees and houses.  My best estimate is that from the objects position when I first noticed it. It was approximately one (1) to one and a half (1.5) miles East of me, and approximately eight (8) to ten (10) inches above estimated horizon.

I looked from the back yard due west and saw something hovering emitting a rainbow of colors. It was somewhat static but seemed to hover in a random elliptical motion/manner.  I watched it for about 10 minutes and ran inside to get my sister she came out and then her fiancée we all stood there trying to figure what it was and confirmed it was not a satellite, balloon, helicopter, drone or anything known.  I wanted witnesses and confirm I wasn't crazy or seeing things. We all we perfectly sober for the record.  We could not debunk it.  I went back inside and got my binoculars (40x) and  my sister fiancée and I took turns looking at it.  We concluded it was exactly due west, very bright and was gradually either moving away slowly and/or downward.  We figure it was 50 to 100 miles away or so and from what we could tell it was triangular with three light source that seemed to be emitting from the points we think.  We figure it had to be massive because it was seemingly had to be since it was so far away and still seemed rather big.  As it either descended or flew off slowly it went out of view because the roof tops obstructed our line-of-sight. It fit the exact description my last landlord/friend described seeing a handful of times in the same area and about the same approximate time.  One night he said it came right over the house very low then shot off.  He said he went out cause all the neighbors dogs were going crazy. He went outside and everything went quiet.  He looked up and it was right over the house and it was bright, dead silent and huge!  He said the next-door neighbor came outside too to find out what the dogs were barking at and she saw it.  He asked if she saw it to confirm he wasn't crazy, and she said “Yeah!”  I never confirmed it with her, but I know who she is and their addresses.  At the time I was skeptical.  Now I totally believe him after this event!  If this was a hoax I have no idea how anyone could have made a vehicle do what it did or make so bright.  Kinda like a disco-tech hovering in the sky.  It kinda reminded me of a police car strobe light rack but it was spinning all different random colors.  I hoped it would just zip away into space so I could rule out a hoax.  Seemed legit to me!!!  Definitely an Unidentified Flying Object!",2014-01-30T00:00:00,,

At first I thought it was an aircraft, but the light emanating from the object didn’t flash in any recognizable pattern as one would expect from an airplane; my next thought was that it was a satellite because the flashes it was emitting were full spectrum, it seemed to be emanating all the colors one might expect to see in a rainbow, but this is where it started getting weird, the object started moving in a back and forth pattern very rapidly for a few moments; something I've never seen conventional aircraft or satellite do.  It would remain in place for a few minutes, moving in a whiplash back-and-forth movement, then it started to wander lazily in random directions, moving in a westerly direction over the span of about one-and-a-half hours before it disappeared from view.  I reported the lights to a ne! ighbor who also confirmed the lights and the same movement patterns I described.  We could not discern any shape, we could only see the flashing/flickering lights; we both described the light as brilliant, agreeing it was far too bright to be a star or a satellite.

It was clear skies.  I am very familiar with the area and there are no tall towers which would produce light. My first impressions were this was a plane.  However, the object did not appear to be moving, rather hovering and the shape was unusual and the lights very bright and peculiar.  I slowed my vehicle as I got to the object and got a good look.  Now I could see detail and was very sorry I didn't have a camera as I would have snapped a photo showing a clearly shaped black triangle with three lights at the corners, blue and red and white.  The object was standing still mid-air about 100 yards above me and almost directly overhead.  There was no sound and the lights were slowly blinking, although dimming off and on would be a better description. At this point I was stopped, outside my car and looking up at the object.  I was the sole vehicle in the area at that specific time.  The object was pulsing back and forth between a sort of luminous, transparency and solid, black as if it was materializing and de-materializing at the pulse rate of about once every two seconds. After a couple minutes, I became a little nervous being alone and with the object so close. I got in my car and left.  The detail against clear skies left no doubt this was a UFO.  I'm curious if this is actually belonging to military with borrowed alien technology.  I base this on the common sense fact that ET's would not necessarily need lights. I am a no-nonsense type of guy and the fact is, had I had my camera it likely would have produced the most clear and detailed photo of a UFO in history.  It was THAT distinct. I'm in my mid-50's.  This is the third UFO I've witnessed but not since the mid 1970's and never this close or with such clarity and detail.",2014-01-30T00:00:00,,

The sound was so loud as they approached from the SE (which would be from the Atlantic ocean side) that it seemed they would come right over my house by a few hundred feet...not thousands of feet, as they did.   I looked up to see three, black, triangular craft racing toward the NW at about 15,000 feet.  The three craft were about the size of my pinkie finger nail at arm's reach.  The amazing thing about these 3 craft, other than their deep, bass, loudness, was the fact that they were perfectly spaced from each other across..not forward to back.   The 3 were identical in shape and color..no after-burner or smoke of any kind...but perfectly spaced, both horizontally and vertically from each other, by, perhaps a mile or so.  Only the Navy's Blue Angels could come close to this juxtaposition, I believe.  The sound was the same as in past years as was the direction of travel..SE to NW.  Their first appearance, as I've reported previously, was very dramatic at rooftop level flight, and doing acrobatic maneuvers not consistent with conventional jets..their lighting was totally different as well.  Since that first encounter, about this time of year 3 or maybe 4 years ago, their appearances have been at much higher altitudes and their plane of travel has been perfectly straight and level.  I saw no lights from these craft today, but have in the past, at night, as one simple large blinking red light underneath each one.  My first sighting of these craft, as mentioned, involved multi lights on each craft, going from all white to all red and back to all white..very strange.

I was out walking the dog at approximately 6:50 PM on Feb 1, 2014.  It was crisp, clear, still night, and I often look up to see the moon and array of stars on such nights.   When I looked up, I saw what I first assumed were the red lights of 2 planes in the sky.  We live near where planes fly over going towards PDX, so this wouldn‘t be unusual.  What sparked my interest was their distance from each other.  They were very close for planes, so I continued watching them while walking the dog, looking up and down between the sidewalk (it was very dark in the area I was in), the dog, and the sky. In the brief moments of switching my gaze, another red “ball” appeared, as if a light was switched on, and again, very close to the two others already there, not moving.  Now, realizing these were not planes, I looked down, and gave the command to the dog to wait so we could stop and watch, and when I looked back up, another had arrived.  They were all lined in a horizontal row at this point.  A fifth red “ball” zoomed out of the East, joining the others, holding the horizontal pattern. 3 more, speeding to the others, for a total of 8 lined up.  Once the eighth one got there, they configured themselves, into what I have drawn below. They did not casually “float” into position, nor did they waver, they silently zoomed and stopped.  They held that configuration for about 20 seconds, then one by one, they disappeared; it looked liked they just blinked out.  As the configuration was disappearing, a ninth red ”ball” came from the East, lined up, held, as if waiting for the tenth, which then came zooming in as the last one held.  The 2 remained adjacent for a short time, and then just disappeared.   All of this happened very quickly, less than a few minutes. I thought a lot of people must have been watching this, so I’d just watch the news when I got home and probably find out what it was.

It was approximately 7:00PM.  There is a wooded area behind our house. I saw three circular red lights in the distance. They weren’t moving like planes, so I assumed that they were perhaps military helicopters.  I estimate that their altitude was perhaps 2,000 feet.  The other reason that I thought they were helicopters was that they seemed fairly close together, as opposed to how planes would be.  There was cloud cover and the lights were below the clouds. I didn’t think much of the lights until I noticed that they weren’t moving.  They were in a triangular formation with one light at the top, another light below it and to the left and a third light to the right of the second light and a bit below it.  I still thought that they must be helicopters at this point and I kept watching because it was unusual to see three of them flying together. At that point, the uppermost light moved in an unusual way.  From my viewpoint, it moved down and then to the left, toward the second light.  It remained there for just a couple of seconds and then went to the right and up to it’s original position as the top light in the triangle.  This movement was very fast and struck me as being unusual for a helicopter.  Both times that it moved, both going down and back up again, it followed what could be described as a reverse ‘L’ shape.  For example, it moved down and then moved to the left at a 90 degree angle.  After that, it followed the same path in reverse, moving quickly to the right and then moving up at 90 degrees to get to it’s original position. After seeing that movement, it finally occurred to me that they might not be helicopters. Other than The top light, the other two had not moved for over a minute.  I thought that it would be unusual for Three helicopters to maintain position for that long.  Also, there were no blinking navigation lights. Just solid red lights. I listened carefully for any noise of helicopters, but there was none.   Three helicopters that close and at that low altitude would have made noise. I grabbed my iPhone that was nearby and started taking what I intended to be a video, but as it turned out, there are just still photos.  I have three photos of the lights and also the trees in the foreground.  I went inside to get my girlfriend and have her look.  I was inside for perhaps 10 seconds.  When we both got out to the deck, only one of the lights remained. After a few seconds, it was no longer visible.  My thought was that it went above the cloud cover and could no longer be seen.

I was driving towards my high school with my father and my brother in the car.  We turned into the road, and I saw a motionless, jet-black circle (It didn't look spherical, it was a plain, black circle) in the sky just above the hills that surround my school.  It looked at first like a balloon, and did not pay much attention to it.   But as we were approaching the drive through, I thought again, and looked back at it.  I asked my brother if he saw it, but he was not paying much attention because it was early.  Neither did my father, because he was driving.  I then naturally thought to myself, ""Hey, could that be a UFO?"".   We pulled up to the driveway, and I left the car, heading in between the buildings of my school that blocked the hills; I wanted to go and take a better look at it.  My brother went to his locker. Looking between the buildings, I could still see it sitting motionless above the hill.  It may have been a trick of the eye, but I think I saw it! make small motions, moving a little up, then down left and right.  It still stayed in the general area, and it moved in these directions very slowly.  I called my friend that had just arrived to school over to take a look. I told him that there was a UFO.   He walked over not really believing me, until he got between the buildings.  His reaction: ""Oh, yea... What is that?""  He seemed pleasantly surprised.  I then pulled my other friend who had just arrived then to see it as well.   We began talking about it, wondering what it was, and debating on whether it was a balloon or something else.  I brought up the point that balloons are not complete spheres (plus it was a circle, not a sphere, it seriously looked two dimensional)  And if it was a balloon, then how did it not reflect ANY light whatsoever?  It was the blackest black I have ever seen in my life.   As we were talking, we noticed that it slowly started to descend behind the hill.  As it disappeared, I turned my head to my friend in excitement, but then he pointed and said, ""Whoa! !"". He told me that after I had turned my head, he saw a streak of black shoot up into the sky.",2013-12-23T00:00:00,33.52540409836065,-117.61945573770491

I was sitting in my car at the intersection of Vernonia Rd and Pittsburg Rd.  I was facing north on Vernonia, getting ready to turn left (west) onto Pittsburg.   I noticed the moon and glanced in its general direction and saw what appeared to be 3 lights emitting a faint glow moving from the SW to the NE.  The objects appeared to be at the same level as the lowest cloud layer, as initially I noticed the glow in the clouds.   I recall that the clouds were moving fast the same direction the objects were traveling.  Since the cloud layer was broken the three objects eventually moved out of the clouds and appeared to be perfect translucent orbs.  The best description I can come up with is they looked like bubbles with a thick membrane.   At this point they were almost directly overhead and did not seem to glow as much.   I then proceeded to turn onto Pittsburg Rd and drive maybe 20 yards and stop and looked out my drives window when I noticed another one.  At this point I looked out! my passenger window (the direction they were traveling) and saw maybe 8 or 9 glowing orbs in the distance approaching the horizon.  They were not in a formation from what I could tell, they were in a loose group and heading in the same direction, the few that I had initially seen were trailing behind slightly... At first I considered that they may be balloons, that were glowing from the moonlight.  However I doubt that the glow they would emit would be enough to cause a glowing aura around them in the clouds.  Also the 8 or 9 objects I saw towards the end of the sighting were a good distance off and were very visible (the glow was strong enough it looked like a solid light.)  I would also expect a balloon to tumble and possibly deviate slightly from its course with the others, none of these objects appeared to tumble nor did they deviate course at all.  The sighting maybe lasted a minute or so. I felt I should share this report in case their are others reports.  There was another car heading east on Pittsburg and was going slow, I did not notice if the driver was looking up at they sky, she might have been turning onto Vernonia Rd.

I was sitting on the couch watching TV at my friend’s apartment when I saw some very strange red glowing lights going past the window.  The apartment is on the second floor with no other buildings obstructing the view from this window, so the object was possibly 1/2 mile to 1 mile away and quite high in the sky. I saw one light, then two, then a third in a triangle formation that was spread out length-wise.  I first thought it was a blimp, but that made no sense as there were no games going on that night in LA that I was aware of. I went to the window and the lights started to spread out more.  One went higher, the other went further away and the third one kept drifting ahead on its original course.  The one that rose higher came more toward us.  We turned off the TV and heard no helicopter rotors.  There were no spotlights either, which would be expected if they were choppers flying in formation like that.  There were no blinking lights... not police lights or anything news choppers would have had.  They were just glowing red dots in the sky that were moving slowly along. Two of them flew out of sight because trees closer to us obscured them.  But the third one just seemed to be there for a moment, then we looked away for a second to get a phone to try filming them and when we looked again, the 3rd object had vanished, even though it had been moving very slowly and was in the open sky with no trees to slip behind anywhere near it. Very strange indeed.  Neither of us had any logical explanation for what we’d seen.  We kept watch for a few minutes longer, but the objects never returned. No reports of this in the Los Angeles news today or on the internet anywhere.  Would love to know if anyone else saw this.",2014-01-10T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

The entire event lasted about 20-25 seconds.   The lights came from the north-east sky and travelled of in a western direction.

I looked up toward the large window over the living room windows and saw what appeared to be a fire ball.   I got up and went to the windows.  It was traveling South to North, heading towards my location at a steady speed.  It was not windy out. 	It was a glowing red circle or orb, it did not emit smoke, it did not leave a tail.  I just stood watching it come closer and closer and was mesmerized by what it was so much so that I didn’t want to stop watching it to get my cell to take a video.  It made no sound.   It was approx. one story above the one story houses.  At it’s closest point to me, approx. 30 feet from me, it appeared to be between the size of a basket ball to a 3 foot circle which means it would have been larger in person.   It went between my house and the neighbors house at a steady speed.  I ran to the North side of the house and watched it continue North, it had already appeared on the North side of the houses and was traveling faster than I ran.   I did not feel threatened by this object at this point in time.  It appeared to be a red swirling ball of glowing gaseous liquid, but it was traveling at a constant speed and at a constant distance above the earth.  It appeared to be searching for something, ! or perhaps observing stuff.  I watched it disappear out of sight. 	I was hoping to see others, so I grabbed my phone, used the bathroom, and turned off the house alarm so I could go outside if I saw another one.  I went back and forth from the North to the South sides of the house looking out the windows to see if there were others.  Then at about 11:03 pm, I saw what appeared to be the same red glowing orb traveling from the North back South along the same exact path.  I activated my cell phone video but it’s shaky and the object appeared so small on the video compared to what I saw with my eyes.  All of a sudden I got an eery feeling because it seemed to be coming right at me and slowing down.  I decided to go outside to see it I could get a better video of it.  At this point, I am concerned as to not only what it is, buy why is it heading back toward me? As I walk outside and hold my cell up the object started traveling North away from me again.  At this point I am spooked.  I didn’t want to go outside, but feeling no threat and hearing! no sound from the object I thought I could just get a video of it as it went over me.  However, as I hold up my cell phone, the object starts rapidly traveling North again. 	I feel that it saw me and didn’t want to be taped.  The second video does not even show the object, despite my eyes seeing it.  During this time, there were no small planes in the area, but after watching it disappear out of sight the second time, I saw a small plane in the distance by the Vero Beach Airport.  I saw planes over the house earlier in the evening, they never fly that low, and I can always hear them. 	I have 2 videos and have taken still pictures from the first video.  When enlarging the still pictures, one of them looks like a face, and one of them looks like a swirly thing that could propel something if it weren’t in a gaseous bubble?

Here is what I saw: With the binoculars I could see 3 more.  At first I wondered if they were some kind of a very large bird, but they seemed to be so high up that it didn’t seem logical.  They were extremely white and bright with straight wings, but the ends were flat with slightly rounded corners.   Then, I wondered if it could be a piper cub plane, but it was so very high up, that did not make sense either.  They simply cruised, sometimes curving back like a bird of prey might do, and then other times they turned direction and came back in a straight line.   My total viewing time with the binoculars was approximately 20 minutes.  I also wondered if it was a fleet of drones. I must stress that the most important aspects of this sighting are that they were extremely white, that they were extremely high up, and that the wings were not bird like at the tips, but straight out, flat at the ends, with slightly rounded tips.

We all went out our back door of the house and I pointed to the area of the lights.  They all saw the same thing I saw, but it looked as if the lights began traveling northbound slowly.  One of the 5 lights looked as if it merger into one of the other lights. There were no sounds coming from the lights or anywhere else-other than the sound of neighbors talking (the sound travels in my backyard at night). At one point, I saw what looked like flashing lights of a small aircraft (green and red flashing light) was traveling from the east to west in a path going toward the lights.  As the flashing lights reached the far right side of the lights, the flashing lights disappeared.  The flashing red & green aircraft lights didn't change direction, didn't turn- they just disappeared. My wife ran back into the house to grab a camera to see if it would show up in a picture, so she thought to quickly grab her iPad mini.  She took several pictures, of which a couple clearly showed the lights of the object. After about 4-5 minutes, the lights appeared to continue traveling in a northern direction, then disappeared.

Two.  Saw them at 5:20 a.m.  From my vantage point in WLA, one was holding a fixed position roughly high above direction of Inglewood.  The second object was more NW, toward WLA.   Both were equally bright, appearing to be a row of lights with at least one below. Lights were white, with smaller green and amber lights..  Second one began moving west slowly, passed overhead without noise, then out of view.  First held its position from the time it was first visible, then gradually diminished in intensity, and then disappeared around 5:40 AM.  Lights went off.   I’m sure they will turn out to be nothing...just some crows with flashlights, pulling a fast one, perhaps.  Did not appear to be LAPD or media helicopters.

Two very very bright objects.  Hard to tell for sure, but it looked like three, maybe four very bright white lights in a row, with one or two underneath.  A half-cross.  Hints of red/amber from time to time.  It also appeared that the lights occasionally seemed to move slowly into different positions before going back to original formation.   One object remained stationary the whole time, roughly over Inglewood, very high (one would think, interfering with LAX flight path), and the other moved northwest slowly.  I figured it was a helicopter, but when it passed overhead (very high), there was zero noise.  ((woman'd name deleted)) is the last person to believe in this stuff, but she’s the one who spotted them and woke me up.   Black helicopters with soundless blades?  That’s the only remotely possible “logical” explanation I can come up with.  But the stationary one eventually diminished in intensity, then just went suddenly and entirely out.  What helicopter roughly in the flight path of LAX turns out its lights in total darkness? ((END ADDENDUM))",2014-04-18T00:00:00,34.0464,-118.4481

I went outside and while facing north, I could see three orange orbs going in a straight line across the sky slowly from West to East.

One of the orange orbs was out ahead of the other two I would say about double the distance that the second two were apart from each other.  We talked on the phone for a minute or two as the objects disappeared into the eastern sky.  About a minute after that, two more orbs appeared following the same path, and my sister and her husband arrived at my house as I pointed out the new orbs.

My girlfriend, and I were driving home from a night out in Lincoln, NH. We were on our way back to our home in Whitefield, NH, and had driven up Route 93 north through the Franconia Notch and then exited off Exit 36 towards Twin Mountain/Whitefield NH.  We drove along Route 3 towards Whitefield (approx 16 miles) without anything abnormal. After entering Whitefield on Route 3 we had crossed into the town by passing the town sign between Twin and Whitefield and proceeded up the hill towards Colby Rd.   As we crested the hill and started to turn right onto Colby Road I pointed out three good size orange spheres that appeared to be moving fairly slow on the driver’s side.  I asked her what she thought they were?  She didn’t know but I said “could they be helicopters on a night mission?  She was not sure but I rolled down my driver’s side window, slowed and came to a stop at the top of the hill entrance for Colby Road and tried to listen.  I did not hear any sound that sounded like a helicopter and only heard the wind. There were no other cars on the road and it was dark but you could see stars. I slowed down so I could try to watch them as I started down the hill on Colby.  For the 1-2 min period I sat there in my vehicle, they appeared to be moving but fairly slow and seem close enough to not be aircraft. If I had to guess I would say they were at least 1000-2000 feet up and above the farm fields near the hill. It is possible others saw this in the area but I do not know. I told her “lets speed down the hill” to see if I can get in the open and get a better view. We drove down while watching to the drivers side and I thought I caught a quick glimpse through the trees but was not sure. I eventually approached near Rexford’s construction which was more open with almost no trees and looked and slowed down but saw nothing. That is all. Hopefully someone else reports this.

They were all flying in approx a diagonal line at roughly the same altitude.  They all appeared to move together in unison so in this sense I believed they were in some sort of formation.  The sphere's had a strong orange glow with yellowish at the middle area and there appeared to be an orange aura around them also.  I could not make out any distinct shapes on the sphere.  There was no sound from them as far as I could tell. ((END ADDENDUM))",2014-01-30T00:00:00,,

I was on friends large property in El Cajon when I saw a friend of mine in the back yard staring up into a clear blue cloudless sky.  I asked ""Yo, Don what are you trippin on?""  He replied that he was watching a plane pass up in the sky when he noticed a fixed object (not moving) in the background of passing plane.   I at first thought ok your full of crap but I will look.  As my eyes stared and adjusted to the daylight it took a moment aprox. 2-3min before sure enough plain as day with the naked eye I could see what to me looked like maybe a high altitude weather ballon or possibly a planet being able to be viewed during the day if that where possible.  For at least 5 min I stared at the said object with my friend.  He asked if I had binoculars handy and I did.  I then walked to my trailer and was able to zoom into the object for a better look, what I saw I can only say I dont know what it was but what I thought would be a white object was actually one very bright light then turning to two.  It in my estimate was higher than any commercial airliner and seemed to not move except at one point it seeemed to drop closer to us.  What was even more bizarre was that higher above the said object there to me appeared to be a circular shadow.  We viewed the primary object plain as day for aprox 15-20 min.   When the experience was near over my friend was looking through the binoculars and I with the naked eye.  To me in a fraction of a second it vanished.  Now although the circular shadow was not visible to the naked eye I did see it faintly before the light was gone.  Like I said, to me looked it had the appearance of a far distant planet.   I did not think at all what I saw was light coming from something.  As I viewed the one light became two lights.  Looking through binoculars my friend saw the said object split into three and vanished I can say I for one did not see that.   It was  Jan. 20th 2014 at 4:43pm.  El Cajon, California ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport,  Sorry it has taken me a bit to get back to you, consequently I have been a bit busy lately. As for your question I can say in great confidence that over 17 years as a sport boat captain I know good and bad quality when it comes to binoculars I had a pair of expensive Minolta binoculars I used that day with a special rubber end cover that blocks out even the smallest amount of light that may enter through the sides when viewing. The reason I know the light changed from one to two then three was to me it looked to be pivoting or slowly spinning around in it's stationary spot. So what my grasp of it is that whatever it was it was rotating in a way that aloud me to see it like a car rounding a turn and you see the first headlight and as it completes the turn the second headlight comes into your view. I hope this analogy helps you a bit.  Like I mentioned before I have seen a lot of stuff in my time yet I can't for the life of me explain exactly what it was. I do appreciate you listening since nobody else does. I am an upstanding citizen with a perfect driving record I have never been known to be a fabricator of crazy stories I look at everything with an unbiased mind my reputation with friends is my honesty and trust I have built with many.  I look forward to any questions or insight you may have for me.  Thank you again and have a great day. ((END ADDENDUM))",2014-01-24T00:00:00,32.80505052631579,-116.91756842105264

I was walking home from the store, when I saw this seemingly endless parade of glowing lights.  They were orange-ish.  They had no blinking lights like planes, they were moving very slowly rising up from above the visible horizon, which was partly blocked by houses and trees so I only saw them when they rose above those.  They seemed to prefer flying in triangular formations, or something approximating a triangle.  They would fly a certain distance across the sky and then gradually fade out.  I am unaware of any normal explanation for these things: apart from their bizarre appearance, there were too many of them too quickly to be civilian, and there was no official military activity to explain them either.  They moved slowly but at times seemed to zig zag in a narrow area in a way that seemed unlike airplanes, but I can't prove that.  I caught video of it on my smartphone, and when that failed to take video due to low battery (my Moto G refused to shoot video when the battery got too low), I switched to my tablet (Nexus 7 2013 edition rear-facing camera).  At some point one of my neighbors came out and was seeing it, but her English was imperfect so we had a hard time understanding each other.  I was on the phone with my fiancee at the time, so you can often hear my side of the conversation but not hers. I hesitated to even report this, but this was way too big.

Way too fast to be a plane and had absolutely no sound.  Complete silence.  It was flying as low or lower than a plane coming into the air port for landing, but going in the opposite direction, toward  the West.  It did go in a straight line, not changing directions.

On December 17th at approximately 5:45 PM, I was in my vehicle heading due west on Park Blvd approximately 1/4 of a mile east of the Park Blvd/Seminole Blvd intersection.  Straight ahead in my field of vision, in the distance of what I instinctively perceived to be towards the end of Park Blvd (where it runs into the beach or the Gulf of Mexico) I saw in the sky six to eight ""glowing"" objects.  I am positive there were six, I thought there could have been another two lower in the sky and in the far right of my field of vision.  The objects appeared to be small balls of light with what appeared to me to be connected to short vapor trails.  If there had been only a single object I would have associated this with a typical small aircraft, but because of the number of objects and their proximity to each other I could not imagine that these objects were aircraft.  Because of the direction of the ""vapor trails"" it was quite obvious that the objects were moving in either a straight downward direction (perpendicular to the horizon) or downward at a diagonal direction towards the horizon.  While there was no quick movement it did appear that the lenght of the ""vapor trails"" was slowly growing.  These objects appeared to be white, or a ""white light"".   Against the setting orange colored sky these objects appeared very bright, or would be very bright at a closer range.  The sky was very clear as a cold front had wiped away most, if not all of the cloud cover.  The objects appeared larger than stars and a little smaller than the size of Venus in the evening southwest sky. 	In the end, the best comparison I can make is that these objects very closely resembled those in science fiction movies when meteorites have entered Earth's atmosphere and are hurling towards the planets.  My gut reaction when I saw the objects was exactly that of ""Oh no there are meteorites heading towards us"".  Then I realized that was a little improbable as someone somewhere would have detected an event of that nature in advance. 	I was not able to investigate further and had to turn away from the objects and head towards home.  They were still glowing when I left.  I am forwarding a short video separately from this report.  One final note, as I turned down my street I noticed that a Coast Guard helicopter which usually flies swiftly in a southerly direction down the coast was taking additional time covering the area, possibly circling.",2013-12-23T00:00:00,27.84632195121951,-82.7880024390244

On 12/17/13 I was on my way home from work approximately 8:40 p.m. Across from the veterans Hospital in Bay Pines Florida I witnessed a large Pear shaped fireball.  Its altitude was approximately 1,000ft high and due west.  I pulled over to the gas station mounted my phone in a still mount and began capturing video in HD.  During which time I noticed other smaller objects coming up and joining or twirling around said fireball.  To the naked eye you could see only a asprin sized amber colored ball and tiny spots of light coming from the ground to the object.  After reviewing frame by frame I noticed a common feature I have seen in other videos other residents and I have captured.  The Object is actually a circle of  smoke or a shock wave when zoomed in on with a Galaxy Note 3 HD video camera.  I have seen black shadow figures on the beach twice and orbs coming out of the gulf nightly since October 27th.  I mention this only because while reviewing frame by frame I c! aptured several black entities that have an electric bolt connection from the object in the air to a building below and to the south.  These black entities are on what appears to be a porch structure of the building and appear to be ascending and descending from the object. I called the hotline and spoke with a gentleman who told me that there was no way I have seen 50 UFOs since October 27th!

At about 10:30 p.m. on the night of March 30, 2014, me and one other individual were outside letting the dog go potty.  In mid-conversation, the person whom I was with pointed up exclaiming at me to look, whereupon I found myself looking at what I first thought were TWO low-flying objects, both boomerang or triangular shaped, moving in perfect proportion with each other.   The first set of lights being about a dozen in quantity and the second set of lights being only three, flying at a brisk and constant pace through the night sky.   The other I was with described it as a very “smooth moving” object, to which I agree.  In addition, there was no sound of any kind to go with the moving lights, they moved in utter silence. The lights flew off and out of sight within a maximum of 15 seconds. After the object left sight, me and the other I was with were in sheer bewilderment and attempted to justify what we saw.  As if on cue, a human-operated commercial airplane was flying elsewhere in the sky.  The point I would like to make is that this plane looked entirely different than what we saw, and it appeared to be at a much higher altitude as well. 	We both went back inside discussing and drawing what we saw before Google’ing what we just saw.  We then saw multiple reports from other people describing exactly what we saw as far as the shape, speed, and sound of the object.  This is where I decided based on mutual images of the UFO’s that it was most likely ONE flying object with three under lights.  This would explain how the sets of lights were moving in such closeness and perfection with each other.   We also discovered that the night March 30th, has been a significant date in the history of UFO sightings with waves of UFO sightings having occurred in Belgium, U.K., the U.S. and more. 	I would also like to add that me and the individual I was with are credible sources, we wrote this report on the exact night (within a half hour) of the sighting, and we had no alcohol or any other substances that could have altered what we saw whatsoever, and we totally agreed with one another about exactly what we had just seen.

The sky was partly cloudy with good sunshine. At first I thought it was a balloon because it was moving so slowly; but then I realized that it was drifting AGAINST the prevailing west wind.  I pointed it out to my wife, who agreed it looked like a dark-colored balloon.  She went into the house and brought my binoculars for a better look. Through the binoculars, I saw a distinctly black, triangular object — it looked rather like a bat-kite, which seemed reasonable to me on a gusty day like today, and it would explain the thing moving AGAINST the west wind. Once I tentatively identified the object as a high-flying kite, I estimated the “kite” was maybe 6 feet wide and 400 feet in altitude, which would not be out of the question for some kite enthusiasts. However, I then noticed a dark tether hanging straight down from the black triangle attached to something like an angular, light brown box that didn’t look aerodynamic at all.  The box-like object was about one-quarter the size of the black triangle.  This made me question my kite theory. Then, as I was watching it, the whole assembly disappeared into the clouds — I actually watched it go into one of the cumulous clouds that were moving west to east. That blew me away, because it meant the craft could NOT be a mere 6 feet wide and 400 feet high...it must have been more like 5000 FEET altitude, or more, in order for it to disappear into a cloud.  Which means it had to be a LOT bigger than a kite. If the thing was actually 5,000 feet in altitude, that’s about 13 times HIGHER than I had estimated, which would mean my estimation of its physical dimensions was way off, also.  It had to be much larger than I estimated. The craft did not reappear from the clouds. The entire sighting lasted about 2 minutes and only crossed, perhaps, 25 degrees of the sky, very slowly, from east to west.  We were looking due south, probably 45 or 50 degrees above the horizon.",2014-04-04T00:00:00,35.2558,-81.3707

Natural Light Phenomenon or UFO?  Okay . . . Here’s how it went.  On the afternoon of Thursday, March 6, 2014, at 3:45 p.m., here in Bartonsville, Pennsylvania, I was on the rear enclosed sun porch making some close-up JPG pictures of old silver dollar coins.  It’s good and bright out there in the afternoon so natural light is all that’s needed.  The now antiquated Nikon D1H digital SLR somehow seems to make sharper close on pictures than the later model D2HS camera with much improved light sensor computer system. While working there making close-up photos with the D1H, I happened to glance out the window to the southwest and noticed in the mostly blue skies, numerous plane contrails.  It was first pondered as to what might be going on to get so much weekday afternoon apparent military jet activity.  Looking up again towards our now broken whirlee-gig windmill that's atop the rear deck upper railing, a blotch of rainbow colored light was seen shining from behind an odd wispy rippled cloud.  That was about 3:48 p.m. with the afternoon sun getting lower over in the west.  It seemed then as if the sun was maybe shinning into the cloud at a precise angle and reflecting ice crystals making the rainbow colors.  I took the old D1 camera and strolled out onto an ice free area of the back deck to make a couple of pictures. About the same time, the light from within the cloud became very bright as if something shiny was up there reflecting the sunlight. Noticed then was a trail of what appeared to be exhaust smoke or maybe vapor in the form of small puffy clouds.  It was then realized that what was being seen was NOT a rainbow but something else.  After clicking a couple of more pictures it was noticed that the battery on the D1 camera was getting low. I returned inside the house and grabbed the Nikon D2HS camera with fully charged battery and big memory card with 2.1K remaining picture slots.  By the time I got back outside the bright light in the sky had faded along with most of that unusual wispy mackerel skin cloud having disappeared.  It was realized then that the mask like cloud was somehow related to the hovering anomaly.  By that time there were more puffy little clouds in a row leading to a stationary light rust colored blob at the same spot in the sky.  I took some more pictures of the unusual cloud effects and returned inside. Once back in, I happened to glance outside to see the reddish blob again transforming into a brilliant light being more defined with a sort of shape with what looked to be a pair of blazing headlights. The skies all around were also again filled with crisp fresh jet contrails. Noticed too was that the light from the object was shining or reflecting as beams into surrounding clouds. The wispy rippled cloud around the object seemed to also expand and get rapidly bigger. A series of pictures was made within probably seven or eight minutes. Though I was tempted to put the camera on the 8-frames per second motor drive, it was decided to make more carefully composed individual pictures. Wanted the foreground images to help show perspective and location. In total, there are probably 20 or 25 pictures made with two professional grade, though older model, digital cameras. Of those, some look to be washed out before a lens hood was installed. The images on the original memory cards ha! ve not been modified so that the sequence of photos can be verified if needed.  Below are four pictures made Thursday, March 6th, 2014 of the above described. These are in sequence with time between.  Photos:  ~ First view shows the rust red color blob with puffy clouds (vapor or exhaust?) trailing behind. Second picture is of a glowing object that developed within the wispy rippled skin cloud. The other two photos speak for themselves.   ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))",2014-03-18T00:00:00,41.0175,-75.2869

We looked at it together for a few minutes and then went back to bed (both in my bed this time because he was scared).

First let me say I consider myself to be an amateur Ufologist. I have done quite a bit of research, reading witness reports from a variety of people (ie: military personnel, government officials, citizens, etc.) and have watched many documentaries as well as UFO craft caught on tape. At around 5:50 PM on dec 31, 2013, I was drivng westward home from work and just got onto highway 212, and while I approached the ""eden prairie road"" exit near chanhassen I at first noticed only one light in the sky to my right, roughly 200-300 feet in the air.  Because of my UFO interest, I daily see objects in the sky and try to figure out what they are out of curiosity, always keeping an eye out for something which is possibly an ET craft.  I am very skeptical, usually concluding most objects are planes, helicopters, or some other known craft.  But this first object appeared as a single light to my right, staying in the same position in the sky, but as I got closer and approached it I noticed three white lights in a triangular pattern underneath. At first I was shocked, thinking ""its probably just a helicopter."" Once I got even closer I saw another object with the same set of lights to my left, both appeared to be hovering close to the highway not moving, the one to the left of my was almost directly over the high way. I was travelling at about 50 MPH so I approached them relatively quickly. As I approached  even closer, within about 400 feet I saw both of them had a blinking red light in the middle of the three lights. They were within 500 feet of one another at about the same altitude. I started approaching both of them, but because the object to the right was not as directly over the high way I could not see as clear under it, but I did see same lights on both of them. I passed the first object to the ! right, it stayed in the same spot. I came closer to the second object to my left and once I was nearly directly under it I saw the ""shape"" of the lights more clear. Three white, stable lights in a triangular pattern with a red light in the middle, all of them were ""symmetrical"" and evenly distributed within a very close proximity of one another. In my estimate these objects were maybe 20 or 30 feet in diameter overall. The red light was more of a pulsating light, not a quick blink, but rather a more soft pulsation. The lights all looked like the same size. I could not see any ""outline"" of the objects as it was dark outside, there were absolutely no other lights as far as I could see. I was careful as I could be driving but kept my eye on these objects and got a very good look at the second one to my left. It did not move, no rotating, no altitude change. I kept driving and as I got away it stayed there. As I got off on powers blvd exit and took! a right heading north, I looked to my right and saw three bri! ght whit e balls of light travelling at a fast speed, moving up and down casually performing very odd and almost unearthly maneuvers. I put my eye on the road, passed a few trees to the right which blocked my view, and looked again and the objects had vanished. I have seen videos of supposed ET craft ""ascending"" out of earths atmosphere in clusters, and even ""taking off"" and incredibly highspeeds, essentially vanishing, and the way these three craft were elegantly travelling was identical to this.  I was not hallucinating, there were hundreds of cars travelling on this road as it was rush hour. I am certain there are others who saw these objects and possibly took photo/video, as I did not. If anyone who reads this report and saw the same thing I urge you to make your own report so others know they are not alone.",2014-01-10T00:00:00,44.858,-93.5588

The object appeared to hover behind the Capitol Building before falling rapidly then disappearing.  What struck as as odd to cancel out what it could be are; though a plane or helicopter has the same colored lights, these lights seemed to alternate and if it were a plane then the a single light stretched across the entirety of both wings, aside from Medical helicopters from the hospital on the other side of town the capitol is a no fly zone this didnt take the shape of a helicopter,   There was no noise from the craft, which lifestar (local medical helicopter name) makes quite the noise when in the city area, we also canceled out the chanc! e of it being part of the fire works display, being it was before they went off, and was in the wrong direction. Then shortly after the fireworks display started, and lucky enough to have my camera out with recording capabilities, the obeject was seen again this time on the other side of the captiol.  unfortunately in video mode my camera has no zoom ability nor night vision, and appears as like that of a star in the sky.  Though the object can be seen between the space of the capitol and where the fireworks were going off.  Additionally towards the end of the encounter the object started a rapid descent, then a dead stop then it did it again and vanished, what strikes me odd is where the object vanished is a point of open sky, nothing between me and the object for it to hide behind, with a few flashes it was gone.  The other object flashing below and to the right of it is a warning strobe on a flag pole, of the no fly zone.

My wife, three friends and I were leaving the Crow’s Nest restaurant adjacent the harbor in Santa Cruz, CA after having New Year’s Eve dinner.  We’d started about 5:00 and enjoyed a good meal and conversation.  None of us had had anything to drink, and we wanted to get home relatively early.  We’re not big revelers…  While we walked through the parking lot to our cars, I looked to the southwest, out over Monterey Bay, and noticed a reddish-orange, round ball of light in the sky.  I initially took it to be aircraft headlights, as there is a flight path that crosses the bay heading to SFO and planes’ lights can often be seen.  I reconsidered almost immediately though and mentioned it to my wife and friends, joking that there was a UFO in the sky.  They all looked and saw it as well. What made me reconsider my observation was, first, its color.  Plane headlights are white.  This was definitely a reddish orange.  Secondly, there was no apparent movement.  Planes usually have at least some offset of their flight path relative to the viewer that causes some appearance of lateral movement.  This had none.  It stood still in the air.  Third, it appeared wider than the aircraft lights one normally sees in the sky at night.  I’d guess that it looked nearly as wide as a pencil eraser held at arm’s length.  It was about 30 degrees about the horizon. The object stayed fixed in place for several minutes while we chatted and readied to leave.  This enhanced its oddness to us, so we were all watching it when, in the course of a few seconds, it grew brighter and larger, then disappeared.  I thought I recalled it moving slightly to the right as it brightened, but my wife doesn’t remember that. After it disappeared, I suggested that it must have been a Chinese lantern.  I’ve heard of such being floated in the night sky before, and being mistaken for UFO’s, but I’ve never knowingly seen one.  It seemed plausible at the time though. I’d of left it at that but for catching you on C2C yesterday (1/1/14) describing multiple reports of what sounds remarkably like what we witnessed.  We were startled to hear you talk of many reddish orange balls of light being reported in the last day, because this is exactly what we saw.

As he and our daughter stepped outside a second fireball appeared at the tree line in almost the same location as the original.  This fireball also began to gain altitude but veered slightly to the north then back south in an almost zigzag like pattern.  At this time the original fireball was very high in the sky and travelling in a southern direction and then faded to the point we could no longer see it with our eyes.  Just before the original fireball faded a third fireball was visible from the tree line  where the first two had originated.  Also travelling in a similar pattern to the first two fireballs.

It was unnaturally quiet.   After watching the third fireball fade into the night sky, we went back inside.  We were inside for about 2 minutes and I opened the front door and stepped back outside to see if it would occur again and behold there was a fourth fireball just clearing the tree line in the west but instead of going up it moved east in the direction of where we were. And slowly it began to veer to the south and gain altitude, but it seemed to move much slower than the first three. As it turned it did not appear to be a fireball anymore.

I'm a 38 year old stay at home mom.  College education. Worked in commercial real estate before staying at home with the children.  I'm an avid sky watcher.  It's not something I invest a lot of time in, but I'm always looking.  I'm fascinated with the general beauty of stars and night sky.   Went to the National Observatory south of Tucson and learned how to look at stars and find cool things like tracking a satellite.  It is of note that I live close to Cecil Wright Airfield and NAS JAX.  So I see all types of aircraft daily.  So when I had a errand to run before New Years, I took notice of the sky.  There were minor fireworks.  And stars in the sky.  But I noticed a red ball of light traveling at a steady speed.   As I'm not a pilot, I cannot judge the height or speed of this object.  But it appeared to float in the night sky.  At a steady speed.  Not high enough to be an airliner.  But maybe the height of an helicopter, but with no sound.  I was transfixed by this object, ! trying to put it as some sort of military object.   Then another floated behind it. The path looked like a northeast to southwest.  But again, I'm only guessing.  This was followed by 2 more for a total of 4.  It lasted about 7 minutes from what I witnessed. And I was able to get pictures with my iPhone 5s.  But the ball of light appears white/yellow in pictures, but was a very bright red with my naked eye.  The objects disappeared from sight within that 7 minute window.  And I've never seen anything like it.  Maybe it's a military exercise or something?  Very weird",2014-01-10T00:00:00,30.082955102040817,-81.86297346938775

I would have been 15 years old, and was shooting baskets in my driveway when I looked up and saw a metallic-looking sphere float silently over my head. I was an “A” student and was somewhat of an astronomy and airplane enthusiast. I’ve sent an accompanying map with an inset showing what the sphere looked like to ufocntr@nwlink.com.  I found a photo of a doll on the Internet (called “Baby Catch-a-Ball”) that my then 13-year-old sister owned, which I remember looked almost identical to the object.  The object was a dull metallic grey and looked perfectly spherical.  It did not reflect or “glint” in the sunlight. The object appeared to be about 9 inches in diameter (i.e., larger than the toy ball).  It followed a perfectly straight line, maintained constant elevation, and made no sound.  I would estimate it was traveling at around 5-10 mph, and therefore I was able to follow it easily for a couple of minutes. On the map, I show the path of the object.  It was probably at an altitude of 50 feet AGL and passed almost directly over my head.  What was odd about it was that it traced an absolutely linear path – so I ruled out a balloon or something that could be influenced by air currents.  I don’t remember there being any wind that day, so its constant speed and altitude were a bit alarming. It was also odd in that it did not make any sound whatsoever and was able to maintain its constant heading and altitude at such a low speed.  I was able to follow it until its silhouette disappeared as it passed the other side of a house (about four doors down and around a corner). When it was almost directly overhead, I remember being tempted to pick up a small rock and throw it at the object, but then I decided against it for fear I would incite some sort of harmful response.  I also remember not calling out to my mother, who was inside the house, for fear of scaring her.  So I never told her or anyone else about it.",2014-03-27T00:00:00,,

The following occurred in Newport Beach, California, on a Saturday night/Sunday morning at approximately 2 AM on October 26, 1996:   I was out for a jog, and I was running southward down the beach at  approximately 2 AM between 68th and 56th Streets.  Out of the corner of my left eye I saw several green fireballs falling, which I turned to look at.  They were falling on the north side of Pacific Coast Highway (approximately near what I later learned had been a military airstrip in Costa Mesa that had been used  back in the forties).   The green fireballs were only falling approximately 30 to 50 feet in the air.  I thought it was odd, but I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to it, because I was thinking that they could be fireworks or something, and so I kept running.   Because I had just seen the green fireballs, my eyes were alert and able to move quickly to what I saw next, which occurred approximately 30 seconds after I saw the green fireballs.  Out of my upper left peripheral vision, I saw a streak come nearly straight downward like a shooting star, which left a trail in the atmosphere, like the tail of a comet.  At the same instant, I heard it make a slight ""pfft"" sound.   The trail wasn't straight above me, but it was above me, forward, and to my left.  I looked at this trail in the atmosphere in wonderment, and as I was looking, I saw that at the bottom of the trail (where the the head of the comet would be), there was an object, which wasn't going anywhere, but was shaking.  It seemed unstable, and then it started gliding erratically forward and downwards left and right, looking shaky, with motions that looked very much like the motions of a butterfly.  It then stabilized into a smoother glide.   I noticed the object had an orange glow, which I realized must've been caused by friction from the atmosphere, because it obviously entered the atmosphere from outer space at a very high rate of speed, maybe 20,000 to 50,000 miles per hour, and then abruptly came to a dead stop approximately 700 to 1000 feet above me. (a mind blowing maneuver!)  During the time that the object was at the bottom of the ""comet-like tail,"" it was shaking in mid air, so it was hard to see what it's shape was.  It seemed like it could've been a hat shaped UFO, possibly black and silver colored, but as it started gliding it seemed as though it was a different shape.  It seemed like it was more of a Batplane shape or a glider wing; black, but with tinges of an orange glow.   This craft made no sound, though I do have a vague recollection that there may have been a faint sound which could be comparable to the sound of a sailboat's sails being blown by the wind, or the kind of sound that a hang glider might make while flying.  I would attribute the sound to atmospheric friction against the craft, which would mean I must've been fairly close to it in order to hear that, considering the sound of the surf was coming from 50 to 70 feet to the right of me. Estimating how high the craft was and its size is difficult because it was nighttime, and the thing seemed to be changing its shape.  If it was approximately 700 to 1000 feet above me, then I would estimate it to be maybe 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The next description of maneuvers  coincided with the objects gradual shape shifting some more, and becoming circular, or oval shaped, with a milky white color, almost as though there was a cloudy white film forming around the object. At a very high rate of speed, as it was becoming encapsulated in some kind of milky white plasma, it started doing big S shape maneuvers which defied any physics I'd ever experienced.  It whipped around to the right as though it was a tetherball attached to a pole, and then it whipped around to the left in the same way.  The size of these big S shape maneuvers would cover an area the size of 10 to 15 football fields.  It would intermittently stop, but not completely, and it was at these stopping points that its motion had a profound effect on me.  I could sense what its propulsion was based on.   The profound ""big picture""realization I had was that the object's strange movement, no longer seemed strange when viewed within the context of experiencing gravity and the inertia of myself and the Earth moving together through the cosmos.  To illustrate what I mean, picture yourself in a race car in a race at the Indy 500, and there's another race car in front of yo! u weaving and darting quickly left and right.  In context with you experiencing the speed of your vehicle and seeing the payment moving very very quickly underneath your race car, the motion of that race car in front of you would seem normal.  But the motion of the race car in front of you wouldn't seem normal if you and the race car that you were in were just sitting still while the payment underneath you was also completely still.  When experiencing the UFO object's motion with in the context of Newtonian physics, where in, the earth and I were seemingly standing still, the motions of the UFO looked odd.   But in the context of experiencing the inertia of myself and the Earth moving together through the cosmos, the UFO's motions didn't look odd.  This is more in the realm of quantum physics perhaps, because it's not just the relationship of the UFO's movements with myself in context with the Earths gravity that makes up the equation, but additionally, it's also the inertia of the earth and the inertia and gravitational properties of the s! olar sys tem, and the inertia of the galaxy etc.   The UFO caused me to feel myself traveling at the speed of the earth and even possibly sense the speed of the solar system through the galaxy.  Seeing this UFO helped me to understand that the UFO was using principles of celestial mechanics to propel itself.  Here's another illustration in the form of a riddle/question which I will sometimes ask people in order to get them to start to ponder and grasp the concepts that I was able to realize as a result of having this experience:   Question:  How does a UFO accelerate from 0 miles an hour to 50,000 miles an hour, all in a split second?  Answer:  It puts on the brakes. The S patterns gradually moved away from me Southward and then subsided and turned into a weaving flight like that of of an agile aircraft.  It headed southward toward Laguna Beach and morphed into what looked more like a projection then a physical object, like the projection of a spotlight on a cloud, or a film being projected onto a cloud.   I watched it as it gradually moved further and further away, moving in the direction of Laguna Beach, until it was finally out of site.",2014-03-27T00:00:00,33.62471950617284,-117.88516172839506

One evening in the spring or summer of 2005 my wife and I were in our family room, with the doors to our deck open (screens were closed), watching a TV show about NASA and deep space exploration.  I would guess it was on the discovery channel. When the show got to the part about the kind of special engine it would take to travel millions of miles, they showed an animation of a satellite and played the sound of the engine…  which sounded like a hot-air balloon, when it’s burning gas to heat the air inside it (a constant Cauuuuu sound). But what caught our attention, was when the show went to commercial, the sound continued???  So I went out onto our deck, we lived on the edge of a forest at the time, and looked up expecting to see a hot air balloon. But what I saw, was a spaceship, a big spaceship that seemed to be defying gravity.  It was a hundred or two feet in front of me, and few hundred feet above the ground, not going very fast.  Going left to right, perpendicular to our house and deck. FYI – In the direction I was looking there are no roads, no houses, or lights, just forest and marsh, for about a mile and a half, and no airports nearby. I immediately called my wife out to the deck, and we both watched it… up close and with clear view of it.  It was big enough to pretty much black out the sky. The dimension are a complete guess, but something like 100’ across, 200’ long and 40’ tall, with a glowing engine covering the entire backside of the craft. As far as the shape goes, and I hate to say this, it looked a lot like something out of a Star Wars or Star Trek movie, only a little more rugged.   It was close. Anyways, we stood there watching it move slowly with that constant Cauuuu sound… then when it got about a mile off to our right (our house was on a hill), the thing went into some kind of near instant warp speed, and arced away and up, and was gone in two or three seconds. The glow from its’ engine allowed us to track its’ amazing rapid accent. Once it had gone, we didn’t report the incident to the police, as we’re both professionals, and didn’t want any bad PR. But the next morning, when we told the story to our employees and made light of it, we got the expected ribbing…  but one of them told us they’d been a story that morning in the Lewiston Sun Journal, about a woman in Auburn (our sister city, on the other side of the river) who had called the police to report a UFO or strange lights. We never bothered to look for the story, as we were very busy, and didn’t subscribe to the paper. If anyone wants to pin-point the date, and time, they can look for the woman’s story in the Lewiston Sun Journal, and then check Time Warner’s TV show listings on that date. As a little background, neither my wife nor I do drugs, or alcohol.  Nor have seen a UFO before, or since. And have gone years without telling other people about this story. My guess is the spaceship had possible landed on a wide, isolated part of the Androscoggin River for water, and was in the process of taking off when it passed over us.  The river is about 3,500 feet to the west of us, with only a hand full of houses in between.",2014-03-27T00:00:00,44.1921,-70.1442

As I looked closer, it was three white lights in a triangular form that appeared to be fallowing me, but never moved out of formation.   Since I had recently moved to the area I told myself I was just imagining it out of fear because I was driving down a dark country road. Tonight (4/11/14) while driving home I seen the three bright lights again.  They hovered above the trees in the same formation as I had seen before.   I thought about all the possibilities of what it could be but nothing logical comes to mind.  There is not a home in that area and it there were the lights did not pulsate or the view of them did not get obstructed in any way as I traveled further down the road, lights from anything that would come from a home or even a person in the woods would have been blocked by the trees in this heavily wooded area.   As I said before these lights hovered directly above the trees (not way up in the sky) they also did not have a beam coming from them, more like 3 bright white orbs in a triangular formation that moves but does not break the formation.",2014-04-18T00:00:00,39.2018,-82.2047

At approximately 9:30 pm on April 11th, 2014, as I was walking out to my horse barn, I noticed 3 large, bright lights in the Southeast sky.  Their color was an orange-yellow. At first, the lights appeared to be in a stationary line (like they were side by side).   The lights appeared to be over the golf course at the end of property.  There is cell phone tower to the left of the citing, a crop field behind it, and a rural neighborhood development to the right of it. 	As I continued to stare at the lights, (2-3 minutes) they began to slowly move.  It became clear that the lights belonged to a single object that was rotating clockwise.  I judged the craft to be as big as my house (a 3,000 sq. ft. modified split-level) and as low in the sky as the tallest type of stadium lights.  As the craft moved, it rose higher in the sky and the lights began to intermittently, slowly dim and then brighten again, though they did not return to the same brilliance I had first seen when they were stationary in the row. 	After the object turned, I got the impression that the object was triangular in shape and that the lights had appeared in a row before only because the craft was facing me. 	After watching it for several more minutes, only one light remained lit and it began to move off to the north until it was too far away for me to see anymore.  As it moved off in the distance it appeared to be about the height of the mature treetops it passed behind, and it seemed to be about ¾ the height of the cell phone tower it passed.  Of course, it could have been much higher in the sky than those estimates, and my perception could have been influenced by a distance perspective. 	In total, approximately ten minutes passed from the time I first walked outside and noticed the lights to the time I watched the last lit light disappear.  I do not know what the object I observed was, I am certain that it was not an airplane or an astrological  ((sic.  astronomical?) phenomenon.

My experience happened on Friday evening on April 11th, at 9:29pm.   I was driving East on Highway 54, near the unincorporated town of Dexterville, Wisconsin, when my fiancé said, ""What is that in the sky?"" I looked up and saw two separate smooth dark black triangular shaped crafts with light blue hazy lights, I said ""those aren't airplanes.""  One was right behind the other at a close distance.   I slowed down the vehicle and looked at the clock; then looked back at the sky to notice these crafts were much larger than a jet (3 times the size of a jumbo jet).  They were in the sky as high as a radio tower.  By this time I had stopped my vehicle on the highway, and we were almost right under them.   My fiancé told me to shut off the radio, and that's when I heard a very faint constant ticking sound.   As these things moved slowly by us, and were a distance (I know this area well, and I gauged their distance by the road I had previously come off of) of 3 miles, when all at once I saw what I can only describe as a single firework emitting 8-10 strands of light coming down, and then it happened again 5 seconds later.   After this I only saw one craft for about 10 seconds and then I saw nothing.  I just couldn't believe what I saw. The whole experience lasted about 3 minutes.  These were no type of plane, or stealths, I've seen both these aircrafts and these things in the sky that I saw were just massive in size compared to those. As we continued to leave we saw a woman turn onto Highway 54 and stopped her and asked her if she saw what we saw, she explained that she had seen the light show and thought it was fireworks.   After reaching our destination (which was a casino) I began telling an employee what happened.  And I began to tell her about seeing something in the sky she stopped me and said, ""I saw the same thing, but only one craft"" (and it was one and a half hours after our experience). This is my report, I stand true to what I say, and if they're out there, we have the right to know.   After seeing this there is no doubt in my mind that something else is out there.

I told my son and my friend ""look it's a fighter plane"".  We watched it for about 8 seconds as it flied by directly above us.  Then a large gray object approached the fighter plane from the rear at a very fast speed.  The object had no navigation lights like the fighter jet had. It only had 4 very dim bar lights between the main body and the wings.  I thought it was going to crash into the fighter plane.  It slowed down suddenly about 3 plane lengths away behind the fighter plane. It followed the plane for about 5 seconds.  Then the object gained speed, made a hard right, and then a hard left, cutting off the fighter plane.   The object could be seen more clearly when it turned because it banked left. Then you could tell that the object was shaped like a stingray without a tail.  It was gray and about 12 times larger than the fighter plane. 4 dim bar lights on each side where the wings joined the main body.  The wings were not fixed.  The wings rippled at opposite rhythm like a stingray.  The object took off heading northwest very fast.

I am an avid night sky watcher (meteor showers, planet conjunctions, satellites spotting, comets, I.S.S. passings, etc.), so I am quite familiar with ""normal"" night sky sightings. On the night of January 20th 2014, I saw something I've never seen before.  As I was walking out the back door of my workplace to smoke a cigarette at 11:25pm EST, I first noticed the moon about 25 degrees off the horizon straight in front of me. It was the first clear night we've had in at least a week.  As I was looking at the moon a bright light traveling northeast caught my eye.  This light was traveling pretty much in the same location from my vantage point as the moon so it was easy to see.  My first initial thought was that this bright light was the I.S.S., so I ran to my truck 10 feet away and grabbed my binoculars to look at it.  I put my elbows up on my truck so I was steady and found this bright light through my binoculars.  What I saw as one solid bright white light with naked eye turned out to be a triangle shaped UFO, with 3 lights. I could not believe what I was seeing.  I watched it for 30-40 seconds as it traveled away from me. The details of this object: the front light of the triangle was a huge solid white light. It did not change color or blink.  The back 2 light were the same size but were flashing at random it seems from, white/red/blue.  The elevation was probably a little higher than normal helicopter traffic.  Although, since it was dark it was hard to tell. I saw this thing clear as can be through those lenses.

The incident I witnessed took place in Thousand Oaks, CA (SE Ventura County) at approximately 0600 – 0615 hours on Tuesday, January 21, 2014.  The weather was cool with a light breeze.  The sky was mostly overcast with some stars visible.  It was still dark.  The moon had set. My location was in a shopping center parking lot on Janss Road and N. Moorpark Road, located about 2 miles north of US-101 freeway and about ¾ of a mile west of the CA-23 freeway which runs north and south. At approximately 0600 hours, I happened to look up into the eastern sky and saw two lights, one blue and one red, very close together, not moving.  The lights appeared at first glance to be what I thought was a hovering helicopter, from 500-1000 feet off the ground.  The angle of the lights to me was about 60 degrees.  The two lights were bright, clear and distinct.  I would describe them like an LED.  There was only a tiny separation between the two, but it was distinct.  They were separate, but very close together.  I would describe the size of the objects about the size of the planet Venus or maybe a tiny bit smaller.  I could not see any type of aircraft or fuselage or body that they were attached to because of the darkness of the sky.  If I held my thumb up to the sky to cover the object, it would cover the lights. Because I was at work at the time, doing security for a construction crew,  I had to get about my business and giving the stationary lights one last glance, I resumed doing my job. About 5 minutes later, I happened to glance up to the eastern sky once again, wondering if the two lights I saw were still there.  Indeed they were, but they were moving horizontally across the sky from south to north fairly rapidly at about a 65 degree angle to me.  Then, the lights immediately began to do all sorts of strange things that you would not associate with normal aircraft.  They dove down like a roller coaster and then swooped back up in a sharp climb.  The drop was to about 30 degrees and then back up.  This repeated – down, up, down, up –sharp and fast.  There were other quick motions that I’ve never seen any aircraft do – quick changes of direction on sharp angles, for example. Again, all of the movement of the paired lights was done at a high rate of speed.   The object(s) then rose to about 60 degrees and took another sharp, high speed dive and went below my field of vision – the buildings of the shopping center not allowing me to see to the horizon -- and did not return. Overall, I would describe the general motion of the object(s) or lights if you will, as almost entirely random in direction, moving as I said at a high rate of speed.  Total duration of this portion of the sighting was about 20 seconds.  I had a smartphone with me, but I was too transfixed by the incredible movements of the objects to get it out and start to record it. Also, during the entire time of the sighting, I heard no noise from the direction of the lights. I thought that this might be a model aircraft, but not hearing any noise at all – along with the lights – eliminated that possibility.  IN FACT, there was a hobby shop in the shopping center that featured remote-piloted model aircraft and I went into the shop and asked the owner of the shop if he knew anyone who’d fly these craft at night.   He said he didn’t know of anyone who would.  Second, I asked him if it was common to put lights on the craft.  He said the craft he sold didn’t have lights attached.  So with these questions and the noise factor, I think I eliminated the possibility that it was a model aircraft. In addition, aircraft do not have red and blue lights.  Or lights that don’t flash. Obviously, the object wasn’t a normal airplane with capabilities as we commonly associate with them nor was it a helicopter either.  Because of the description of the flight of the paired lights and that I was not able to see a body, fuselage or anything else that the lights were physically attached to, moving in the manner that they did,   I decided that I had seen what could be described as a UFO and made this report.",2014-01-24T00:00:00,34.20418422535211,-118.84774873239436

It was either gaining in altitude or entering clouds.  The direction it was heading was due west.  A second red cross/X appeared seconds later a few degrees south of the first one. This one passed the first one on the north side.  Both of these red crosses/X’s appeared to be climbing in altitude or entering the upper clouds.  Through the tree line I could see two more red crosses/X’s appearing.  All four were heading due west.  I ran inside our house grabbed my Swarovski’s and asked my wife to come and look at these red crosses/X’s; which she did.  It took me maybe 30 seconds to run inside and back out, by then only one red cross/X was visible with our eyes.  As I was looking through the binoculars at the fourth red cross/X it did not look red or like a cross/X, it had a yellowish looking l! ight/beam in the center and a hazy/aura on the outside of the light.  As this passed over head of me I continued following it using the binoculars.  The light was disappearing and then I could see it actually take shape which looked like a dark dome shaped canopy as I continued looking at it.  It was heading west, and looked like a large black umbrella moving across the sky.  These objects did not make any aircraft noise or any noise at all.  About 20 minutes after the four objects disappeared I heard aircraft flying overhead heading west. This whole process was 5 minutes in duration.

Its brightness gave the distinct outline a glow that made the object appear nearly twice the size of the distinct outline.  I spotted it over central/western???  Florida from 8:10pm to about 8:13pm 02.02.2014 from Treasure Coast, Florida.  Object was originally moving NNNW from the vicinity of the southwest everglades, possibly the west coast of Florida??? and almost imperceptibly faded off to NNW... somewhere around 10-15 degrees when passing Tampa direction/area??? dead west of the Treasure Coast. The object was much larger than any known aircraft and was moving much faster than ! any normal jet... and not very high in the atmosphere like you would expect from experimental trials. At first I was able to clearly make out the outline within the glow but then the outline was obscured into an orange-red blob as the distance increased. Object disappeared as if headed to western FL panhandle. Afterwards, the sighting was followed by what appeared to be individual rockets launched about two minutes apart seemingly originating from SW FLorida coast at approximately 8:30, 8:32 and 8:34pm and more launchings at 10pm. Cannot confirm these times like I can the original sighting until I check my camera. Repeated launchings were sighted past 10pm. The later sightings of the much smaller, much slower ""rockets""??? were traveling in a more westerly direction towards the Gulf. The first few rockets started out in a more northerly direction and later rockets veered further west. I only say rockets because two of them appeared to have ""staged"" a booster separation soon after sighting. Booster separations??? were consistently timed/located/dropped SWW off west coast of FL and rockets??? disappeared on various trajectories from NW to NWW towards Gulf). Of the multiple ""rockets""??? seen... two clearly staged separations that were distinct... looking much like a short lived blue-white light being dropped like a bomb.  Both ""separations""??? ""drops""??? occurred in virtually the same location.  The ""rockets"" appeared to be reddish, and about 1/40th the size of the object ""disc""??? (flattened, pointed football shape). I took pictures of both the disk??? and the rockets??? but I was late on the draw and the distinct outline had already blended with the glow prior to my first shot.  I was not able to time the photos with the actual staging??? of the rockets.  Videos of the rockets taken are useless.  No video of the original object sighting was taken during its brief sighting. I made the original sighting and managed to share the sighting with my dad after getting his attention.  The rocket??? launchings which followed were seen by the whole family. No noise was heard from any sighting.  Can provide images but I doubt they will be of any use.

My fiancee and I were traveling back from West Virginia to South Carolina on Sunday.  I had national guard drill on this weekend.   We left WV around 6-615pm because the snow storm started and I had to work Monday night and didn't want to be stranded and miss work.  It takes about 2-3 hours to get to the East River Mountain Tunnel where this occured.  (Bluefield WV - Bland County Virginia I-77 southbound).  We exited the tunnel which enters Virginia - Bland County?  Not 100% on that.   After exiting I looked to the right because cops/state police usually sit there and a car passed us going over the speed limited which is why I looked there.  The next thing I remember I was facing forward without remembering changing the way I was looking.  It almost looked like it was daylight outside, but the light seemed like a white light with a extremely light haze/fog.   During this time I remember thinking why is it light outside its 9-10pm at night in the winter, then a bright flash came over and the light was gone.   My fiancee next said did the car just die or are the lights off?  We both looked and the car was still running and the lights were still on, the transition from the bright light to just the car lights may have caused us to think the car died or the lights were off.   We had also slowed down from about 55 mph to about 35-40 mph, as well as the car in front of us and cars in the opposite lanes.  This is when we questioned what just happened it all seemed to happen in a short amount of time.  I remember looking back and the tunnel was not in sight...which means we traveled a good distance in this white light before the flash and us slowing down and it seemed like several minutes passed by during this.   Has anyone else experienced something like this?   I would also like to add I saw a strange formation of lights with no particular pattern that we both saw in Charleston, WV, about 2 hours before exiting the tunnel.

The photo shows this bright ball of light but within the light there is a definite outline of some sort of craft.  I wish my daughter and I would have grabbed my camera and took video or pics before they left!  But we were too busy freaking out.   It was definitely not a plane or helicoptor.

I was riding my bike home from work on a very clear night. Being the first night in quite a while without any wind blowing, I took my time riding home and was enjoying the nearly full moon and the surrounding stars, although there were many city lights and most stars were not visible.  So it caught me off guard when I saw what appeared to be three very bright, orange stars at a very close distance.  When I first saw them, they appeared to be in a straight line, quite similar to Orion's Belt.  I remember thinking ""hmm that's weird, Orion's Belt is over there..."".  I slowed my bike to a stop for a better look and quickly realized that they were not stars at all, but something flying within Earth's atmosphere. Once off my bike, it was clear that they were moving.  Within 20 seconds, the center one had moved away from the others so that they were flying in what seemed to be an isosceles-triangle formation.  Each of the UFOs were circular in shape.  They had alternating red and yellow lights around the outside of the bottom, and the tops looked white or metallic and extended maybe 5-10 feet beyond the bottom part with the lights.  They did not appear to be spinning, but gliding effortlessly North. They were flying at a pretty slow pace so I decided to get my phone out to try to get some video of the event.  Unfortunately, my phone didn't have enough battery life to capture anything.  While I was getting my phone out, one of the crafts started to drift away from the others, heading East.  I watched it for a few seconds before looking back for the others. They sat still.  I returned my gaze on the UFO heading East.  The top part started to expand, almost like a hot air balloon, and then the whole craft started to descend, heading East the whole time. I looked back for the othes to see if they had done the same. I could only find one, which was heading South and its lights appeared to be getting dimmer. Looking back at the remaining UFO quickly,  I watched as it got lower and lower, and it actually seemed to pick up speed as it fell.  I didn't blink.  This thing just kept falling.  I'd say it only took about 30 seconds once it was ""inflated"", but it felt like minutes.  I watched until it fell over the horizon, behind some buildings way across town.  I was in the center of Ames, and I'd guess it fell East of the city, maybe 20 miles from where I was.  That is, IF it actually fell and landed somewhere.  If it were a plane, helicopter, or any other man-made flying vehicle, it defintely would been a crash landing, but I don't think it was. As soon as it was out of my view I searched the sky for any sign of the other two, but there was nothing.  I hopped back on my bike and headed home again, keeping my head up, enjoying the moon again.",2013-12-23T00:00:00,42.04085172413793,-93.61238318965519

The object made no sound. The object made a floating and hovering movement above the trees, probably 50 feet above ground level---so, right above the trees.  This happened for a minute and a half. After the horizontal hovering above the trees, the object turned upwards towards the sky and elevated straight into the sky at a slow pace for about 40-50 seconds.  As the object turned upwards to face the sky, it appeared to look like a triangle for a brief moment (this was nighttime, so it was hard to tell), complete with a reddish light towards the back. I only managed to get one picture of the object. It took me over a minute to get my digital camera set up in my car, and by the time I took the picture, the object was at least 20,000 feet into the mostly cloudy night sky. In the picture, the object looked exactly like a circular orange orb with a slight blur on one side because the object continued to do that very subtle back-and-forth hover that it did when it was hovering horizontally/parallel to the trees. After looking at the picture itself, it’s safe to confirm that it definitely wasn't a satellite, search and rescue helicopter, jet, plane, Chinese lantern, flare, or any other “logical explanation”.  It was a UFO. The object was intriguing, which led me to pull off to the side of the road on the northbound lane to stare at it and send this report a few days later.  The reason I was in the northbound lane was because that was the direction I was headed in my car.  I rolled my window down, gathered my digital camera and tried to set it up as fast as I could to start taking pictures.

The lights looked to me to be about a hundred to a hundred and fifty yards across from the light furthest south to the light furthest north while they were in the v formation.  If the lights were indeed over the New Glenn, they were only about 1/8-1/4 mile away, and they seemed to be just over the tree line to the west of the highway.  We rolled down the windows and didn't hear any typical aircraft noise.  There was typical traffic noise, but at that proximity I would have expected to hear something from them if they were helicopters. My son who I had tried to contact was working at the time, but he said that he saw orange lights in the same general area as he was driving home from work at around 11:20.  I neglected to ask him how many. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2014-01-10T00:00:00,61.2149,-149.2583

I spotted four unidentifiable orange lights in the skies above 1525 SE Geary St, located in Albany Oregon. 	A small orange light, about equal in size to the lights you might see on a passing airplane and at about the same elevation, was seen suspended in place in the west sky, alone and unmoving.  Two of my co-workers spotted the light and we observed it for approximately a minute before a second orange light appeared to rise slowly from directly below the first light, and then moved into place just to the left (south) of the first light.  Once in position directly left of the first light, the second light stayed motionless in the air, the same as the first.  We observed these two lights for about five minutes, until the second light traveled increasing its elevation while moving away west, until it was no longer visible.  The first light remained in it's position. 	Almost immediately after the exit of the second light, a third light, of equal size and hue as the first two was spotted in the northeast sky, at about the same elevation and distance from our location as the first two.  This light also remained motionless in the sky.  We observed this third light as well as the first for another minute or so before a fourth light appears in the sky to the right (east) of the third light and just slightly above it.  This light again was the same hue, size, and height as the first three lights.   The light remained in position next to the third for about two to five minutes before traveling up in elevation and away from us towards the northeast, in the same manner as the second light.  About five minutes after that, the third light disappeared, heading up and away just as the third light had done.  The first light remained in it's position for another few minutes before also traveling up and away in the westward direction, just like the secon! d light. 	All of the lights were the same hue, size,  and distance from our position.  The light was orange, like the color of flame, and solid, not blinking.  The lights all moved very slowly and in directions a commercial airplane could not, such as straight up.

Then it dawned on me I had not seen a bright star in that part of the sky.  It was approximately 60 degrees up.   After looking I thought it must be a plane.  The area I live in has many military bases were planes and land and take off through out the day and night. There is a Coast Guard Base about 50 miles away in North Carolina and helicopters fly to the Norfolk Naval Base.  We also have the Norfolk Internationl Air Port where commercial planes land and take off so I thought nothing of it. Later I looked at the object again and it was closer at about the same angle. I wondering why it was so bright then concluded it must have its landing lights on.  I could not see the red and green flashing lights on the wings and thought the landing lights were blocking them I turned and went back playing with my dogs.  There were other planes in the area I could see their flashing red and greenl lights on the wings.   Some were making their turn for Norfolk Airport and otheres heading towards other places. I looked again and the object made a slight course change rather quickly.  It was not a big move but was abrupt.  As I took my dogs back to the house I glanced again at the object and realized it was not a plane.  The total time I had been and outside playing with the dogs and watching this object was about 10 minutes. While in the house I grabbed my Nikon 10x50 binocluars went out side and observed the object through the binocluars.  At this time it was at about an 80 degree angle almost directly over me, I had to lean against a post on my porch to steady the binocluars. It was bright white with a haze around the edges and in the shape of a circle.  I called my wife and asked her what she thought that was pointing to the object she replied a plane.  I handed the glasses to her she looked and said on my God.  Then she said it was gone. I grabbed the binocluars found the object whchi had moved in a North East direction very fast it was no a pin point of light orange in color and about 20 to 30 degress.  It got smaller appeared to go in to a haze then it was gone.  From the time I took the glasses and the object disappeared was from 5 to 10 seconds. I have thought about this and believe the object was above the Earths' atmosphere. The bright white was a reflection off of the objects surface.  That would also explain why there was no sonic boom when the object sped away.

Initially I thought it might be a small plane from UND or perhaps a military craft from the nearby Air Force base.   However, I ruled these out when I noticed no red or green wing tip lights, and because the object was so large, moved slowly, and without sound.  I watched the craft move slowly across the southeast side of town before it disappeared in the distance.

I was up late and watering the grass at the small apartment complex I live in.  I was facing east and across the street there is a parking lot.  In the northwest corner area of this lot there is a tall evergreen-like tree.  I just happened to look up at the sky in that direction as I often look at the sky when watering the grass at night. Positioned above the tip top of the evergreen tree I saw what looked like a large bright star.  It looked like just a typical star, white in color, but noticeably larger, like six stars together.  It was not physically over the tree, but its position in the sky was above the tip of the tree.  I must admit I go a little alarmed because I had heard about alien abductions.  I decided to communicate with it.  But I did this inaudibly.  I sent a thought/question to it and asked if it was from the Christ (meaning Jesus).  And, if so would it blink off and back on again. The star dimmed down, like it had a dimmer switch, until it was not visible and lit up again. I then asked if it was here for the rapture.  The star dimmed down again, but this time it dimmed down and lit up twice; and, the second lighting it appeared brighter than before. I need to add that sometime during this occurence, a young man was walking across the street going southbound and I asked him if he could see that huge star.  He said something inaudible and smiled/laughed and kept walking. As I kept watching the star, it started to slowly ascend upward.  As it was doing this, off to the right, another star (this one was like an ordinary star in size) started ascending upward and to the left, like at a 45 degree angle as if going toward the larger star.

UFO REPORT  Date:  Friday March 21.  Time of event:  7:56pm – 8:11pm.   Country:  Dominican Republic City:  Santo Domingo.  1km from the center of the city. Location:  Roof of my house. Weather Conditions:  50% cloudy. Temperature:  Hot and humid (approx. 28°C). Wind and Cloud direction:  South to North Description of the local sky condition:  Strong light pollution   DETAILED DESCRIPTION  1)	  First sighting of what seemed like a normal ISS satellite overhead pass on a South-North destination.  Speed was typical of an ISS normal pass.  Strange that this small extended “object” could be observed through small low cumulus clouds.  The ISS seldom allows you to observe it through clouds.  Its color was pale yellow and not so “starlike” and pinpoint as I´m accustomed to observe the ISS or any normal satellite.  I describe it´s trayectory as in  polar orbit.  Magnitude was probably  -1 to -2    2)  	A short time later I observe, in the south-east, a smaller and dimmer polar orbiting satellite, more starlike, travelling at normal satellite angular speed.  It looked more normal to me. 3)  	As I was lying on a reclining chair I stood up to go downstairs and into my dormitory. 4)  	I suddenly noticed two bright (mag: -1) “stars” travelling in a parallel South-North polar orbit and separated about 15° or arc. 5)  	Following these two “leading lights” my eyes had to refocus to make sure I was observing countless smaller luminous starlike and white objects follow these two leaders.  They were less bright than the first original object and probably of magnitude +1 or +2. They were probably two to three dozen luminous objects which all shared a tendency to slightly zig-zag in uncorrelated manners respect to each other.  Their speed was similar to the other sightings.  All, so far, have appeared to be upper or mid atmosphere phenomena. 6)  	Following the cluster I detected what seemed, like a slightly larger repetition of the first object.  It was definitely an extended object, not pinpoint, and with a warm yellowish-orange tint. 7)  	I suddenly realized I had enough sky to dare getting my binoculars. 8)	  I ran down the stairs and entered my nearby dormitory to grab my high quality Russian 8 x 32 binoculars.  I keep my optical equipment in good condition always. 9)	  As I returned to the roof I realized I had time to calmly point and focus on the brighter extended object.  The binoculars were already focused for my eyesight on both eyes.  I rapidly adjusted for inter-pupillary distance. 10)	  As I was able to focus on the object with enough extension and angular size to discern details, good focus and definition, I identify the object as follows:    a)  	It was composed or configured by an agglutination of brilliant points. b)  	Between all these brilliant points there seemed to be a glowing glare not due to optical light scattering or dispersion.  It seemed more like a “plasma of some kind”. c)	  All these small lights were “locked” in spatial positions respect to the others. d)	  All these lights rolled or rotated along an horizontal axis just like a wheel would do on the ground. e)	  All lights revolved around this common axis as though they were attached to some invisible bonding structure.  They always kept their relative positions with respect to each other. f)  	I tried to share this experience with a friend and dialed his cell phone number.  This was a mistake as I admit and realize I should have taken this experience to its end without interruption.  The unidentified object occulted behind overhead clouds and was never seen exiting the group of clouds.   I stayed for 10 or 20 minutes more and noticed no more activity.

Ahead of me (a hundred meters perhaps) I saw a cluster of five lights in several indeterminate/shifting colors moving rapidly from east to west about 10 meters above the freeway, in a downward trajectory.   Then as my car reached the place where the lights were coming down, I slowed down, and observed through the driver's side window as the lights seemed to fold into themselves and lift up again abruptly into the air.   I looked back at the car's outside side-mirror and saw the lights continue to ascend behind me in the far distance.  Then suddenly (within one second) again I saw them directly through the side window, parallel to my car, only about 10 meters above the ground; and then they zoomed across the freeway at a sharp angle in front of me (perhaps 50 meters in front of me), going from west to east, ascending rapidly and vanishing from my ! sight. As I say, the lights ""folded into themselves.""  What I mean is that I didn't perceive this as a solid object or ""craft"" with a particular shape, with lights mounted on certain features of it, etc., as one would see on an airplane.  The lights were just lights, flying in a formation that remained generally triangular; but with additional dimensions.   They continued this ""folding"" and ""unfolding"" the whole time I observed, though at first I didn't perceive it that way.   I didn't perceive there to be any ""mass"" to it, apart from the lights.  The lights sort of catapulted and cartwheeled within themselves, inside a certain defined space that itself was in motion.  Over the course of a few seconds, my thoughts evolved as follows:   1. Is that an overpass up ahead with a big truck crossing it? I think it's crashing!   2. Oh wait, it's some kind of airplane, coming in to land, is there an airport right there on the left? I don't think so... I think it's crashing!   3. Oh, it didn't crash, it's flying very acrobatically; maybe it's a crop-duster?  At night?!   4. Ha!!! This is definitely a UFO! Those lights are moving very strangely! Where's my camera... OK found it... Too late, damn it, it's way back there now... I bet I see it again though... Ha! Here it is again!!!   If I were to compare the motion of the lights (& their folding/unfolding) to something I've seen before:  I would say it resembled the motion of ""nunchakus"" (the Chinese martial arts weapon) when being used by an expert.  As you may have seen in old Bruce Lee films, nunchakus are essentially two sticks connected at one end by a short chain.  Imagine that there was a light on each end of both sticks, and one on the middle of the chain; imagine that an expert was using them, but in somewhat slower motion than usual.  That's roughly how it looked as they wheeled about through the air. Another weapon that the lights and their motion resembled is the ""primitive"" hunting tool, the bolo.  Two or three rocks are tied together in a certain way, and hunters skillfully throw this cluster at the target. It is sort of like a boomerang, but with less form. I could also suggest that it's motion was like something you might see in a very simple kaleidoscope. I did not notice any particular sound associated with what I saw. If I were to estimate the size of this cluster of lights: Perhaps 5-10 meters in diameter at any particular moment? As I say, it didn't seem to be a solid object. By the time the lights came ""back"" to me I had found my camera on the seat beside me. I took one picture through the side window and one through the front windshield. Both pictures came out poorly; it was dark inside the car, the lights were moving and I was holding the camera rather unsteadily as I drove. In the picture through the side window, one sees two parallel streaks of light, moving horizontally but beginning to ascend. They look like two snakes, racing. In the picture through the front, the lights look like bright parallel streaks, sort of curved, ascending sharply. At the time, I didn't perceive them this way. I think the streak-effect is from the motion of the lights, the motion of my car, and my camera's slow ""automatic"" shutter speed in the dark. It should be noted that there are several military airfields in the region, including at least one where testing of aircraft takes place (or used to take place).  The Crow's Landing Naval Auxiliary Landing Field, which supposedly closed in 1999, is about 70 miles to the northwest.  Many experimental aircraft were tested there, including projects with NASA.  I find evidence, though, that NASA may still be doing things at this base, despite the fact that its buildings have been demolished.   On a web site dedicated to ""Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields"" of California, there is the following comment (corroborated by a map-detail):  ""Even though Crows Landing is labeled as closed on the March 2013 Sectional Chart... a note still indicates “NASA flight test operations conducted in this area below 2,500' MSL.”    Another military airbase in the region is Lemoore Naval Air Station, about 60 miles southeast. Conducting military test flights (especially of secret bizarre aircraft) at such low altitudes and high speeds, so near to hundreds of cars driving north and south on the freeway, would seem an incredibly stupid idea.   Even so, it may still have been an experimental military or NASA aircraft of some kind, perhaps a newfangled ""drone.""  Or perhaps it was something else.",2014-03-27T00:00:00,36.8524,-120.5467

I guess as an experiment I'll order a Chinese lantern and send it off from the beach to see if it looks the same as these did.  My husband think that's impossible because of the speed at which they were moving.   Also, they seemed to fly in formation.  He  thinks they are helicopters from the military base nearby, but even with binoculars I couldn't see a helicopter-and there was no sound.  Seems like if a light on a helicopter was close enough to see with the naked eye, you could hear it and see it with binoculars.

On April 12th, 2014, in Quincy, MA (near Wollostan Beach), I witnessed a spectacular event, to which I have no explanation. I first witnessed 3 distinct orange orbs in a triangular formation that soon became dispersed in a very subtle, and fading in and out-floating way.  I honestly thought I was just seeing things, but decided to grab my Ipad and record the following event:  Recorded via Ipad(although unfortunately, 10 times illegible versus the naked eye) I was noticing multiple reddish-orange orbs pulsating and maneuvering at odd trajectories.  They were lighting up the sky- many many many of them!  It was as though some of them would hover and some would skip in the sky.  Sometimes leaving visual traces of their flight paths….. Some would hover, some would move in right angles and zip amongst the sky, some were pulsating, some were moving in what appeared to be in formation- sometimes forming distinct geometric patterns, some flashing in and out of focus, some turning slightly different colors- such as green-amber glows, etc. That very night, the moon had a very peculiar glow and a mist or cloud formation that took on the shape of a beautiful circle of clouds or something equivalent. Just so you know, I am an artist and an art professor at a respectable college, and my eyes are very keen to subtlety.  I honestly thought that most of what I was seeing was perhaps due to retinal fatigue, but when I went inside after the orange orbs, I decided to Ipad-video record this event. I do not claim to see little green men.  I do not claim to have seen an ET.  I DO CLAIM THAT I SAW SOMETHING VERY VERY VERY PECULIAR AND VERY VERY ODD, THAT SEEMS TO BE AN INCREDIBLE VISUAL PHENOMANOM- whether it was natural or something else (even UFO like)  I have seen footage of Japanese/chinese lanterns, Aurora Borealis, flares, weather balloons, jets (as my father was in the military- I used to live in Fort Bragg, NC), drones, etc,..     and NONE OF THESE FIT THE BILL!!

The sky was clear. As I looked to the south  I saw an object that I will say looked like a little pure white marble moving horizontally at about 30 degrees above the horizon.  At first I thought it was a small airplane but staring at it revealed nothing betraying shape (fuselage, wings, tail)- none of these.  It seemed like a round sphere, pure white and not reflecting flashes of sunlight as planes often do, just a dull white color.  It moved along at an absolutely steady rate parallel to the horizon.  No sound came from it nor was there any trail visible behind it. I watched it proceed  smoothly  along  for about  ten to twenty seconds and then ran over to the door and yelled for my wife to come and see.  By the time she and I got to the vantage point it had disappeared. I thought immediately, “Ok, cloud cover.”  Then I realized, th! e sky was clear.  I don’t know if it vanished, flew away, winked out or what.  All I know is that in the ten seconds it took me to go to the door, yell and return it had gone.  (And it could not have gone into the clouds because there were none.)  I have often seen satellites flying overhead at night and this was about the right shape, size and behavior for one of those…so it you can see satellites in the day time maybe it was a satellite.  My impression was that whatever this was was flying at about eight to twelve thousand feet at a distance of about one to three miles from my vantage point.  I do not feel I can estimate its speed except to say that it was proceeding about as fast as a small plane would.  No erratic movement.",2014-01-24T00:00:00,28.8791,-82.2193

I looked up to the space station as i always do and just to the right of it but closer to me than the station about 1-2 miles no more i saw a triangle with three lights one to the front and two to the back? they were bright lights not the usual lights you see on planes, much brighter. My first thought was thats a big plane but comparing it to the two that was nearby, what i was watching was not a plane because the way that it was flying, it was moving faster than the two planes i was comparing it with, it was very big and with no sound. As we all know we can here planes for miles and what happens when it goes past you here the raw ((sic.  Roar)) of the engines, this had no sound either coming towards me, or when it past. One other thing i would like to mention is when i lived in the UK i had a bungalow and i took photo's of the star constellations but without the flash so that i could see the stars, and when i went in i looked at the photo's on my camera but could not see a lot so i put them onto the computer and magnified them about 100 and took it up to 400. By this time i was beginning to see the stars and other shapes, i know it sounds funny but they were like different size buttons!! i first thought it must be me doing some thing wrong so the following night i used my tripod a full size one and to my astonishment they were there again. I tried a few nights later  and used the tripod and this time i could see the stars as before but their were several blurs ? and i came to the conclusion that if the stars were visible that tells me that the blurs were moving. I hope that some of you nice people out there please try the camera at night with no flash and let me know what you find.  You never!! know!!

I then saw a black object moving in roughly the opposite direction of the aircraft I was in.  The object was flying a bit higher, but within a few hundred feet of the altitude of my aircraft.  We had reached cruising altitude, which for a domestic flight may have been approximately 20,000 feet.  I estimate the object's distance as approximately 1,000-2,000 yards away from the aircraft I was in. The object's shape was rounded.  Not a sphere, but with width and height that were approximately the same length.  The object had rounded details that protuded both from the sides and from top to bottom.  The object was very dark black in color. At first glance I thought the object was another plane moving the opposite direction.  As I continued observing the object I saw that it was moving at a pace that was unusual.  It was at that time I also mentally noted the object's black shape and unconventional shape.  It was moving in a very straight line at a fast pace, one that did not seem at all consistent with an commercial or known military aircraft.  The pace of the object surprised me and made me observe it more closely. At this time, after observing the object for less than 10 seconds, I looked down at my phone briefly, for only a second or two.  I then looked immediately back to where the object had been and it was nowhere to be seen.  When I had looked down, the object was not about to pass behind my place and out of sight.  I was startled to see that the object was no longer in the sky, and leaned forward to look out of the window farther towards the front of the airplane, where I could look farther behind us.  The object was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2014-02-07T00:00:00,,

At approximately 4:00 p.m., I went out to sit in my car to take a lunch break but stopped before I got to my vehicle to chat briefly with a co-worker.  I happened to be looking north toward the Muldoon base gate and saw two huge balls in the sky hurdling to the ground.  They were bright red, yellow, and pink (the sun was setting, so that could explain the color) and were traveling/falling at the same speed right next to each other.   To me it seemed they were approximately 100 to 200 feet apart, but I have no way of gauging the distance from one another, nor how high in the sky they were, only that they were falling fast, as though they were crashing to the ground.  They could have been meteors.  I watched them fall for about five minutes before the clouds obstructed the view. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, Hmm...definitely weren't contrails. I'm an Air Force brat and have lived on air force bases my entire life (and still do) and have seen every imaginable jet in the sky from A-10 Warthogs to F-22s, and this was like nothing I have ever seen.  I watched the sky for quite some time afterwards and saw no aircraft flying.  These balls of light were vivid red and very distinctively circular in shape.  It was around 4:00 Alaska time, which means the sun was starting to set, but it was by no means dark out.  There was a short trail of light following the objects that like I said were yellow, pink, and red, but the objects themselves were red.   The fact that I watched them in the sky for five minutes tells me they must have been way up there.  As I watched them, I assumed they were meteors, it's just that I have seen meteor showers in the past and they always had long ""tails"" and were much more brief, and weren't nearly as colorful.  Also, they came down almost completely vertically, slow enough that at times it seemed like they were suspended in the air.  Have you heard of large meteors like this?

At arms length it was the size of a quarter.  As I watched it move, I ruled out that it was a plane, helicopter or blimp, as it changed direction spontaneously.  It was so mesmerizing to witness something that my mind could not logically comprehend.  When I decided it was a UFO it darted to the east, then vanished without a trace.  There was no smoke or sound, but I kept looking to watch it reappear. it never did.  And then I basically thought that I was crazy!  No, not really!

We were 100% sober (even as this was later in the evening on New Year’s Eve).  Driving south on Barbur Blvd very near home my friend (the driver) exclaimed that there was a bright orange object in the sky up over the car.  I quickly looked up to see the very bright orange object, brightly lit and moving very slowly from the west side of the road in an easterly direction.  I told the driver to stop the car but it really wasn’t safe to do so until we arrived at our driveway about a minute after. Upon jumping out of the car the object appeared to move in our direction and seemed to flare up in brightness slightly.  It was immediately obvious this was something quite unusual and unconventional/non-ordinary.  In the distance, I noticed a small aircraft (just the lights) approach in our direction from the SW somewhat toward the object and I remember wondering if the pilot was actually seeing this object and attempting to come closer to investigate.  The orange object (upon having moved essentially overhead where we were) suddenly then traveled upwards, becoming smaller and smaller (in the clear night sky) until it simply disappeared.  Interestingly, the small aircraft seemed to veer off of its seemingly interceptive trajectory at that time and proceeded to fly almost straight north and eventually disappeared from view. We then went indoors and put everything away to settle in for the evening.  After about 15 minutes I suddenly felt the need to go back outside again and found that the object had returned over our driveway (though likely several hundred feet up—I am a bad judge of distance, however), bright as ever.  It moved slightly and stopped a couple of times and by the time I got my housemate to come back outside again it seemed to quickly fade from view.  There were at least 3 or 4 more occasions in the next hour where I went back outside to find the object in the sky again, roughly in the same location.  I eventually stopped trying to go back outside once fog moved in to the area and obscured the sky and surroundings.  I estimate this to have been a little after 22:30 o’clock. The object made no sound, glowed with variable brightness/intensity—from quite brilliant to extremely dim, then brilliant again—with no flashing lights of any kind, seemed fairly large in size (certainly larger than a Chinese lantern…possibly larger than a helicopter) and appeared to move slowly/deliberately and/or hover rather than exhibit accelerative speed, except when it swiftly traveled straight up and disappeared the first time.  Although we initially somehow assumed it was probably spherical in shape it at times seemed to reveal a more elongated general appearance.  The darkness of the sky and the brightness of the object made this very difficult to clearly determine.  I also couldn’t help but feel it was somehow oddly “aware” of us standing there viewing it, as it appeared to be drawn to our location.  It seemed to make some directional movement toward me whenever I stepped outside to view it and it also seemed to flare in response to the attention and our efforts to! talk to it.  I am open to the reasonable possibility that this aspect of things may just be some sort of coincidence, however. I used my iPhone 5 to take a few quick snapshots, though the resolution (as is often the case at times like this) was fairly poor.  One picture does seem to suggest a more “rod-shaped” form when enlarged.  I attempted a zoom shot in one that seemed to exhibit a more “fuzzy spherical form”.  Another still seemed to resemble a “clustered spherical form”.  I will forward these pics to you in a separate email.",2014-01-10T00:00:00,45.4312,-122.7715

Facts:   On December 31, 2013, at approximately 21:40 hours, while looking up at a clear sky from the approximate location of 45.527205 N, -122.688007 W, I saw a small object that was brilliantly illuminated in a white color moving due Southwest from near Jupiter in the night sky in the direction of Orion’s belt.  Since the only scale I had for the object was the night sky and planets and stars, I could not determine the object’s size or altitude.  The object continued tracking Southwest for a few seconds, and as it did, it began to glow a bright reddish-orange color.  It could be best described as the color seen in NASA spacecraft re-entry animations. The object then made a precise turn when it appeared near the background of the Easternmost star in Orion’s belt, and at what appeared to be a nearly 45 degree angle toward the East-Northeast at a higher rate of speed and moved away from my line of sight.  I made an effort to re-acquire it visually, but was unable to do so due to a building blocking my view. I was unable to observe a specific object shape, and I do not know if there were several lights on it, or if it was simply one light. Observations:   I have listed the event duration as 5-10 seconds, however, I must admit that the sight of the object was immediately disconcerting since it did not behave in an aerodynamic way. The actual duration could have been simply 5 seconds, given the apparent rate of speed of the object. I estimated that rate of speed to be extraordinarily high, since I also estimated the altitude of the object to be high as well, given that I could not even determine its shape. It is important to note that the object moved in exacting straight lines both Southwest and East-Northeast. The object did not make arced or rounded movements. The object also did not demonstrate the motions of anything organic like a bird or insect. The immediate shift in motion of the object eliminated my first conclusion that I had witnessed a shooting star.  Also, the color on the object became brighter as it moved East-Northeast, rather than fading.  I have done an exhaustive search for any optical illusions that could explain the change of direction and found none. I want to disabuse anyone investigating this of the notion that I viewed this as a metaphysical or spiritual occurrence.  I did not “feel” the object, have “psychic communication” with it, or in any way view it as a sign or contact.  It was merely an observation of an object moving in a way that I cannot explain, and that startled me. I am able to make this report as a result of immediately recording the time, my location, and observations, since I maintain a personal and professional notebook while I am working.",2014-01-10T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

The objects stayed at the same altitude and were flying right next to each other, appearing to be in formation. I did not see where they appeared from but we did watch them travel across the sky over about 1 and a half minutes before disappearing. About 2-3 minutes later, 2 more appeared from the south heading on the same path. Again taking about 1-2 minutes before disappearing.  One was on the same course as the first two, and the other headed down and out of sight behind some trees.  I could not tell exactly how far away it was but seemed to be about a half mile to a mile to the west of my location.  I was able to get a video of that one on my phone, but it was pretty dark so there isn’t any perspective to the video.  After the first 4, I went inside and got my 2 sons to come out and they witnessed the last 3 objects we saw.  These all came one at a time.  Took about the same amount of time to travel across the sky and all disappeared around the same area as the first 3 that were going south to north.  They all seemed to be following the same flight path and appeared about 2-3 minutes apart. We waited and watched for more but that was all we saw that night.  This all took place over a period of about 15-20 minutes.  I have no idea what they may have been, but the consensus among us all was that they were not any sort of aircraft we had ever seen.

My daughter thought that they were hot air balloons or lanterns, and asked if you could release lanterns in the sky.   I looked over and saw them, but was unable to pull to the side of the road at that time as there was a car directly behind me.  At first I thought it may be a plane, as 2 of the lights seemed to be travelling together, and remained parallel and equal distance apart, similar to lights on a large plane.  I told her that it was a strange color but I was sure that it was a large plane from WPAFB as the lights were travelling together and appeared to be turning together.  Then the lights split.   Her phone would not video while we were moving.  I drove into a subdivision where we could stop and get out, by then there were 2 lights left to be seen.   We got a picture from her phone, then the lights were all gone.  They were not moving like a meteor of falling star.  Two were originally close to each other then split while the two others were farther away, but still all four were somewhat in a cluster.   I have never seen lights in the sky move like this, or this color.   We were unable to see a shape other than a round bright sphere, lights moving in unison and then separating, then disappearing.   I might add my father was an Air Force pilot, and I have lived on or near bases my whole life.   But these lights did not act like meteors, or planes and they disappeared while in the sky.",2014-04-11T00:00:00,39.827,-84.0187

Last night, I was a passenger, as my husband drove north on Loop One from south Austin.

Two of the approximate seven to nine lights were out of formation. The lights didn’t seem to be moving or moved very slowly while staying very near each other.  I’ve never seen aircraft fly so close together.  The number of lights caught my attention first and then the fact that they appeared so close together. The lights glowed a solid red and never blinked, as aircraft lights do. By the time we pulled into Zilker Park to watch, only three lights remained.  Slowly they blinked off one by one. About fifty yards away a man stood outside his car, dancing and screaming.  When he saw us he yelled, “Did you see that?”   My husband and I hurried to meet him and he said he had watched the lights for about ten minutes.  We saw them for about three to four minutes. The stranger, our new friend, said they first appeared on the southern horizon.  We both watched them travel to the southwest. He also said that twice he saw one light race to a second light and hover briefly before racing off at an unusually high rate of speed. My husband is sixty-seven and has practiced law for the last forty years.  I’m almost sixty, attended graduate school and was a stay-at-home mother.

I was returning to camp around 08:00 and noticed what I thought was the sun.  But I quickly noticed it was moving horizontal from my right to my left.   I hollered to my one son to turn and look at it.  He did see it. As I said it looked to be the size of the sun, but a dull orange color and took maybe 10 seconds before disappearing behind some trees at the far side of a large clearing in the woods.  It appeared to be a good distance away. I simply would like to know if anyone else saw this object.  I can't imagine so many people between us and Seattle area during the morning commute not seeing the same thing we did.  But, no report and I never made one myself.

Easily resolvable angular resolution which was unusual considering the fade-in.  Moving east to west. Looked a little like jet plane in traffic, looked about the right size and with lateral motion, but had no vertical stabilizer, no distinct wing shape.

On January 22 2014 at 2359 hrs.  I was loading my wood stove and on completing this I sat down to enjoy the fire when I looked out the bay window facing and easterly direction and saw something that was like a star but it was not.  That night we had a cloud cover moving in around midnight and I did not see any stars out.  This object was not moving at this time. I saw one red light at the bottom which my first thought was that it was a military craft. The light glowed like an aviation light.  The light would be bright and then drop to a lesser brightness but would never go out.  The object had three white lights one was to the right of the red light and one to the left.  These where evenly spaced from the red light and on the same level.  The third one was vertical of the red one and was spaced as the same as the ones right and left.  These white lights never changed their brightness stayed the same the whole time.  I was trying to understand the object not jumping to any conclusions. Then it moved from its location by dropping to the right at a 20 degrees angle.  Next, it changed its angle to complete to 45 degrees.  Finally, it went to a horizontal movement to the right. When this was completed, it went back to its location in same movement.  This thing stopped me from thinking it was something military.  The speed in which it traveled was very fast.  In a split second it traveled to its new location and the same speed back. This object as it appeared from the distance from where I was standing with a measuring scale was about 1/8 of an inch.  The length of its movement was about ¾ of an inch. The lights never changed its configuration, nor did the object rotate, or pitch.  The object in about ten seconds did this movement again which was a copy of its first.  I think in about 20 seconds it made this move the same as the last two, except it was to the left and it was the same.  The lights never changed, nor did the start location, but then! as clouds moved in I think caused the brightness to drop off.  Then the brightness came back to a full brightness.  Next, I only saw the top light because I think the clouds covered the bottom.  Finally, I think it was covered with clouds.  I sat there for an hour hoping it would be seen again, but it never did.  The total time that I saw this object was three to four minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2014-01-24T00:00:00,,

On 2/5/14 I was awoken to a loud sound that sounded like after burners of a rocket.  The noise was coming from right above our house and it shook our room.  My father was an airplane pilot and we have airplane's and helicopter's that go over our house frequently.  So, I am very familiar with the noises that they make when they travel over the air space above our home.   I knew right away that this was no airplane because I grew up around airplanes as my dad was a pilot.  The noise startled me because I never, ever had heard anything like that before in our area.   I got up looked out our large bay window from the 2nd floor of our house and couldn't believe what I saw.  I saw an object that was changing colors that was hovering and like floating westbound through the air.   My husband and son also got up and witnessed the object, and they couldn't believe what we were seeing.  The object changed colors from a beautiful emerald green, red, blue, orange and also to a white color.   We were so surprised to see such an object right in front of our own eyes that was so beautiful just traveling slowly through the air westbound towards Seattle.   We watched it and watched it, of all times none of our cameras were working.  While watching it at one point we did witness what appeared to be a helicopter approach the object.  They kept their distance from the object, they didn't get close to it.  The helicopter stayed back from it, again didn't get close to it at all and it finally it backed off and left the object alone.  The object appeared to be larger than the helicopter but not by much.   The object just seemed to hover in the sky slowly moving westbound.  We watched the object until we could no longer see it any longer.  We were shocked to see such an unbelievable site, and we have always been uncertain about if there are UFO's in the world or not.   After seeing th! is AMAZING BEAUTIFUL OBJECT, the three of us that watched it for the a pp. 44 minutes are believers!!  We would of never ever had the opportunity to witness such an unbelievable, AWESOME, site it the noise it had made when it was traveling through the sky hadn't awoken me again at about 2:00 AM, when we normally are sleeping.   We felt excited, had so many questions that we will never have answered and we did feel somewhat scared, as the questions go on and on. In the end we felt very blessed to see such a site, and again we now are believers in UFO's as our family had just seen one.   It shook our room and the noise was unbelievable.  Without the noise that it made in passing through the sky in the middle of the night, we would never ever witnessed such an astonishing site of a object that appeared to be a real UFO!!

I woke my son up and we stepped out on to the lanai.  My son grabbed his phone to take a photo and when he did the orb stopped dead in its tracks and hovered; bobbing up and down.  It had a central white/blue light that emanated outwards, red singular lights forming a circle around that, and  a lighter greenish glowing halo of sorts around that, as if it was in a bubble reflecting a green glow.   My son turned his phone off and a large shooting star went across the sky infront of it, leaving a line in a cloud.

March 8 2014 I was looking up at the night sky looking at a group of stars called in laymans terms the Saucepan which is a group of 7 stars.  The sky was clear with various thin,broken clouds when 2 triangular shaped objects appeared.  They were traveling in a northerly direction one behind the other.  Speed, height and size was hard to gauge as there was nothing in the sky to compare them to.  My best guess as to the speed would be faster than a commercial aircraft at cruising altitude but not as fast as a shooting star.   I live underneath one of the North Atlantic approach routes into London Heathrow.  The aircraft that I see overhead are usually at a flight level of around 26000 feet, these craft did not appear to be that high and appeared to slightly higher than the broken cloud base and you could still see them as they passed through the cloud.   If they were flying at around 5000 feet then I would estimate them to be the size of a Boeing 737 and traveling at a speed of around 500 m! ph.  There was no sound evident and no vapour type trail.  The shape of the craft was that of a slightly elongated triangle,rounded at the 3 points.   Neither of the craft had any lights and the best way that I can describe their colour would be a smokey grey/milky colour.  They both continued in a northbound direction,the rear craft flying at around the distance of 1 crafts length behind and seemingly at the same height and disappeared in to thicker cloud.  All of this observation lasted around 4-5 seconds.   I have been an avid aircraft enthusiast/spotter for the last 45years and know what an aircraft looks like in flight whether it be private, commercial or military irrespective of how high they are flying.  Where I live the aircraft on approach to London are at a height of around 26000 feet but can still be heard in the sky quite clearly,as do the other aircraft which pass overhead on their way to Europe at flght levels of around 33000-35000 feet.  These 2 craft were not audible at all.",2014-03-18T00:00:00,,

I pulled up to a stop sign at the intersection of two roads in a wooded suburban area.  It was 8pm and darkness obscured the fact that it was fairly cloudy.   I saw four yellow/orange lights 45 degrees up from me.  The color of the lights was immediately perplexing.   This area is a well-used flight path for the busy Minneapolis airport and is about 7 miles from there.   The lights I saw were about the color of sodium streetlights and solid - no strobing like one sees with commercial aircraft.   All 4 lights were slowly traveling west to east with little deviation from their path.  A single non-pulsing yellow/orange light was following a considerable distance behind the three other lights that when I first saw them were in a triangular pattern.   It was hard to ascertain their altitude as it was night.  Most of my attention was on the group of three lights.   As I watched the lights the shape of the formation changed.  The light in the back moved closer to the two front lights and the triangle turned more into a straight line.  All the while, the fourth light kept considerable distance.   The intensity and color of all four lights was constant throughout my observation.  At one point, a commercial aircraft bound to land at MSP was headed close to the formation and from my vantage point almost crossed paths.  It is hard to imagine that pilot would not have seen the formation. Eventually, the four lights passed almost out of my field of vision so I attempted to follow them to the east, but there was no road that would take me in that direction and I was never able to track them again.   In all, I saw the lights for about 2 minutes and got one minute of video on my cell phone including the time that the plane appeared the nearly cross paths with the lights.

They were almost side by side, the one on the left being slightly ahead of the other.  They seemed a bit bright, but I assumed they were military planes on a special mission for New Year’s Eve. As I started to drive towards the west, I couldn’t help but keep looking up at the objects. After three minutes, I was absolutely convinced they weren’t planes.  While looking over the tree tops further southwest, I thought I saw two more objects in the distance!  I drove a bit more to get a better view, but only the original two remained.  I pulled over to the side of the road, rolled down my window, and got out my phone to record some video.  The orange colored objects seemed quite small from where I was, but I could tell they were angular.  Perhaps triangle-like, their point located in the front of the craft.  They glowed like fire. The one on the right was still slightly trailing the other, but they were going at the same speed.  After a couple minutes, the UFOs faded into the darkness.  I did not get much at all on camera.

At first she thought they were birds flying way high up in the sky overhead but I have never seen birds act like that.  They were definitely fading in and out of view and moving in very circular motions.  I was thinking maybe there were some balloons released in the area into the sky?   Balloons could reflect the sun’s rays and would make a circular motion as described.  However, I have never seen anything like that in my entire life.

But the object moves very slowly and there are no contrails, and the object doesn't get any bigger (perhaps barely - I did notice what appeared to be a possible division or morphing of the orb).  In fact, it looked like it could have been a tiny cloud or balloon, but there was not a cloud in the sky, and a balloon would have been blown about by the light wind.   This object hovered, and came to within a 1/2 mile at perhaps 3-5,000', and remained stationary for at least 5 minutes.   I called to my neighbor, who also witnessed the white orb.  It slowly moved across a part of the sky above the airport, while several commercial aircraft flew about their designated routes, oblivious to its presence.   Anyway, my housemate came home, and he witnessed it too, as it started to move away, slowly at first, and then we saw it shoot rapidly up towards orbit.   I can saw without a doubt that this had to be either a military recon drone (unlikely), or an ET probe (or whatever kind of instrument they send when a mental CE5 contact is initiated - if that is what it was responding to).",2014-04-11T00:00:00,41.39098647450111,-73.47073769401331

Today is her day off and she was at home. A couple of hours ago, she called me (at work) in panic/excitement and said she observed a UFO when she stepped out of the house to get the dog.  From her words, she thought it was a plane that was sitting so low in the sky, she thought it was going to crash.   Then she noticed it was too big for a plane, didn't have wings and was not making any noise.  She said that it looked like a rocket.   It was moving slowly above the neighbor's house at a bird's flight height and she could see it was grey metallic (matte - not shiny, but the sun was out, it's been cloudy).  She saw the width of the machine, it was smooth overall, but had a large visible structure located towards the end of the body that looked like a propulsion system and some large symmetrical multiple tail type structure.   The machine was about twice the length of the plane and proportionally wider than the plane.  She was on the phone with her mother at the time, but could not turn on the camera on iPhone - it was not working. The machine then made a slow turn without changing altitude and went beyond pine trees on neighbor's property, blocking her view.  By the time my wife went around the neighbor's house, the machine just vanished in the sky.  The dog never even looked up and didn't notice the vessel in the air as it was totally quiet.

Because the UFO was inside the clouds, we could not actually see the shape of the UFO itself, but it appear to be of a round sparkling form about the size of a small aircraft.  None of my coworkers had any real clues to the exact identity of the UFO except just presumption without any proof.   The UFO was located just above the bottom part of the hurricane feeder cloud moving in an eastern direction against the prevailing wind.  It traversed a level course from the time I first saw it until the last time I saw it for at least two to three minutes.   Its speed is comparable to a slow flying plane, and I estimate the distant to the UFO from us to be about 1/2 a mile in distant and located above the ground at least 500 feet in altitude.   Occasionally, the UFO appeared to brighten up in sparkling light when it entered into a thin layer of clouds.   We never heard any loud noise being produced from the UFO, but the reason may be because all of us were inside behind the heavy glass windows.  I seen many planes travel into a group of clouds, and not once had I ever seen those planes sparkle.

The panels were moving independent of each other like they were fluttering.   I don’t know its width because the helicopter was partially obscuring it.  But I had to look quickly back down and keep shooting because we were taking fire. I am familiar with fixed wing and helo military aircraft, and work in a facility that repairs various military aircraft and have been doing so for 11 years.  What I saw that night above IRAQ  is unlike anything I have ever known, and I think of it to this very day.

Approximately 10pm on January 10, 2012, I was driving my car eastbound through town in Athens, IL.  I looked out of my window (south) and seen a very low flying object, about tree top high.  We are about 15 minuets from the airport in Springfield, IL, so my first instinct was that it was a plane, until it got closer.   I notified the passengers in the car to look out their windows on the opposite side of the vehicle as we came to a stop in the road and we all three watched out the windows.   As it moved over the top of us, we realized that this object was triangular shaped and had lights on each point of the triangle and was not moving at a very fast speed for a normal plane.   As we continued to watch, the object moved onward then turned into two seperate objects and took off extremely fast across the sky in two opposite directions.  One went northeast and one went west.   This was not the first UFO sighting I have seen, the first happened around 1999 just north of Petersburg, IL, at approximately 9pm (3 witnesses), but this UFO started out as an abnormally bright light high in the sky, it disappeared then re-appeared within a few minuets but closer.  We shined a 2 mile flashlight towards the object and it disappeared again.   We stared off into the sky in curiosity and suddenly, a large oval light, yellowish orange in color, appeared above our neighbors tree (approximately 1/2 football field away) it just hovered there without noise and another oval light appeared on the right side and one more on the left side of the first initial oval light.   The objects stayed there for only a mere 1-2 minuets and then disappeared.  This object moved fast, hovered, had no sound.   The way this happened, I feel that this object wanted our specific attention. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

About 1 min after that I saw a bright light flash in the cloud above us and 3 f-16 planes appeared parallel to each other moving in the direction of the orb.  Also this is probably unrelated by I should mention that right after that I witnessed 10-12 albino bats flying around within 20-30 feet from us.  About 2 hours after that, we were still there as another business partner showed up.  Around 11pm or sometime between 11-12, we all witnessed a second orb identical to the previous one.

Over a year ago, I believe I saw a UFO.  However, due to that night's events and how tired I was, I could be mistaken.   The night in question took place just after an article was released about US and Chinese naval ships dealing with USOs in the pacific off the coast of San Francisco.   I was listening to Clyde Lewis in Portland talk about the article and discuss various UFO sightings.  This is part of the reason I think what I saw may be wrong.  There is also the fact that near the beginning of my shift, I was working as a security guard at an apartment complex in Portland, there was some sort of big celebration taking place with giant search lights moving across the sky.   Additionally, I also hallucinate when I get very tired, however, I don’t recall be that tired during that particular night. Now, the search lights started their thing as soon as it got dark.  They were white beams and would reflect off the clouds when they came across them.  Nothing spectacular about them and they were out after a few hours.   Clyde Lewis’s show was still going for since time after they went dark.  His show was also still going when I saw a new green search light going across the sky.  At least I thought it was a search light as I watched it travel from the eastern horizon and disappear in to the west.   What changed my mind into thinking it was a UFO is that it traveled in a straight line, never returned and was clearly traveling above the clouds since it would momentarily disappear when it passed by one.  Thus, I am sure it was not the beam from a search light.  Also, the suspected UFO was moving very fast and seemed very large.  Also, its color was a solid bright teal.  So basically I think I saw a teal circle of light UFO. Now, had I just seen that light I could have written it off.  But, what happened a few hours later makes me wonder.   Clyde’s show was over and I had switched to coast to coast.  So the occurrence happened sometime after midnight PST.   Now this occurrence was the unusual appearance of 4, presumably black hawk, helicopters flying fairly low and over the same path the teal light took.  There was one difference though.  The 4 helicopters seemed to stop over the Willamette River for a couple minutes before separating.  One headed south.  Another north.  The third went North West and the final one stayed above the river for a few more minutes before continuing west. There you go.  That’s my potential UFO sighting.

One obviously behind the first and low, almost to the bottom edge of the first, and the other in a similar postion in front of the original circle/sphere. The surface of the circle/spheres was almost electrical.  They seemed almost uniformly bright but washed out white.  The electrical texture was not moving as electricty would, not moving at all.  The size was easy to determine by the position. They were before the mountains, the Sierrita Mountains. They sat between Hilltop Road and some where over or beyond the Three-points fire station.  The light from them did not affect the surroundings, as if not emitting light - but incredibly bright and uniform themselves. The first simply appeared, not there, then there.  The other two smaller objects appeared in a similar fashion.  They stayed there for about 15 minutes.  I was to scared to tell anyone. I was driving a small scooter at the time, no cell phone, no camera.  I drove back to Fullerton Road with these things to the right of me.  As I turned onto Fullerton, they vanished instantly as they had appeared. A car drove up at the intersection and saw me standing beside my scooter and asked if I was okay.  I said yes, wondering if they had seen it too.  I was too scared to say anything else.  They stayed for a few minutes, lending to my curiosity as to whether they did see it, and were to scared to mention it as well. I went home shaken, grabbed a camera, and accidently clicked it.  The flash was on, and it must have attracted the attention of a neighbor in that direction who must have thought I was spying on them, as they flashed a camera back towards me. I went inside, and let the incident go.  I am writing this nearly a year later, before I forget any of the details.

I live near the woods at SE25th and High Street, just West of I-35 in Oklahoma City.  I walked out into my back yard around 11pm to get some firewood for the overnight, and saw a low flying craft coming from the South, just a few hundred yards away right above the treetops.  It caught my attention because it was so low and had far too many lights for an airplane, as I could see around six or so bright white lights across the leading edge.  I soon noticed it had “points” of light coming out the bottom, so I put a hand over one eye to check that it wasn’t just blurred vision from the cold night air as it came into full view, unobstructed by the trees, and it was not blurred vision –I checked both eyes as it slowly approached.  As it drew nearer, passing due North, East of my position, the bright lights were also visible down the side of the craft, just as they had been from my view of the leading edge, and the “points of light” appeared to be multi-colored cones of light, three or four of them, coming from the bottom of the craft like a cone, with the point downward.  I continued to watch it pass at a few hundred yards away in the pitch black sky, and believe it was a saucer shape with large bright white lights surrounding the outer edge, the “points of light” pointing from the flat bottom center of the craft at a length of ten or twelve feet toward the ground.  From the rear of the craft I could see flashing lights in various places on the craft –none of which behaved like airplane lights, nor were they properly colored –just white lights. I believe it to have been a typical “flying saucer shape” like two tea cup saucers stacked together, possibly with a spacer in between, where the large bright white lights would have been.  I would estimate it to have been about thirty feet across. It flew absolutely silently.  Moved much too fast to be a blimp, but seemed to merely float in the sky, silently, slower than an airplane, but crossed my field of vision inside of thirty seconds, covering probably a mile or so before my view became obscured by buildings and trees in my  own yard.  This thing was close by, and not the first unusual craft I have seen appear to come from these woods over the many years of living here. ((ADDENDA FROM WITNESS)) 1.

I have lived in Las Vegas 18 years and am a middle school teacher. Last night around 6:30 I was lying in my back yard hot tub watching the clouds and enjoying a light drizzle. A perfectly circular black object moved silently across the sky, moving from due East to due West.  The circle was completely black, with no lights and no reflections of the lights below. I live a mile west of the Las Vegas Strip, near the Palace Station casino.  The object seemed to be following Sahara Boulevard. I watched it for 20 seconds or so,  until my view was obstructed by trees.  I was unable to determine how high it was in the sky, or how large it was.  However, it appeared to be skirting the base of the clouds.  Because it was raining lightly, the clouds were lower than normal.  Several times it looked to me as if the object disappeared into the clouds for brief instants. Because of the light storm, wind was to the east.  The object was moving in a straight line into the wind, which immediately seemed odd to me.  I don't think a balloon would have traveled in a straight course against the wind. Less than a minute later, a helicopter traveled the same course, from east to west.  The helicopter was traveling at appx. the same speed as the object had been.  I could not tell if the helicopter was a news copter, a police copter, or some other type.

She was in her late teens at the time of this event, around 1939.  She had a habit of telling the same stories from her youth over and over, but this one I was always delighted in hearing as many times as she cared to share it. My grandmother was in a car waiting with 3 other school mates before a play/musical type performance at her school.  They were a bit early, so they waited for someone to come unlock the school door.  I'm estimating around 8 PM, but she never said exactly, only that it was after dark. In those days, there were no street lights out in that remote area, so it was pitch dark.    Shortly after pulling up, they saw a bright light approach from the rear.  My grandmother was in the back driver's side of the car, and the light was approaching from the passenger's side rear.  They all assumed it was a flash light or car headlight of someone to come open up the door. The light got brighter, so bright that it filled the car interior with light.  It was so bright my grandmother said it was as bright as daylight.  They saw a glowing fireball, about the size of a basketball, or large melon, floating by the car, about 2 or 3 feet away from the car, moving forward on the passenger side about 4 feet above the ground at a slow walking speed. She said it was a great big, perfectly circular ball of ""fire"", yet it made no sound.  The girl next to her screamed, and they all got concerned.  They waited until it passed, and then the two guys in the front of the car got out and followed it.  My grandmother and her friend waited in the car, scared to go outside.  The fireball drifted into the woods and eventually out of sight, and the guys came back and said it had disappeared. Its height, size, color, brightness, or trajectory never varied, and it moved smoothly the entire way.  It truly perplexed them all, and they would mention it over the years.",,34.9444,-88.0212

My wife and I had picked up a friend, who lived a mile to the south, possibly an hour prior to the sighting.  The three of us went to visit a married couple maybe 7 or 8 miles away from where my wife and I lived off Highway 49, 4 miles south of Georgetown, CA.   When we got to the couple's small secluded house up a long driveway, we discovered only the woman was home; her husband was in the Bay Area on business.  We evidently chatted for awhile.  I recall looking at their posters fastened to the wall and I was admiring how flat and perfectly displayed they were.   The 3 of us left the couple's house, at the approximate time listed above, exited their driveway and began returning to Garden Valley.  Evidently we were at the intersection of Highway 49 and Garden Valley Green Valley Road.   The sky lit up.  I recall all heads (3) in immediate unison and perfectly coordinated lock onto the saucer (I was driving).  The trees were all lit up, the craft was above us slightly in front, visible through the windshield and off to the driver's side of the vehicle (a 59 Chevrolet Impala).  My thought were ""I could hit that with a rock.""   It began to move slowly from its forward position toward the rear of the vehicle.  I stuck my head out the driver's side window and watch it cruise overhead keeping its same altitude.  There was an inner ring with windows lighting up individually from left to right.   I kept my head out of the vehicle and followed the craft until it arrived beyond the rear of the car.  It disappeared as if a light switch had been flipped.   I remembered nothing.  It wasn't until 1978, probably, that the I began to remember the sighting.  By that time my wife and I had divorced and I was estranged from our daughter.  I was living then, in the Bay Area.   I had occasion to visit, with a friend from my work, friends of his.  They were watching television, a program I had never seen, Battle Star Galactica.  I could not watch, I panicked, I had to leave, get outside into the fresh air and! away from that program.   Fragments of the disk encounter began to quickly on occasion flash into consciousness over the following months.  In 1981 (?) I had moved back to my home town and the town where my ex-wife now lived also.  It came to pass that my ex wife, also recently separated from her second marriage, drove to Lake Tahoe California for an overnight at my new employer's cabin.  There were four of us in my car, the ex, her son by marriage number 2, and our daughter.  My daughter asks in route, ""Dad have you ever seen a flying saucer?""  I ask my ex wife, ""Have you ever seen a flying saucer.?  She replies, ""You ought to know.""  That was the end of the discussion evidently on that road trip.   It has been difficult to remember to ask her what she remembers.  I did ask her, ""Who was the 3rd person in the car with us.""  She said who she thought it was.  A couple of years later I asked, ""Why didn't we drive off the road and crash?""  She said, ""We were stopped.""   The fact that we stopped was in my report but I needed to ask, years later, I remembered zip.  I have yet to ask her when she began to recall the sighting.  The memory was evidently erased yet we were 'allowed' to recall the pass over.  At least that is all I can recall.   I did go under hypnosis, maybe 1984/5.  The psychologist asked me while under hypnosis what did I see.  ""I see us on the ground."" 3 standing by the car.  Then I said ""I see dead people in the dark.""   You just said on the Jeff Rense Show 02-14-14, why doesn't anyone who has been directly underneath a saucer report in even if its 8 decades.  At your service.  The event under the craft gets your memory wiped, at least in our too close for comfort encounter.   Don't get me wrong I consider myself exalted by this unique experience.",,38.8495,-120.8392
