Below is his story in his own words:  “We were watching the bodysurfers surfing the waves.  I was standing near this big rock right by the ocean, looking out over the horizon when I saw an orb that was bright white, almost like a florescent light bulb but sphere shaped.  The orb was about as big as a grapefruit.  It had come from thin air, going very fast but slowed to a halted hover in a very small space.   As soon as it slowed, it dropped an orb that looked the same as the other one but just bigger, like a soccer ball.  The bigger orb dropped in the water and made a small splash.  The small orb hovering in the air flew off and disappeared in a flash, literally.   I looked down at the water where the orb had fallen but there was nothing there even though I saw a little splash.   I looked in the sky again to see if there were more orbs.  I scanned the horizon and saw more of these occurrences but they were further away.  The first sighting was very fast, probably two and a half to three seconds long.  The other sightings lasted longer because the orbs traveled further than my first sighting.   Then, after the last orb (the fifth or sixth one) dropped its load of a larger orb, the orbs all vanished. “",2013-12-05T00:00:00,21.32260015003751,-157.84012865716429

Four friends watching the night sky from the yard when the object appeared in the west about 30 degrees above the horizon--it was unbelievably orange and bright, moving slowly toward us getting larger and brighter and often made split-second horizontal movements.   The object was totally silent and exhibited a shiny coronal light effect.   After the sighting we researched all comets/rocket launches we might have seen at that time, but none were at the right time or in the correct point in the sky.   It lasted for about two minutes before it faded and vanished. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Peter, The property where we had the sighting is at the end of a long road in New Paltz, leading to a somewhat remote location directly on the east bank of the Wallkill River.  The house faces the River just a few yards to the west. Our friends have a large stone fire pit and it's common for us to make a fire and sit around it after dinner chatting and enjoying the stars.  We had an unusually clear view of the western sky due to it being winter and all the leaves being gone.  We have seen satellites, shooting stars and many other aircraft over the years; even the international space station, which we confirm with the NASA website as to when it is passing by. I can't say we took note of Venus on Thursday evening because by the time we got out there,  plenty of bright stars were out.  However, tonight--Friday, we were out there an hour early and saw the very bright rising of Venus at around 5:30 PM. White , bright, & steady.  If you are familiar with the night sky upstate, you can't mistake it as anything else but a planet.  I've heard about folks mistaking Venus for a UFO, but this was not the case with us.  For one thing, Venus is in a totally different location in the sky: SSW.  Our fireball was out of the WNW as we were looking directly over the river at 6:50 PM Thursday night. At first, we all thought it was an aircraft with its landing lights on; but not white--orange--the color of flame.  It was pretty far away, looked like a couple of miles.  We realized this was no ordinary aircraft as it appeared to enlarge or come closer to us.  I thought it had 2 tiny white dot lights  inside and we all saw an ""aura"" or haze around the sphere.  One of us saw a red ""trail"".  The ""aura"" looked like the  suns corona during an eclipse.  It made several horizontal shifts to the left and right.  The shifts looked perfectly straight and sharp, like it was under guided control.  Then we thought it must be a rocket launch or a piece of gigantic space debris burning up slowly.  A helicopter on fire?  But there was absolutely no sound.  While it was in the sky, an actual plane with normal red blinking lights passed by it and gave us perspective on how much larger this fire ball was or how much farther away it was from us.  Unfortunately, we were all so stupefied none of us thought to whip out a cell phone and try to record. As it enlarged (or came closer to us on an easterly course) we got the strange feeling our large pit fire was somehow visible to the craft (IF it was a craft!) and maybe was attracting it's attention?  I hate to be unscientific but since we all felt that way afterwards, it's worth noting.  After about 3 minutes it slowly just ""winked out"" and disappeared.  Very reminiscent of the second stage of a rocket reaching orbital height. Interestingly, there WAS a planned launch of a Space X satellite scheduled for 6:20 that evening from Cape Canaveral, but the launch was aborted, so that wasn't it. We were also aware of comet ISON approaching perihelion that afternoon -- but there was no way that was it.   One final observation: we can clearly see a local New Paltz landmark, the little light in the tower at Mohonk Mountain House way up on a mountain from that location.  We can see that light with the naked eye, and since my friends have hiked up there many times they know that light is made by two little 75 watt bulbs.  After discussing this, we all agree what we saw for that brief time was 1,000 times brighter than that little light at Mohonk. Thanks so much for your interest. Please keep me posted on any developments or ideas you have on what we saw--what we all might be seeing--in these ""fireball"" type sightings.

The sun had gone down, but it there was still some daylight left.  It was mostly overcast.  I was in the driveway seeing off my partner's uncle.  I was watching them put their stuff in his car.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw what I initially thought was a piece of paper/cardboard ash in the floating in the air above me to the south.  I immediately wondered who would be having a fire?  I had just been in the back yard with my guests and we didn't hear anyone outside in their yards or smell any type of fire.  It's also against the town ordinance to have fires in your back yard around here. Anyway, I kept watching it, wondering what it was.  When I first saw it, I swear it was flat.  It was the color of burning embers.  It was heading upwards toward in a Northeast direction, but heading more upward if that makes any sense.  As it ascended, it looked different.  It looked more like orange lights rather than burning embers.  It was a weird light, almost had a metallic glean to it.  I've never seen anything like it and it's kind of hard to describe.  It didn't seem to look as flat.  I called out to my partner's brother to look at it. He looked up and said ""it's probably one of those Chinese lanterns"".  My partner's mother was also watching it at the time from my vantage point.  It didn't look like any type of lantern to us.   My partner's mother thought it looked like a plane having a hard time.  But it seemed too close and it made absolutely no noise.  By this time, my partner had come outside.  She tried to start video taping it with her phone, but by t! his time it was pretty high up in the sky.  It continued ascending and disappeared into the clouds before she could get her phone camera going.  This all happened in the course of about 2 minutes at most so I assume it must have been going pretty fast.

Working night-shift during the Maine blueberry harvest this year, I, along with several others witnessed strange craft in the sky.  The first sighting occurred early in the month of August in the town of Centerville.  It was probably about 11pm.  I had parked my car about 100 yards away from where our harvesters were and was walking back to grab my sweatshirt.  It was a clear night and something in the sky caught my eye as I got further away from the bright lights on the tractors.  It was a bright orange light (brighter than any star in the sky), and it sat lower on the horizon than anything else.  I figured it must be a planet or something, maybe Mars.   After I got to my car I stood and watched it for a moment.  Occasionally, it would appear as if it was blinking or rotating, flashing different colors: orange, red, and blue.  It started making choppy movements, a little to the right and then back, a little up, and then back. I thought I was just seeing things so I ! headed back into the field, got in my forklift and went to pick up blueberry totes. About an hour later, I looked back in the spot where the light was (North west of the field we were working in, almost in the direction of the old Over the Horizon Back Scatter Radar site, which was 8 miles away. The next night, the light showed up in the same exact spot it had originally been the night before, at around 9pm. It remained still.  After one of the harvesters broke down, a few of us were standing around talking when I looked up and saw the light slowly moving east across the sky.  I said to my boss and co-worker, ""You see that light up there?  That's no aircraft that I know of."" I told them about the night before.  They didn't seem to take it very seriously, but they couldn't explain what it was either.  That night I texted one of my buddies who was irrigating in Township 25.  I told him what happened and asked him if he had seen the light.  He hadn't, but said he would keep his eyes open.  I had no idea how close or far away the craft was.  I saw it several other nights in Centerville, but it would soon fly below the treeline, out of sight. A couple nights later we were at a field in Harrington. That night I watched it fly right overhead, towards where I had first seen it in Centerville.  The next time I remember seeing it, we were on the barrens in Columbia.  From the field we were harvesting, the windmills on Bull Hill, 15 miles to the northwest, were easily visible.  My buddy who I had told about the light, was now irrigating in the fields right next to us.  While I was on the back end of a field picking up totes one night, he texted me and said that there's a weird light over by the windmills and that it might be the one I was telling him about.  Sure enough, when I got back to where his four-wheeler was, I could see that same light through the tops of the trees.  It would move one way real slow, then suddenly shoot back in the other direction.  Then it would shoot upwards, then back down. eventually it got below the treeline where we could no longer see it.  No aircraft that I have ever known of can maneuver i! n the manner that this craft was.  The night after that my buddy texted me around midnight and said, ""Light's back.""  It was higher up in the sky this time and was moving the same way.  When it seemed to get close to the windmills, it started doing something I hadn't seen it do before.  The orange light faded out, then completely shut off, and was replaced by a dim red light that was blinking in unison with the windmills.  My buddy and I watched the light in roughly the same spot for about a week.  His girlfriend was there and saw it one night too. On the 26th of August, around 9:30pm, we saw it over by the windmills again, but this time there seemed to be a second one with it, a little further away.  After about a month of seeing this one light almost every night, it was really weird to see a second one with it. We watched them both fade out and disappear.  A few hours later, around 11pm, my employer and co-worker had left to find the other field that we were moving to.  There was nothing else to do, so my buddy and I sat in my truck, listened to the radio, and warmed up until they got back.  Around 1:30am I saw the light to the west, at a fairly high altitude. Pretty soon the other two guys got back.  They pulled up beside me and I told them that we were watching the UFO light.  My employer (who was one of the guys who I had showed the light to in Centerville) said, ""I gotta see this.""  He turned his headlights off, and I showed him where the light was. It was kind of a cloudy night, but there were a lot of b! reaks in the clouds where we could watch the light.  Pretty soon, we notice there are more. Four or five more. All the same exact kind of light: bright, solid orange, but occasionally seeming to rotate and flash red, blue, and orange.  They didn't seem to be flying in any sort of formation, they were just allover the place.  Sometimes they would hover for a while, and then begin making really bizarre movements.  They would fade out, completely disappear, and then reappear.  We watched one of them slowly move right overhead of us, and then shoot back really fast in the direction from which it came.  We were the only four people for miles around at this time.  The blueberry harvest is over now, and I haven't seen the light since, but when we get another clear night I will definitely look for it.  Seeing this light/lights is probably the strangest thing I've ever experienced.  The really weird part is that I saw it so much this past month, that it became a normal occurrence to me.   Nonetheless, it is extremely bizarre, and I would really like to! know wh at those craft were. I am in the Air National Guard, 101st ARW Bangor, Maine, as well is my father who is a Senior Master Sergeant and the Wing First Sergeant.  He is also a Maine Game Warden.  My employer owns a farm right around here, and his father is a retired police officer.  My other co-worker who witnessed the lights is in the Army National Guard, and my buddy that was irrigating plans on joining the Marines.  None of us have the slightest idea of what these lights could have been.  P.S.  We attempted to get the light on video several times, but it would not show up on our phone cameras.",2013-09-09T00:00:00,,

On May 24, 2013, at approximately 9:15 pm, I was on W. Hill Rd in Flint MI. I was facing a more or less Westerly direction and looked up.  Over my right shoulder, travelling from East to West was a flying object trailing a long tail of fire. As I watched, I removed my cell phone and recorded video footage of the event. The object proceeded in a Westerly direction until it vanished into a bank of clouds.  I kept recording, anticipating the object’s re-emergence from the cloud bank, but saw no further sign of the object.  It was much larger and more vivid in the sky than any aircraft I have previously encountered.  It burned very brightly and intensely, reminding me of nothing more than a launched rocket as it may appear shortly after lift-off, while still travelling through Earth’s atmosphere.  It was that appearance which caused me to make the reports and requests for information I made.  Being a Cold war Veteran, I could not help but equate what I saw with a possible missile launch. Being concerned for the safety of persons, I called Bishop International Airport, MI Air National Guard, MUFON, as well as local news agencies who I asked if they had received reports of this event-all replied that they had NOT received similar reports from other persons. Several suggested that I report the sighting to police, which I did NOT do. Whether Terrestrial or Extra terrestrial, there was no crime which I observed being committed or anything which I would perceive as falling under “Police Jurisdiction”. The Officer I spoke with from Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center spoke to his Base Commander, who had previously served at Wright Patterson AFB in Ohio, and the Commander stated that the USAF does not “officially recognize UFOs” and cannot, therefore, take reports concerning the sighting thereof.  He recommended I contact the National UFO Reporting Service and provided me with the number and website information to do so.  I am now doing so. Feel free to contact me if you have questions or information concerning this Atmospheric Event. I do have video footage which should be reviewed by an analyst.",2013-06-02T00:00:00,43.014164735516374,-83.70674685138538

Its location, seemingly, would have put it over the Atlantic Ocean with the towns of Narragansett and N. Kingston to its left.  It was moving the speed of a slow plane, but absent any blinking lights. It almost appeared to be a plane on fire.  No trail, however, was evident as such an event might generate. I watched it go directly overhead on a NE trajectory toward Portsmouth, RI. And it was soundless.  A meteor?  Too slow.  An unmanned flame-driven hot air balloon of some kind? Too fast and steady in its trajectory.  There was little wind.  And its consistent horizontal path did not suggest a flare of any kind. Moments later, a second object, similar in size, appeared following the same trajectory.  As I watched both recede toward the NE horizon, I called my wife to come outside to see if she could get a glimpse before they disappeared. Then a third object appeared on the SW horizon, followed, yet again, by a fourth.  She could see what had caught my attention.  They passed directly overhead, spaced in much the same fashion as the previous two, about fifteen seconds apart (as they emerged over the horizon).  And each took about seventy seconds to pass from horizon point to horizon point.  And as the others, they were round in shape.  The light emanating from all was flame-like white orange...again, with no sound at all.  All four moved at a speed and trajectory that did not suggest floating objects.  My inability to ascertain the light source made altitude difficult to assess.  My best guess: four to eight thousand feet, because one could see a somewhat pronounced, not perfectly symmetrical flame-like flickering, but very bright.

I was driving down a dirt road in the country when I saw a medium green light suddenly appear approx 20 feet off the ground.  The light was an orb about 1 ft by 1 ft. the orb descended at a rapid pace and then disappeared.  A few seconds later I saw a flash of green light (lighter in color than the first light from the orb).  Directly after the flash, I noticed a white/gray light flashing and changing positions on some cows where it had landed.  The white/gray light had a solid beam from the source of it and when I could see it on the body of the cows it was making a line pattern.  At this time I was approx 50 yards away from the object and I could see that the flashing light was on top or a part of a square object that was floating 2 to 3 ft off the ground.  The object itself was probably 4 ft in length and 2 ft in width.  It appeared to be made of metal and was a smoky gray color.  The light coming from the object was certainly artificial but there was something v! ery unsettling about them.  My entire observation lasted approx 5 minutes.  When I saw it was floating, I turned the vehicle around and drove in the other direction down the same road I came from and drove for 2 miles.  I was very shaken because I had no logical explanation for what I had seen.  I am a truck driver that works in the oilfield so I had no choice but to return and resume my work about 20 minutes later.  I got back to the location of the sighting around 8:15 pm and it and the cows (approx 10) were gone.  I finished my work and left without seeing it again.  It is also worth noting that while I was observing it and fleeing from it, that it didn't seem to notice me or the semi truck I was driving.  While I was fleeing, I had a feeling of dread that if the object noticed me that it would not be good.   This sighting is the most exciting and scariest event of my life.  I don't have pics/video of the object because I fled when I got a good look at it.  I returned to the location regularly and will try to get at least a picture of it, so long as I have the courage to do so.",2013-11-20T00:00:00,,

At approximately 18:00 hrs I received a phone call from a friend and neighbor of mine, asking me if I had a telescope.  I asked why and he replied that he was observing a UFO.  I told him I didn't have a telescope but I did have a high powered rifle scope.  He said he had been home a short while from work but his family had been observing this UFO since noon.  I told him I would grab my rifle scope and take a look and call him back.  I then proceeded to the front deck of my home to investigate.  I located the sphere with my naked eye, then located it in my rifle scope.  Upon focused and magnified acquisition of the object it was clear to me that I was observing something completely out of this world.  The next 15 minutes was very intense!  I needed to find a way to photograph this object. My first problem was holding the scope steady enough so I could show my wife.  I brain stormed briefly,and remembered I had a laser level kit in the garage that contained a tripod.  While acquiring the tripod I also grabbed some automotive grade masking tape to afix the scope to the tripod.  After successfully affixing the rifle scope to the tripod I needed to elevate the front of the scope to approximately 75 degrees angle of elevation.  I then grabbed a small end table from inside the house and elevated two of the legs on the tripod. This work yielded a steady picture in the scope suitable for viewing.  The following steps included showing my wife and calling my neighbor back and telling him to come over to see this thing magnified.  My neighbor showed up promptly and took a look.  He then informed my wife and I that he had called relatives 450 miles away to the west and they too were observing this same sphere.  I thought to myself, I have to try and photograph this object under magnification of this rifle scope.  I figured if I could see this object clearly by positioning myself to the proper eye relief of the scope maybe I could get my iPhone to auto focu! s at the same position and yield a quality photo.  This was no ! easy tas k but I pushed on and got the job done.  After taking many pics, I had at least 3 in focus photos of the sphere.  My best verbal description of the object is simple, it looked like a perfect pearl with the light of the sun reflecting on the left side of it.  The accompanying photos should speek for themselves.  The position of the object was eleven o clock, north being the 12 o' clock position. The elevation angle was approximately 75 degrees. ((NUFORC Note:  The object looks to us to be a lens flare, caused by reflection in the rifle scope.  However, the witness assures us that he saw the object with his naked eye.  We are awaiting other reports, in particular, the report from the people who were located 450 miles from the first witness.  PD))",2013-09-30T00:00:00,42.4555,-96.4535

A bright light in the SW sky appeared to be in the direction of Channahon Illinois from the point where my house is in Mokena.  I watched it for 15 minutes as I sat by my front door.  It appeared to be moving somewhat towards my direction but very slow which I thought was an incoming airplane to Midway Airport.   After 4 to 5 minutes of watching the object it appeared to stop.  I focused my eye with a rooftop edge as I sat on my front door stoop to help me judge if it was moving or not and from my judgment it was not.  Approximately another 4 minutes went by and the object appeared to drift very slowly to the right dimming on occasion.  At one point it dimmed to nothing but within 15 seconds or so it came back in the exact position it disappeared. I’m pretty familiar with the flight patterns of airplanes over my home, this wasn’t on any normal path to Midway and why it caught my attention other than being very bright. At this point I ran inside my house for my digital camera returned and snapped 4 photos.  Like any other photo ever taken of objects at night they usually come out dark but the light was very visible along with outlines of the rooftops.  I lightened them up as much as I could and blew –up a few photos also. When first observed it appeared to look like a very bright star in the SW sky at about 30 degrees above the horizon.  The exact size is unclear from my observation point but as indicated it looked like a bright star.  It changed from an oval dot to an un-described shape, perhaps in a cylinder form.  If one was to look at a piece of rice three feet in front of them that is the shape it would turn into.  Its brightness would dim and then become bright with a hint of a red glow now and then. The last few minutes it stayed bright and settled below the rooftops to where I could no longer observe it.

I turned my head to the north and was looking at a couple of constellations when all of a sudden I saw a large, dark grey object come over the house at a fast rate of speed. It was heading from the north, going south, and there was absolutely NO SOUND heard.  I immediately pointed and alerted my father. He managed to see it in time before it went past and was lost from view.  We got up to see if we could still track where it was going, but it was gone within seconds.  The object was a long cigar shape and the size was large. I figured that it was approximately 250 FT in length, but the odd thing was that it was traveling horizontally. No known plane (as far as the American public has been allowed to have knowledge of) can travel at the speed this object did. It had dim, solid circular-shaped lights, almost like the off-white color of the dim stars in the sky. The position of the lights was the most noticeable. There were two on the starboard side and one on the port side.  The color was a real dark grey, but it was enough to be noticed in the dark of the night sky. The object emitted no sound at all. To further solidify this unexplainable sighting, a prop-engine plane coming from the southeast passed over the area at 21:55 PM, approximately 10 minutes after the object was first observed. I could hear the engines and see the distinct placement of the aircraft’s lights.  Conditions were clear. There was no moon out and no wind was present.

On Wednesday, 6 November 2013 about 2005 in the evening, I went out to my back yard in San Angelo, TX, and was admiring the clear night sky with a crescent moon and lots of stars.  The moon was lower in the horizon, and I looked straight up to look at the stars. As I was looking up, the light of one of those “stars” appeared to just “turn off.”  There was no movement at all involved with this “star,” and it appeared very distant in space like the other stars.   I thought that was strange, and I kept looking up to see if the light would “turn back on.” Well, the light did “turn back on” about 10 seconds later, only  I would guess about 20 degrees due south/southeast from where I first saw it.  The light was back on only for about 5 seconds, then it was off again.   I kept looking if I would see it again along the same trajectory, but I never saw it again.  Between these two sightings, there was no visible path, no blinking lights, no movement, etc. What was so unusual about this sighting was that there was no motion involved when I saw the “star” those two times, and it appeared as distant as the other stars in the sky with similar light intensity and character.  In both instances, the light “just turned off,” and there was no visible path whatsoever. I have admired the nighttime sky for many, many years and am familiar with what airplanes, satellites, the space station, the shuttle, etc. all look like when I look up, this is nothing like I have ever seen before.",2013-11-11T00:00:00,31.398490410958907,-100.45207260273972

It was about 19:20 in the evening, a few moments before sunset - the sky was still light.  I was doing my rounds and I happened to look up at the sky when I first saw it. Looking towards the west, I noticed a small black object high in the sky.  It was moving towards the east in a straight line and what appeared to be a constant speed.  I first thought it might be a bird, but as it got nearer I noticed it had no wings.  Its shape also became more apparent as it approached.  It had the appearance of a diamond lying on its side.  The back half was black, but the front half was white and the latter appeared to be spinning on its axis.   could see its shape quite clearly since it was not to high up - below cloud level, and it passed right above me.  It was absolutely silent. After about two minutes it disappeared towards the east - still travelling at a constant speed and in a straight line. Since I work near Israel's only meteorological station, I'm familiar with their weather balloons which I can see being launched.  I often track them as the rise up, and under certain conditions - like sunset, they can have the appearance of a flying saucer.  I also work near our country's only international airport, and low-flying aircraft on takeoffs and landings are a familiar sight to me.  What I saw was not a aircraft, helicopter, balloon or kite.  I cannot explain what I saw and this fact has been bugging me ever since.  What kind of diamond-shaped object can fly - let alone make no sound?  I constantly see the object in my minds eye and I'm stumped as to what it was. I took 3 pictures with my cellphone camera, but the camera was low quality and all you can see is a small black dot with a white tinge to it.  My celllphone doesn't connect to a computer, so I sent it to a friend via SMS who will transfer it to a computer and then email back to me so that I can enlarge it a bit.  I was the only witness, but the object came from the Tel Aviv area so others may have seen it - so far nothing has appeared in the local press/media.I will email the pictures as soon as soon as I can. I should mention that the object was about the size of a car and appeared to be on a preprogrammed flight path.  I considered the possibility of a drone of some unusual shape - but why would someone fly a experimental drone over a populated area and near an airport with low-flying planes?  What if it crashed or fell to the ground?  My friends thought I had imagined it, and people smiled at me when I told them what I saw.   I know what I saw and I'm not embarrassed to tell people.

I was so excited that I realized I was truly mistaken, what appeared to be a cloud was in fact the milky way.  It was completely clear out.

I don't know what it was but at the very least maybe an angel.  I know my area and It WAS NOT a plane or natural phenomena.  I hope the truth on these things come out soon because I stand corrected and am now a believer.

I noticed a green light in the sky as i sat and ate.   so i got up to see what it was.  that's when i really started to see that it was very bright light moving back and forth in the sky, very unlike an airplane or a helicopter.   So i called it to the attention of everyone. there were about 10 witnesses to the event. Everyone saw this thing glowing bright in the night sky. and it appeared to have a smaller reddish purple craft following it around. smaller.. or maybe not as bright.  it made hard turns in the sky and would disappear without warning and re-appear the same way.  At one point it dropped suddenly out of the sky as if it would a molten flame.  it disappeared below the tree line in the distance, only to reappear again in the sky.  truly an amazing site!   To get a better look i got out my binoculars.  This is when i realized it was something special.  Through the binoculars i could see it was an oval craft lined with what looked like 6-8 green light around the perimeter of the object.  and this is when i could see it turning and banking like a ship in the ocean.  making turns and even turning in a way that appeared to be upside down. The purple craft was also the same shape.  But smaller in size.  And its had one red light on one of its sides.  it moved with the red light behind it, as if it were the back of the craft moving forward.  i (we) also saw this craft turning, banking fast and flipping over or.. doing upside down turns.  we all took cell phone videos. they came out OK.. not great, but you can see a green dot in the sky.  We continued to watch until they were gone for good.  we stayed outside for another 2 hours and nothing returned.  This not the first time ive seen stuff in the Covina area.  it seems to be a hot bed of activity over the last 10 years. Looking through the binoculars was the best way to view it.  I find it hard to believe the whole town didn't see this event.  Many of the witnesses this night we non-believers and never seen anything before.

This event started at approximately 11:35 p.m. on June 28th.  My wife and I were lying in bed listening to Coast to Coast, with our drapes open on the large bedroom window that faces north waiting to see if we would be able to discern any aurora’s since there were some forecast from the web site she monitors.  One of our cats that is both epileptic and deaf was fussing at the foot of our bed.   She got up to put him on the foot of the bed, and as she came around her side of the bed she was looking out the window and described a very bright orange light coming from the north. I rolled over on the bed to see as well, and sure enough, it looked to me to be an orange fireball type of object drifting slowly our way from the north no more than approximately 700 to 1,000 feet above our small town, so approximately 45 degrees from where we were since it was so close.  We both watched for a few minutes as it drifted toward our position. The screen made it look distorted so I grabbed my robe and went outside. We keep my wife’s bird watching binoculars on a peg in our firewood awning for weird things like this, and as I grabbed them the object turned 90 degrees and started moving west.  As I looked at it through the binoculars, it looked to me like a bright orange spherical object emitting an orange misty halo around itself, which gave the illusion that the misty halo was trailing it almost like you would see with a cometary object.   I pulled the binoculars from my eyes as it neared the ridge from my perspective of the small mountain to our west, and I was amazed to see it start to descend and dim as it entered into the trees on the side of the mountain!  I called to my wife to make sure I wasn’t seeing things, and she confirmed from the bedroom window that it had indeed descended into the trees up there!    She came outside then and we pulled up some lawn chairs to wait for it to reappear, but it never did, and there was no way I was going to drive out there to see if anything was there! Besides, it went into the forest maybe a quarter mile up the side of the mountain from where the road would be.  We waited for about 45 minutes, and then decided to go back in and go to sleep. It’s the weirdest thing we’ve both witnessed to date, but I did report an orange fireball the 4th of July to NUFORC that everyone at our BBQ witnessed about 3 years ago. The object was visible and moving slowly in plain view for roughly ten minutes until it faded into the forest. My wife wants to construct a floating lantern to experiment to see if it could have possibly been something like that, but it moved under its own power as there were no discernible winds that night and was extremely bright.

Its size slowly decreased in size as if it was traveling away to the ENE then disappeared.  As the light vanished a new burnt orange light appeared in the SSE sky.  I took notice of the location as being in the area of a particular star in the sky.  When the second object/light appeared it was bright with a haze around it and took the exact same track at a 35-degree angle moving at a steady rate of speed from right to left in my field of view.  It also appeared to decrease in size as if it was traveling away to the ENE then it to disappeared.  I noted the location of the object/light disappearance by a star in the vicinity.  Again, as the second object/light vanished a third appeared in the exact same spot as the second object/light appeared as if I was watching a recording of the event.  This time I took out my camera phone and videoed the event.  The track was identical, the orientation identical, the color, shape, haze around the object identical, and it disappeared in the identical spot as the previous two objects.

Peter Davenport: I just saw the strangest of the three or four UFOs I have seen.  At about 6:57 PDT, I saw two blinking lights zooming around.  It started with one very small and bright, blue-white light heading east, which appeared to be a satellite. I was about fifteen miles north of Spokane, WA and looking to the south.  A second one appeared slightly to the east of the first and heading west, toward the other one.  They were blinking randomly about one second each two to four seconds.  At this time I thought I was watching something taking place a thousand feet above I-90, in Spokane Valley.  They might have been a few miles north of Mica Peak. As the two small, intense, blinking lights interacted for thirty seconds or so, they changed speed and direction.  Because the lights were off more than they were on, it was hard to tell which one was which as they cirlcled.  Sometimes they may have been moving at about the speed of airplanes and sometimes much faster than any airplane.  I blinked my eyes and asked myself if I was really seeing it in the physical realm and the answer was yes.   After twenty or thirty seconds, they separated and disappeared when they were about a mile apart, providing they were actually above I-90.  --  I can't rule out some sort of Laser light show, but it sure looked like an interdimensional light show to me.       -- Sincerely, J S",2013-10-23T00:00:00,47.68357629392971,-117.38633105431309

It was at 1:53 a.m. and I woke up from a sound sleep to a noise coming from outside my window in the courtyard area (which is the front of my house). It was the same area and direction where my adult relative heard a noise one week earlier. The sound that woke me from sleep was a loud noise giving off electrical feedback, like from an amplifier, or like a microphone being put close to a large wattage speaker, creating a high pitch sound or frequency. I also heard what sounded like a muffled, soft, metallic voice speaking over or through the noise, like it was giving some kind of verbal directions or orders. I could not make out what the voice was saying, but it sounded like English. The direction of the noise definitely was in the courtyard, but seemed directed from above and down across to the house. I had been awake for about thirty seconds and continued hearing this. I was really tired and ready to get up to go look out the window, but as I was ready to do so, the noise and voice faded to silence. Again, no lights or craft were seen or witnessed.  The next morning, I asked my adult relative who heard a noise one week prior (first report) if she heard this and this time she did not. It was then that we both, and another relative, started to discuss these strange noises and some other ones throughout the last couple of years. I also studied the courtyard and one half side of it has five tall birch trees (20 ft. in height) and the other side of the courtyard (where our front yard is and where our bedroom windows face) there are four red maple trees (6 ft. in height). Among these maple trees, two had unexpectedly died a few summers ago, I would say in 2010. Two new maples were planted, and they, and the other original three all started to change their leaves for the Fall season that June and July, way ahead of schedule, and the leaves turned black (or scorched) and fell off by the end of August of that year. Not sure why. Then as of this last year, the two newly planted maples died and had to be replaced again. Before the! y died, their leaves also change ahead of time and turned black as well. These two spots where these maples are located are right outside and below our windows about 12 and 20 feet away. So far, the new trees appear to be doing better than the others.  Also, as we were discussing this, a relative reminded me about a dream I shared a few summers ago, sometime in either 2010 or 2011. I had totally forgotten about this… but I had woken up one summer morning feeling very disturbed by a dream I had (at least I hope it was a dream as it seemed so real). The dream was short in duration, but in the dream, I was lying down and looking up at two alien beings staring down at me. I was being examined by them, and the portion of that dream felt like it was the end of the dream or after the examination. For some reason, that is the only part of the dream I remember and then I woke up scared because it all felt too real. I really can’t describe it any other way. This dream was around the time when I first started hearing strange computer-like ""beeping noises"" in the early pre-dawn hours during the summer when I had my window open on various nights.  I’m an adult male who is a devout, non-denominational Christian. I’m not sure what all these things mean, but it’s clear we might be (and have been) witnessing some strange encounters unbeknownst to us all this time. Again, we would like to remain anonymous, but continue to be vigilant of our nighttime surroundings. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At the time of the sighting, it was located almost directly over the mid section of the Catalina Mountains north of Tucson. The light did not have the characteristics of a 'beam' with a ray emanating forward, but rather that of a glowing effect that was constant in luminescence.  Estimating height would put it at several miles up however there was insufficient evidence to make more than a guess. It moved very slowly relative to what one might see from an airliner or even that of a small plane.  There were no strobe lights seen during this sighting and no other color was present than the dull white glow.  No sound could be heard either. As we watched its flight path, it moved towards, and eventually into, a small cloud. Fully expecting to see it emerge on the other side of this small cloud I was surprised to see nothing emerge. When the cloud moved on, there was no light anywhere in the area. A short time later, we again witnessed what appeared to be another light in the same general area and same characteristics as the first only moving somewhat perpendicular to that of the first object's path. This time there was no cloud in the object's path but after a couple of minutes, it just faded to nothing. Both objects seemed to travel about the same distance in their respective directions before disappearing.  Both were larger relative to the 'moving spot' one sees when a satellite passes overhead.

We had been talking about how much air traffic there is in this part of the San Fernando Valley just a few minutes before heading outside. We stopped for a moment to watch the plane in its traffic pattern, and then my mother pointed out a point of bright white light, definitely higher than 40 thousand feet and moving at a very high rate of speed.  It was faster than a commercial or private jet, and not as high as a satellite in orbit.  The three of us all had our eyes fixed on it as it moved south/southwest in the dark night sky.  Suddenly, its rate of speed dramatically increased, and then it spectacularly appeared to ascend its altitude, upward, until it became invisible to the naked eye.  There was no sound from the object. There were very few stars visible.  The night sky over Sherman Oaks and Los Angeles is extremely polluted with light as you very well know.  Aircraft is easily visible, satellites can be made out with a trained eye…but this white light was so bright and clearly visible…it was an amazing sight. We all three stood there dumbfounded for a few seconds, and then I finally asked them ""did ya'll see that?""  They both said nodded yes.  We were all in agreement that whatever we saw, it was unlike anything we'd ever seen in our lives.  We talked about it for the rest of the evening.

It made absolutely no sound.  No prop noise-no jet noise. I’ve never seen aircraft flying at night that had an orange-red light on the front which made me stop and look at it.  I also thought it was very odd in that private planes/commercial jets always have flashing lights on their wings/fuselage and this had none, just an orange-red “headlight”.  I call it a “headlight” because as it passed directly overhead, the orange-red light faded and disappeared.  I’m guessing the light pointed forward which is why I was no longer able to see it once it was traveling away from me. After it disappeared, I looked back from where I first saw it and there was ANOTHER, identical, very bright, orange-red light traveling in the same direction at the same speed-no sound.  I watched it and again, the orange light faded and disappeared once it was directly overhead. After rubber-necking, I looked back again where I had first seen the first two and now there were THREE MORE!  They were all visible at the same time.  They were obviously traveling in a line, following one another.  The first two must have been spaced farther apart and the  last 3 must have been following one another more closely which is why I could see all three of them at once.  I live at the base of a hill with trees on top so I don’t have a good view of the horizon so I could not see all five of them approaching at the same time. The last three did the same thing-fade and disappear once they were directly overhead, one after another.  I could see no wings or profile of the crafts, nor could I hear them.  It was a clear night with stars visible.  No city lights and dead quiet.  I live in the boonies. I’m pretty sure they were very low-maybe 3000-6000 feet.  If they were higher, I would have seen them all at once and they would not have “crept” past the treeline. I’ve seen military planes/copters traveling in convoys before-they make a racket.  These things made no sound at all. After looking at the Mufon posts, I see that others in Wisconsin have seen the exact same red-orange things flying the exact same way.  What the heck are they?

I sent my husband a text to tell him that I was outside and to send the kids out to the parking lot.  I had pulled in front of the building.  My daughter came out carrying my son. I was watching them out the window of the passenger side door.   When I noticed my son didn't have a hat on I looked forward toward the dash of the truck to check the thermometer for the outside temp.  In my peripheral vision I saw what I thought was a shooting star.  I locked my sight on it.  It didn't burn out as expected. I actually got bigger as it got closer.  When the object was directly in front of my field of Vision I could see that it was the size of the biggest full moon you have ever seen.  Like the harvest moon.  The color was blue. In the center it was darker blue then lighter blue then white on the parameter if the object.  A trail or tail followed the object.  It filled the horizon.  It travelled diagonal in front of me and disappeared under the tree line.  I heard no noise or felt nothing.   My daughter was buckling my son in his carseat and there was no one else in the parking lot to share it with.

This was a close repeat of what I witnessed last night.  Because it was so similar to the previous night, I ended up with 2 pages of notes, versus the few paragraphs I usually jot down after a sighting.  It was partly cloudy, but there were stars out in places.  I could lights on in my “cornerstone” 3-story house on North Captiva, 8 miles away, but the lights were a bit hazy. At 8:55 p.m. I arrived at the beach where I regularly skywatch, just north of the rock jetty at Blind Pass, on the south end of Captiva Island, Florida.  There was still a bit of light in the sky.  At 9:05 p.m. I saw an object with naked eyes that was as bright and as big around as Venus, approximately 60 degrees above the horizon above the Gulf of Mexico, traveling about as fast as a satellite, NW to SSE, but at an altitude of about 10,000 feet at the most.  I watched it through my binoculars for a little more than a minute and saw that it had very sharply defined edges and was indeed a sphere.  It was by far much larger than any of the numerous satellites I have seen.  It had a luminous, off-white exterior.  The sun may have been reflecting off of it, but I’m not sure, other than it was not a plane or satellite.  It went into a cloud as it went south and that was all I saw of it.  At 9:12 I saw with my naked eye a bright orange “fireball”, about the size of a grape at arm’s length, just seaward and above southern Cayo Costa Island (see Map), at an altitude of around 2,000 feet.  I watched it through my 10X42 binoculars for 10 minutes as it dimmed down in brightness and changed colors to an orange-white, and then mostly a dull white, while it drifted out to sea 2 to 3 miles, and downward to approximately 1,000 feet or less, where it dimmed out.  Shortly after the fireball went out I started seeing in the same area little pinpoint flashes of white light (one form of “flashers”), maybe 500 feet above the water. A good description I just thought of was that they were like perhaps like flashbulbs going off at great distance.  There were 4 or 5 of them in a fairly small area, strobing irregularly, on for a split second and then off for a full second, sometimes flashing quickly numerous times,  just like last night.  Then 2 of them came together, one above the other, one right on the water, and the other 200 to 300 feet directly above it.  They were lined up vertically and perfectly. I didn’t see what happened to the others because I was focusing on the two, which quickly stopped strobing and became steady, dim white lights, barely visible through my binoculars.  After a brief while they both slowly started getting brighter, stayed bright enough to see with the naked eye, and just hovered in place for about 5 minutes.  Af! ter this time the one on the water became very dim quickly, as if going into the water, and then disappeared.  Within a few seconds the light above dimmed out.  I could still see occasional dim pinpoints flashbulbs of white light in the area for a while.  At 9:45 two bright, deep amber, oval lights came on in the same area but closer to shore.  When I looked at them through my binocs I could see that they were “stacked,” one directly above the other, EXACTLY LIKE THE SILVER-GOLD UFOs I’D SEEN ON PREVOIUS NIGHTS!!  I actually got rather frightened, because I was alone on the beach, an it was really dark.  Except for the fact that they were amber colored, they behaved just like the ones last night with distant “flash bulbs” going off in the vicinity.  I watched these objects for a solid 10 minutes.  One was right on or very near the water and the one above it was again, 3 or so object widths above it, no more than 200 feet above the water.  They went on and off 7 or 8 times.  Right before they went out there was one fairly bright “flashbulb” that went off just to the left (seaward) of them.  During the time they were dimming on and off, the one on the bottom would just get real dim and looked like a little blob on top of the wa! ter.  I thought at the time that it was dipping in and out of the water because of the way it was acting.  I also thought at the time that they were pulsating very, very slowly.  The one on the bottom went out after about 5 minutes, and it took the one on the top another 5 minutes before it went out, slowly getting dimmer and dimmer.  At 9:56 I was walking north on the beach to talk to a fisherman up there and asked him if he saw what I was seeing.  He said no, that he was mostly looking straight out on the Gulf, instead of 90 degrees to the right.  Then the two elongated amber lights came back on and we both looked at them for 2 or 3 minutes before they went out.  They looked through binoculars exactly like the ones I’d just seen, and they were in the same spot.  Again, the one on the bottom went out first, and then within 20 seconds or so the one on the top went out.  I did not see any “sparkles” or “flashbulbs” in the area this time.  Shortly after this last event I went back home to write up my notes.  These observations know lead me to believe that these elongated/oval deep amber objects, which were of the exact kind and quality of amber light as amber/orange “fireballs,” may have been the same as the elongated dull silver-goldish craft I’d previously seen, just a different color phase.

Cayo Costa runs north and south and is 6.5 miles long, and just offshore there and North Captiva is where I have been seeing MUCH activity lately.  It’s south end is right on the outside edge of the horizon, to the NNW of where I normally skywatch.  House and other lights are easily visible to the naked eye on North Captiva from my vantage point, with my eye level being about 12 feet above sea level.  There is a 3-story house on the Gulf! beach, on stilts on North Captiva, in which you can see lights in windows on each floor with binoculars at night; I estimate that the roof top is about 60 feet above sea level.  I use it for estimating the size, distance and height of objects I see in the area. I brought the light into focus with my 10X42 binoculars and saw that it was a spherical light, versus a definable object like the elongated football shaped UFOs I previously saw.  I would estimate that it was around 100 feet in diameter, which is about the same length of the clearly defined football shaped UFO’s I’ve previously reported on (Sightings # 22 to #26).  It hovered around 150 feet  above the Gulf’s horizon for about 5 minutes, quickly rose to about 1,000 feet, hovered there for a short while, brightened up and then faded away within 30 to 40 seconds.  At 9:15 I saw through my binocs one of the “single strobe flashers” I’ve reported on before.  It looked like it was over the right side of N. Captiva, about 400 to 500 feet above the island, maybe a quarter mile to the right of tallest house there on the beach, and around 9 miles distant.  These points of light would show up in 1 to 3 second intervals, which made it easy to follow.  Every once in a while there would be a bright flash, must mostly it stayed about the same.  I watched it drift about 2 to 3 miles over, or just beyond, the island and go out to sea as it slowly dropped in altitude.  When it got about 2 miles off shore it drifted right near the water’s surface and then went out. Right after the strobe went out, and while I was still looking through my binoculars and started making a sweep along the horizon, I saw just to the left of where the other light went out, THE SAME “DOUBLE UFOs” I’d seen and reported on not more than a week ago!!!  These were right on the horizon, one just a tad above the water, and the second right above it by 3 craft widths.  These objects seemed more hazy (probably because there was a strong breeze), but still the same dull silver and goldish/yellow color.  They were around 100 feet long, and a little less than half the height.  The craft did not merge as they had before, at least that I saw while they were visible.  They did change brightness though, independently but not regularly, with one getting really bright, and then the other, and so on.  They would only be visible to the naked eye in their bright phase.  I got a really good look at them and watched them for a good 3 minutes before they disappeared, with first the! one on the bottom going out, and then the one on top going out.  I really hate to say this, and should have said it in my first report on these objects, but the fact is that they were typical “flying saucer” shape.  I don’t even use that term any more because people immediately think you are nuts – UFO with the description I’ve given covers both bases and seems to be more acceptable.    I am sending with this report a photograph that almost stunned me when I first saw it, that was in Filer’s Flyer #35 email today, submitted by MUFON from Fayetteville, on August 24, 2013.  This picture is a striking resemblance to what I’ve been seeing, except for the color and the budge in the middle.  At precisely 9:30 there was a very large white “flash” of white light just north of North Captiva Island.  It was INCREDIBLE!  It lit up almost half of the sky for a brief second.  It looked like a bomb probably would have looked like.  I saw nothing directly associated with it as I was looking in that direction for 12 minutes before I had my next sighting.  Wow.  At 9:50 I saw again the same flying saucer shaped UFOs, again one above the other, right on the horizon, except that these seemed more amber colored.  They were in pretty much the same location as the earlier ones, about 2 to 3 miles off shore, but according to my notes from that night, they were further north than earlier, north of North Captiva, probably off of Cayo Costa.  The one on the top was no more than 300 feet above the horizon.   I watched them through my binocs for a few minutes, when the one above changed colors to an off-orange color, and the one below went out.  Shortly after that the one on the bottom came back on, still amber, and then went out again.  A minute or so later the single UFO slowly drifted upward and became a bright white and began to pulsate slowly.  It was easily visible with the naked eye at 8 plus miles away.  Then it stopped pulsating, got really bright, disappeared, and then all kinds of pinpoints of strobe light appeared, exactly like all of the “flashers” I’ve seen many times!!  WOW!  These flashes of white light were spread out to about half the width of my binocular field of view, which I’m guessing is around a quarter to a half mile at that far distance.  Most of the points of light of light would come on once every second or less, and there was an area where they were flashing rapidly, stop for a bit, and then do it again.  Then over a period of 4 to 5 minutes both the number of pinpoints of light, and the time between flashes, became slower and slower until they all stopped at 10:02.  I saw nothing else until 10:10 when I had to leave because of the no-see-ums.  This was an absolutely amazing sighting and I really wish I could get someone out here that has a good camera with a telephoto lens.  Both of my shark fishing friends have now independently filed UFO reports on what they have seen here, but they are only here on the weekends.  SOMETHING SPECIAL IS GOING ON OUT HERE!  I went out the following night and again saw similar things, and then the following, reports on which I will soon file.",2013-09-09T00:00:00,,

I pulled over and stopped and this thing was about 300 metres if that off the road and maybe 300 metres in the air.  I shot the video with my blackberry Z10 and one of my sons took the picture with his iphone and that picture was in full zoom.  My video was better than his so we used it.

I am a night watchman at an abandoned coal mine just north east of Farmersburg, IN, approximately 15 miles Southeast of Terre Haute, IN. The yellow/orange object was first observed on the previous Saturday morning, 8-24-13 at approximately the same time of morning.  I sit in a truck facing East and the object was in the sky and looked much like a star.  However, it continued to hover vertically and horizontally. There is an airport not far away and I'm used to seeing airplanes and knew this could not be a plane due to its unusual movement.  The craft drifted very slowly southward and occasionally would flash a brighter light. On Friday morning the 30th, as the craft continued to hover, another craft appeared much lower and north of the craft. It seemed to appear from nowhere. The second, lower craft was moving in the same manner as the original craft but slowly drifted towards the other craft and when it was close enough to hit it, it disappeared, as if it had gone inside the other object. The other (main) object continued to drift southward and looked as if it were scanning the terrain, as if mapping the landscape.  The area is remotely rural. After two hours, at 4:30 AM, a landfill that is nearby began operations and turned on two very bright flood lights to light the hill.  At that time, the craft seemed to be go stationary, as if to imitate a star. It was brighter than any star in the sky. The ""star"" remained visible, even after sunrise and eventually was the only star visible in the sky.  At that point I ended my shift and went home.  I did, however, call Coast to Coast AM with George Noory during this sighting and relayed what I was seeing on the radio. In this location I have noticed at least two dozen meteorites in the past five months at this location, all coming very close to me and all burning up approximately ten feet from hitting the ground.

Four more additional orbs followed along the same flight path (similar to a funeral precession) behind the initial two.  The objects were moving at steady cruising speed. The objects could be best described as soft fireballs with a diffused type glow.  The orbs were completely silent (no engine noise) and all uniform in shape and size.

I was sat on my veranda looking into the sky at around 22:10 when I noticed a very bright golden type light. I observed this and then noticed three same bright lights but small break away and form a straight line formation from where I viewed. The main formation looked like the batman embalm before it changed. The other three lights formed a a straight line on top of each other. There seemed to be a little cloud cover but I thought this was more smoke as everywhere else was clear on this night. It was is if it was a screen but thety cam out again. Whilst the three lights were on there own the massive bright golden light changed its shape very slowly. At first I thought this was the moon, but no chance and it happened very fast. The three smaller bright lights just seemed to join the bigger one. After joining there was a change again in the bigger one and then it was gone.  I monitor this area while I have a smoke and can say it is the final approach for Manila Airport. Most aircraft are at around 2,500 feet on final approach before a right turn from my view in the house. I know this after living here for 4 years.  These golden lights were about in my estimation about 25,000 to 30,000 feet above the turning point at ten mins past ten tonight.  I am not a crank, I know what I seen, the bigger light was changing shape all the time. They were very bright golden, it was as if thet new I was watching whatever was going on. It left a so called cloud that was not a real cloud.  At thirty thousand feet what I observed was huge, very huge.  Thanks and hope it helps out.",2013-06-02T00:00:00,,

Coast Line. An hour or two after dark, I was at the main local beach on the coast line of the Southern end of Monterey Bay.  I was out for a typical night time sea shore trail walk which I do off and on. I was up on a 35 to 40 foot bluff that overlooks this rocky shoreline beach. It was a fairly clear evening but quite cold, so no one else was down in this area at this time. While looking out over the Bay I noticed a bright orange object in the sky to the North. It was moving slowly South and towards me. I am 61 years old and have lived here for 60 of those years. I spend much time taking almost daily and many evenings walks down by the our rocky coast line. I have seen thousands of airplanes and even helicopters come in at night from the North (San Francisco Bay Area ) and South (from the Los Angeles area ). which land at our Monterey Peninsula airport. I know exactly what these look like (and sound like) at night from far away distances all the way, until they pass over my head and land at our local airport. This object looked nothing like regular air traffic.  It made no noise.  It moved very  slowly. It went perpendicular to the regular airport landing strip flight paths. It came right over me. It was quiet while doing so.  No engine or other motor noise at all. It had no small lights or bright landing ones.  It was just all bright orange.  Its shape was not exact because its bright light distorted this, but I kept thinking I was looking at a Chinese lantern.  It was a ball but with what seemed to be a somewhat beveled top and bottom. I have never seen a UFO and I must say I was a bit uneasy feeling when this passed over me at low altitude (guessing 1,000 feet?) and with no noise.  Its bright orange light was the same approaching as it was when it distanced itself after passing over me.  Approaching plane lights change once they pass over you. I figured this glowing orange object had to be the size of a large truck or small bus judging from its size at the altitude I assume it was at.  From my ground level vantage point, it was the size of small orange held at arm's length. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",2013-06-02T00:00:00,36.6175,-121.9213

My passengers and I got out of the vehicle and realized we were standing in the blue light.  It was dispersed all around us and we all started to look up in the sky to see where it was originating from.  There was a lot of cloud cover, but as the clouds moved a black rectangle appeared above us and glided to the right and then back.  It was a perfect rectangle and completely devoid of any light.  We all were a little intrigued, and scared.  I tried to take a snapshot, but my camera wouldn’t work. We all saw the same thing, and there was no explanation for this.

I hope this message finds you well and in good spirits.   I am turning to you with this because you have a better understanding of this universe, and are very open minded and connected individuals!  I just couldn't keep quiet about this extraterrestrial experience my wife and I went through a few days ago.  I think it's WONDERFUL what you're doing to challenge the minds of so many analytical thinkers.  I heard a statistic you said on a podcast about how 1 in 10,000 people don't speak out about what they witness/feel, and I will NOT be one of those who keep quiet!  Here goes... My wife and I just got back from the beach a few days ago (Sunday April 28 2013) and I just can't seem to shake what happened to us last Thursday (April 25 2013)  Okay, just to give you a little background information on myself, I am 30 years old born 3/4/83.  My family has always been HUGE into astronomy, and I know a good bit about the sky. I'm no expert, but I seriously grew up going out into fields with my uncle, grandma, grandpa, mom, dad, aunt, basically the whole family, and stargazing, and getting taught about the universe from a very young age anything from constellations to getting into philosophy conversations as to what we know about the universe.  Almost every one of them also own nice telescopes. So I guess you could say I'm an amateur astronomer.  I have just never witnessed anything like what happened, and I CANNOT get it off my mind. We had just arrived at our destination at Cherry Grove Beach in South Carolina around 8:00, and I have been DYING to get to the beach.  (I haven't been in like 3 1/3 YEARS, and I am a fish out of water...haha)  We proceeded to walk down onto the coastline.  We stood there for about 10 minutes on a pretty much empty beach.  The same night that we had that beautiful ""Pink Moon,"" gleaming down upon the surface of the water. My wife asked me what all that lightning was out over the water.  I explained to her about how lightning can't ground itself over water, and the charge jumps from cloud to cloud...etc etc etc.  I'm a bit of a science buff.  Anyways, as i finished explaining about the heat lightning,  I happened to turn my head to the right and look into the sky.  THIS is where it gets interesting... I noticed 3 lights in the sky, and could actually make out an isosceles triangular ""silhouette"" around the perimeter of the craft.  One light in the back and two in the front.  Two of the sides were longer than the one side in the front.  As I looked closer, it started moving very slowly towards the moon in the brightly lit sky.  I then grabbed my wife's shoulder, and asked her if she was seeing this, and that I am not losing my mind so to speak.  She validated with a yelling, ""YES,"" as we continued watching in awe as it moved SILENTLY across the sky.   Now, this craft had to be BIG.  I can't really determine the distinct size, but lets just say that it was approximately two, maybe more, football fields.  It was literally blocking out all of the stars behind it.   craft slowly crept across the sky for 7-10 minutes, and all of a sudden, the craft stops to a hover, and the underneath started sparkling!   Almost like a ton of high power strobe lights started going off all at the same time in a very spastic pattern.  It was SO beautiful and scary all at the same time. My wife pointed at another star, and asked me, ""Is that another one?""  I glanced over, and reassured her that it wasn't, and as we looked back to resume observing the craft ascended higher into the atmosphere and out of sight.  I told her…""This isn't over, there's GOT to be more to what we just saw.""  Well, little did I know at that moment, that my intuition was spot on.  We stood there for about 10 minutes talking about what had just happened.  MY wife's cousin, who was meeting us down there, called her cellphone, and she turned her back to the ocean, and walked away from me for a second.  I kept my eyes fixed on the night sky the WHOLE TIME.  As my wife was talking to her cousin on her cell phone, I was astounded to witness ANOTHER strange anomaly.  One Orb flashed bright Orange with yellow around the aura I guess you could call it. Flashed bright, then fizzled out as it fell in a random flight pattern. As that one burned out, one more, then another one! During the THIRD one, I turned and yelled ""TURN AROUND NOW!!!"" As she did, we both saw roughly 30 of these glowing Orbs moving frantically around a central area. They all seemed to move random at first, then it seemed TO ME like maybe that they were either attacking or communicating with the craft (not necessarily force, but more along the lines of telling it to ""GO AWAY""), or either going INTO the craft (as it looked as if the orbs were going though some kind of perimeter of the craft or force field.) It was in the same proximity of where the craft would have actually been in the atmosphere given the speed it was moving, and the direction it ! was moving, yet, you couldn't actually see the craft. I don't know...I have been at a loss for words, and the whole experience has been constantly turning over and over in my head. If there is ANY type of guidance, or advice, or ANYTHING, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks again for being so open minded, and giving yourself back to the universe and helping to open the minds of the world.   YOU ARE BEING HEARD AND MAKING AN IMPACT!",2013-06-02T00:00:00,,

I saw the 15-20 circular shaped objects fly, low-level (Appx 1000ft AGL), over my north Phoenix house on Saturday, 5/25.  As close as I was to them, you could see a candlelight burning inside what appeared to be helium balloons.  The color was definitely yellow, then orange.  The winds aloft were quite strong, so the balloons moved at a good pace until they flew far enough out of sight and burned themselves out.  I knew, as well as the other witnesses knew, that people would report seeing strange objects because they weren't close enough to see what they actually were.  If you were in a different part of the valley, it would have been easy to assume that these objects were extraterrestrial.  One of the other witnesses got video footage and he is a pilot, with an Aeronautical Engineering degree as well.  Our conclusion was it was definitely a HOAX.  Another witness was a retired Air Force airplane crew chief and worked as a civilian crew chief at a local Fixed-Base Operations.  After showing the video footage to some friends the next day, one lady commented that she had seen a documentary on the local news about people illuminating and releasing these balloons as a commemoration for family deaths and or ceremonious or tragic events that have occurred.  Definitely a HOAX. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  We are somewhat sceptical about this report.

I proceeded to go outside to investigate and continued to hear random ""booming sounds"" which seemed to originate in the distance to the east of me.

I searched the internet for fireworks displays in the area but found nothing. It is also unusual for fireworks displays to be put on in this area at such a late time of night and this early in the summer. After approximately 10 or 15 minutes the ""booms"" stopped.

Me, my wife and 4 kids were watching this.  Then about 50-100 yards before reaching I35 it turned north and we could see the bottom.  It was a perfect triangle shape with lights at the points that were not blinking and 3 lights in about halfway from the flat sides to the middle that were flashing.  It turned from flat to its side pretty fast but at a slow speed. It then was out of my view but the kids watched it until it was gone.  Last seen heading north towards Des Moines.

I am writing this because just as I thought I had figured which of the space craft were real and which of them were sensationalized on television I came across yet another.  My closer and First experience was in 1994. Those three were very different than this one.  I had a very different feeling come over myself as did my girlfriend that witnessed them with me in 1994.  Last night while wondering for hours, Northwest of Southern Utah's city of St George to the east of Gunlock Reservoir I was driving looking for a Father and Son's camp out with my First Grade son.  He had been frightened of the somewhat steep angled grade and being out in the middle of nowhere following the somewhat groomed dirt roads. I offered him a pillow from the back seat and he fell asleep.  I stopped the vehicle upon seeing a sign facing the other direction. I was worried I was going to forget the several small forks in the road that! I had passed and get more lost without bearing of how to get back to the St George area. I was determined to find where there camp was despite the late hour and the directions being rough at best.  My son was extremely sad that we had not yet found it before falling asleep which of course made me ever more devoted to using the necessary gas that I had earlier felt prompted to fill up with while back in town.  When I stopped the vehicle to get out and look at the sign on my left view-able from the opposite direction In the corner of my eye I saw bright lights shining in what seemed to be almost a kaleidoscope of colors.  Quickly it devoured my complete attention.  It slowly moved out from behind the ridge I had recently driven and appeared to be following the same single lane dirt road I had been traveling for quite some time.  At very first in the corner of my eye I saw definite blue and red colors thinking of police but was amazed to see the craft shining a wide range of color! s as it sat hovering there in mid air.  It dawned on me it seem! ed to ha ve been following me. I watched it for a short while not sure as to what my best move would be and thinking back on the  Three much closer crafts I had seen within rock throwing distance on the beach in Northern Oregon in 1994 at Battery Russell.  That was an even more incredible experience that took place with my High School sweetheart. In defense mode I went and grabbed my 40 cal that was loaded with Pest Shot and switched the magazine to hollow points self defense rounds. I quickly closed the back door and walking around to the drivers side again looking back over to where it was and wondering if I dare to keep going to what seemed like a small dead end camp site in the middle of no man's land.  Realizing I had no cell phone reception, my son to protect, and no one likely within miles, I jumped into the truck and used the backward fork in the road to turn the truck around. I was nearly to Menganese springs as the distance I had traveled had been extensive and took quite some! time.  I believe it was close to Cole Springs as well.  When I hurried around to the Drivers side of the Vehicle I wondered how long it had been following me.  Though it made no noise and stayed at about a 1/3 to 1/2 mile distance just hovering I started to run different possibilities and potential outcomes through my mind. I would rather confront or make known my acknowledgement of it's presence than to be surprised in the middle of the night in a tent put up by headlights of my vehicle.  I could not find a flashlight before heading out and was pretty committed to making our own camp site at Manganese Springs.   As if things had not been startling enough on my somewhat quick drive back to the ledge where the road veered around an outcropping somewhat high formation of rocks I drew closer to the spot where I had seen it and shut off my lights as I got closer to the location.  Even with my lights off I could see enough to stay on the road with some amber light from the 2013 New Ve! hicle I was driving and was astonished when I saw two glowing ! dots and what appeared to be a bipedal in the middle of the road.   I quickly turned my headlights on only to find a large black cow starring me down like deer in headlights. Part of the reason I think I was driving for hours was the fact that I had to drive through an Indian Reservation to get to the general area where the camp out was supposed to be held. Convinced the craft was gone I thought to myself I could not venture out to satisfy my curiosity with my son with me. The curiosity from my first experience had never left me and I was once again amazed to find this single craft to be very different in appearance than my first sightings of three glowing white saucers from the beach where I failed to notice the closed at dusk sign while driving onto the beach for a small fire to make smores. That location was not far from the Peter Iredale Wreckage at Fort Steven's State Park on the Oregon coast. I drove for what felt to be hours trying to get out of the abyss of the ""moonlight! -void"" desert finding more cows in the middle of the road that I strategically dodged on my drive back to civilization. I haven't slept well of course and it happened just Friday night now being Saturday night. I stayed up late with my wife and earlier in the day she had described to me what she and her family had seen about 13 or 14 years back in Southern California. Strangely enough I believe the craft that she saw in broad daylight sounded to be very similar to the one that I saw last night. I am writing  this because I can't get over the different feelings I had that quickly followed the two different sightings I experienced. Crazy to think most people might go there entire lives and never see anything like this. Interestingly enough I was recently talking to a new friend of mine about his experience recovering an unauthorized plane that was forced to the ground by fighter jets in area 51. After pulling into my neighborhood I received a call from an unauthorized nu! mber only to find out it was the sheriff and they were getting! ready t o send out search and rescue as my phone had died before I could finish the conversation with my wife around the Indian Reservation on my trip out there. After taking some flack from my loving wife I jumped on the internet after making it home. I was a bit surprised to see that I was just east of what my friend called the HUGE airport in the middle of nowhere. I'm not sure what if anything is gained by this information but I would be curious as to with whom and where it is shared. I could never deny even the first experience let alone last nights amazing adventure and if anything feel more aware by it's occurrence. After inviting an old friend over to a party I held a few years back that hypnotized my wife and her friend in front of about 12 other friends, I have been curious as to what else if anything may have taken place. Part of me would rather leave it alone but I am not one to give up the search for answers. Just for the record, I have NEVER drunken alcohol or used dru! gs in my life. I was not raised in Utah but do like the sober God Fearing people where I now live. Feel Free to share this with whom ever it may help. I took video on the dark dirt road in hopes to catch anything I pulled up on. Looking back I feel a bit ridiculous for chasing after it. I would love to see and learn more about them. Only time will tell. I don't know if time lapsed I just know the it took several hours on my search for the camp out only to find scary cows and and a colorful UFO.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,37.13106124401914,-113.58876315789475

I was a teenage boy at the time. I was watching adults hanging around outside the bar and chatting with a friend. A light was moving from left to right slowly across the horizon. It never looked like it was very high in the sky. It looked to be very far away. The object was changing colors. Red, white, blue, red, white, blue, in smooth transition, color changed ever five seconds or so. No blinking or flashing. It appeared to be one light. As the object got in a 1:00 position it started getting closer and closer at a very high rate of speed. Faster than any aircraft I've ever seen.

It looked to be one object the way the lights moved in formation but I can't be certain.  It looked like the lights took up about the same space as a full size van...maybe a bit bigger.

Detail: The first orb was seen at just after 12am, starting at the horizon to the west. It was very bright orange that seemed to flicker instead of strobe or blink. As it moved higher in the sky (~20 deg. elevation), a second orb that looked exactly the same started from the same area on the horizon, and followed the first. Then after about one minute of flight the second orb changed direction, and circled below the first orb (with several degrees of separation in the sky between the two). As the first orb moved to ~45 deg. in the sky, it started to move south, then  it faded away (darkened) until it was not observable. The total time it took from start to finish was between 2-3 minutes. As the first orb disappeared, the second was still visible between 20-30 deg. in the sky, and then it faded out ~1 minute after the first. After the first two disappeared, ~2 minutes later a third started from the about same location on the horizon, and had a flight path similar to the first. It moved almost straight up to ~45 deg. elevation, then veered south, and faded out after ~2-3 minutes at ~60 deg. elevation in the west-southwest sky. The only time there was more than one orb in the sky were the first two; after that they only appeared one at a time, with ~6 minutes total from the start of one to the other (~3 minutes of visible flight, then ~3 minutes until the next one started)  Conclusion: We witnessed several more (at least 10 total) over the span of ~50 minutes, starting from around the same location on the horizon, then move in a similar flight pattern to the first and third orbs. After they stopped we went inside, so there could have been more later. Although they weren't in any discernible formation, they did all fly approximately the same flight pattern and had approx. the same start/finish position. It was hard to get any reference to altitude, speed, or distance against the dark sky; but I would guess they were flying anywhere from 1000-2000 feet above the ground. They didn't make any erratic movements, no sound, and their speed seemed fairly slow to moderate. There were aircraft in the area at the time; but they were most likely just commercial/small aircraft that weren't involved with the sightings (they didn't seem to be following/intercepting them). Although, they did give a good reference as the lights on the aircraft were 100% different then the orbs. We also could hear the aircraft but not the orbs, and the orbs seemed to move slower across the sky compared to the aircraft. Extra details: From our position we couldn't directly see the horizon as the buildings/trees were obscuring it; so I can't 100% know if they started in mid-air or from the ground. This to me is the biggest factor, as if they started from below the horizon the there's a 90% probability they were something man-made i.e. Chinese/sky lanterns. But from where we observed them it seemed they started either right at or just above the horizon, making them harder to I.D. I do have a military background (U.S. Navy 2000-2004) with an honorable discharge. I have also studied military equipment/aircraft throughout the years, and these did not act or look like any kind of aircraft or other manned object. The other three witnesses (my co-workers) are credible with good work ethics. One is even a skeptic that was trying to explain them as aircraft lights, but I'm 99% sure they weren't manned aircraft. I have also seen a UFO while in the service in 2003, but it had different characteristics than these.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,40.59851098901099,-106.90830989010989

When I saw it I was thinking to myself is that a star in the middle of the day? So I decided to stand there and watch it.  At the time I was wearing sunglasses and when I took them off all I could see was barely a little light in the sky.  With them on as I was watching it I noticed it was slowly moving through the sky, is was quite a ways out but I could clearly make out a few odd things.  The UFOs light was waving back and forth as it was slowly moving one direction and then all the sudden going another direction.  As I stared at it for a good five minutes I also saw what seemed like a very shiny metallic metal as it was moving around in strange ways.  There were no lights like an airplane or helicopter has and it wasn’t moving around like any aircraft I have ever seen I was absolutely sure it was some sort of UFO.  Since me and my mother both strongly believe in aliens I ran into the hou! se to get her, threw my sunglasses on her and took her out to see what I did. 					Witness #2 					 	At approximately 1:45 I was sitting on my couch in my apartment when my son burst through the door exclaiming that I “needed to get my sandals on and come with him”.   I had to ask him to slow down and tell me again because he was very excited.  I put on my sandals and followed him out the door and down the stairs asking him what was going on.  He told me that he had seen a ufo.  He said he had been watching it for about five minutes before risking losing it to come get me so that he could have someone else witness it. 	I walked with (behind, had a hard time keeping up in his excitement) him to the road where he started looking up into the sky in a northern direction.  He told me where it was and I looked up and was able to see something.  It was just a metallic dot in the blue sky which at first I thought could have just been a plane high up in the sky.  But then my son told me I needed to use his glasses and I put them on and could REALLY see it.  At first I wasn’t sure what I was seeing although I could tell it was metallic because it was waving (or rocking perhaps?) and as it moved, the light would shine on it and it would sparkle. I could not see the shape but I could see that it was what I would call masked or cloaked as sometimes it would appear to be larger and it appeared to have a shape kind of like an oval or tilted saucer but it was like, see-through or reflecting the sky or something.  I think this sounds insane.  I am almost doubting what I just saw because it seems so out there. 	We followed it around some trees as it headed north after it went around in circles for a while, changing directions and wagging.  All of a sudden it headed north and didn’t “play” anymore.  It just disappeared about three seconds later.  It was there and then it just wasn’t. 	I turned around and my son touched my arm and said “look” and pointed to the sky on the other side of town and I could see a jet climbing at an unusually rapid and straight up motion, heading in the basic direction where the craft was.  We commented on the idea that it could be headed towards the craft and headed inside.  On the way in we noticed that from another point in the sky from the southeast, (the first coming from the northeastern direction) there was another jet headed in what appeared to be straight up just like the first. In the direction of the craft in the sky.  That was the last thing we/I saw and then we came in the apartment and sat down to report it.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,44.063,-116.7038

Then a single red orb appeared from the western sky moving at the same speed and direction as the others.  When it was directly north from us it vanished as well.  A final red orb appeared from the western sky and did the same thing as it's predecessor.  After that the sky was clear.  There are absolutely no clouds around besides directly overhead so it they couldn't have just went behind a cloud to vanish.  My friend with me saw this and said that he saw white lights that vanished as! soon as I pulled my car over.  I did not see these as I was driving the car and was not able to stare at the formation.  I tried to take a pic with my phone but it would not pick up the lights that far away.  This was in West Des Moines in an area with plenty of lighting.  Time was 8:25 PM so it was dark.,2013-11-20T00:00:00,41.5638941436464,-93.77826066298343

The bench faces West, I was sitting on the South end facing north while he was on the North end facing south when I noticed something in the sky behind him, to the North.  It was a sphere shaped, bright orange glowing ball that moved rather slowly as compared to aircraft observed in the area.  I never wanted to post about this before, but since this is the third time I've seen this phenomena this year, I decided to research to see if I was the only one who is seeing these things and now I’m here telling my story, reluctantly due to my profession. My first sighting took place on New Year’s Eve of this year and there were six objects that night, of the same description as previously mentioned but they appeared to be traveling in formations of two.  The first two came from the south at a very high rate of speed, moving north; one behind the other, at the same speed then appeared to stop over us, at the same time, almost like they were attached.  When those two stopped, two more came from the south in the same manner, appeared to be the same distance apart from each other as the first two and actually moved on a slightly north, north westerly direction and slowed to a stop while the third set came from the south in the same manner as the other two sets but was even more slightly to the north westerly direction and slowed to a stop as well.  By this time I had everyone’s attention to them and the objects slowly disappeared over us, all at the same time.  It was witnessed by almost everyone at my house that night, approxim! ately 8 to 10 people and this whole incident occurred within approximately 30 seconds. The second sighting, I had only seen one of them but it was traveling south at a very high rate of speed and I watched it until it disappeared in the horizon.  I was the only one who observed that one and I didn't think anyone would believe me but this sighting only lasted approximately 3 to 5 seconds.  Please note that the directions listed are approximate or in that general direction.  I hope I didn't confuse anyone with the details.  I would also like to add that I did see a Chinese lantern one night a few months ago that someone launched from the next street over from me and the lights I saw did not resemble the characteristics of the lantern at all.  The lights I saw were much much brighter and didn't flicker like the lantern did. The only photo that we had was from a cell phone and was not very clear or showed anything more than a stationary light. I tried to include as much information as I could remember or even describe in this report.",2013-11-20T00:00:00,30.21463846153846,-90.93991888111888

On 5 July 2013 shortly before 2200 hours six adult witnesses including one Deputy Sheriff from Washington State were at a residence in Chelan Washington on the back deck of the residence overlooking Lake Chelan.  The deck of the residence faces northwest and looks out across Lake Chelan with an unobstructed view.  The weather was clear and about 75 degrees with some light haze to the north from a forest fire about 20 miles away but the sky was clear directly over the residence. The group of six adults were all together when we observed an orange light in the shape of a circle or orb.  The relative size of the object was difficult to determine but our estimation is that it was about the size of a Boeing 747.  We believe the object was at an estimated altitude of between 20,000 to 50,000 feet traveling from the northwest to the southeast.  We believe the object was moving about twice as fast as a visible satellite so a rough estimated speed may be 10,000 to 20,000 miles per hour.  The object made no noise as it passed overhead.  As the object passed over the house the group ran to the front of the residence facing southeast and observed the object make a course change from a southeast direction to a south direction.  The course change was obvious but not instant (more gradual like an airplane might make). The glow of the object was that of a yellow orange steady color.  The relative light being emitted by the object stayed steady as the object came into and went out of view.  It did not fade like a satellite does as it passes into and out of the shadow of the earth.  Again the size of the object was difficult to determine but the speed was about twice that of a typical satellite viewing.  Just to be safe we did check where ISS was using the iPad app Starwalk and it was not in view at the time.  In terms of size if you were to hold a dime out at arms length the diameter would have been a little more then half the size of the dime.  The observers included four people in their mid-30's, and two in their mid-60's.  The group includes a business banker, deputy sheriff, retired medical assistant, a business owner, and two stay at home moms.  3 of the 6 have bachelors degrees.  The word that comes to mind on this one is ""unbelievable.""  We did some research and are aware of the Boeing X51 but we are pretty firm on our minimum speed estimates of at least 10,000 MPH (that is a very conservative estimate).  The X51 is only at 4,000 MPH.  About 30 minutes after the sighting and the initial call into the UFO Center giving the above information we did observe a commercial jet liner pass overhead traveling west.  Estimating that the jet was at 30,000 feet at about 400 MPH to 500 MPH this helped confirmed the above stated speed, size, and altitude.",2013-07-14T00:00:00,47.8988,-119.9986

About 22:15 (10:15 pm cdt) on July 5, my family and I were sitting outside.  When I looked up into the sky, I saw a fairly large orange glowing orb moving rapidly overhead right about 90 degrees of elevation.  It moved from East to West (retrograde, so was not a satellite) and lasted about a minute.   The brightness did not seem to change other than dimming as it moved away from us.  The visual angle subtended an arc of about 120 degrees across the sky.   About one or two minutes later, we saw a group of three similar objects along the same flight path as the first one.  My daughter used an iphone to take video, but it is fairly dark and hard to distinguish the objects.   About 3 minutes later two more objects passed overhead, again on the same flight path. There was no sound from the objects.  It appeared as if they were glowing from heating up the atmosphere.   They moved much faster than orbital satellites (International Space Station, for example) or airplanes, but much slower than meteors and did not change brightness as a meteor would upon entering the atmosphere.  I am a retired military fighter pilot, retired commercial airline pilot and former astronaut.   I have no explanation for what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by former U. S. astronaut.

At first it looked like an airplane because it was blue with a red blinking light to the left side of the craft.  However, it was moving very quickly straight upwards, a lot faster than any aircraft I had ever seen, so I watched it because it was quite unusual.   Then it stopped completely and suddenly.   It then moved towards the left very quickly, then stopped..  I was then calling for my boyfriend to come and look at this since he is an aircraft inspector and what I was seeing was quite bizarre.  He came out as soon as he could.  When he got there, the craft had moved back into it's original position, but then the blue light changed to green but the red light was still blinking and then it slowly started to descend in the sky and disappeared behind the tree tops.   Some other people were lighting fireworks off in the neighborhood, but not in that area that the craft was i! n and I've never seen a firework or anything of that nature perform these maneuvers or blink in the way it was blinking because it looked just line any other airplane.

We live on an unincorporated street between two cities and so people come to this neighborhood to shoot them off legally. I walked out the back sliding glass door, which faces North, and in the NE I saw a light that was far more definitive than any firework.  It was consistent and moved toward my direction at a hovering, casual pace.   As it came closer, the lights and shape became more defined.  It was difficult to say a distance but my best guess at its closest proximity - 2 miles away.  If I had to judge relative size, I'd say a 50 meter diameter.   I always imagined something more extravagant if I ever saw an object I couldn't rationally explain but the object had a saucer style shape with a small ball on top.  Colors rolled from the underbelly of the disc, all the way up to the ball from a soft yellow, to a dull orange and the ball was almost red. I saw it coming in for about 10 secs, at its closest proximity for about 10 secs, silent and motionless, in which time I yelled twice to my neighbors two house down, ""Does anybody see that?!""  I'm certain that the fireworks and children yelling drowned out my voice or they simply thought I wasn't talking to them because nobody responded.  I took out my phone and called a friend to tell him about what I was witnessing.  In about another 10 secs, it silently slipped away at exponential speed, directly north and then up, out of sight.

UFO Sighting - July 5, 2013 10:30 - 11:00 PM EST  Three witnesses were on a balcony in Kinston Plantation, North Myrtle Beach, SC.  One witness was gazing out over the ocean and saw a strange set of lights that were rotating in a horizontal circular motion very close to the condo.  She told the other two witnesses to come outside and see this UFO.   They both came right away and saw the same thing.   We ran to get our video camera.  By the time we got back to the balcony, the object had moved horizontally to the southeast of us away from the ocean.  We shot some still pictures and by the time we videoed, it was very small and far away.  However, we noticed there was another red light to the bottom left of the larger set of lights.  After a moment, the smaller light joined the larger set of lights. We looked up the UFO Hotline number and called immediately to discuss next steps.  We were told to give the direction we saw the UFO and describe it.  While we were speaking to them, the UFO moved back toward us Northeast out over the ocean behind our condo out of site for us.    We were then able to video the circular flashing lights that were red, blue and white.  At one point, it changed and took the shape of an angel with the white light coming down in the middle and the red lights on either side.   Sometimes the lights would be circular and rotate horizontally and sometimes they would be solid horizontal red lights.   At other times, the lights would just be blinking.  We were on the phone with the UFO hotline for 8 minutes reporting at starting at 10:42 PM EST.  We ruled out human aircrafts that we know of due to the wavy movement of the hovering of the object.   At one point, it was almost like it was standing still but it was making small fast smooth movements left and right and then left and right again.  After standing in roughly one spot for several minutes, the UFO was just hovering in one spot.  We were on the phone with UFO hotline the entire time after it came back in our view and recording video.

While at a stop sign we noticed a red object in the sky directly in front of us.  This object was star like in appearance and about the size of a large star.  I’m not sure how far away it was but it wasn’t close to us, the best I can guess it was about as high as a commercial jet would be and at a 45 degree angle.  The reason it caught our attention is the color.  I have never seen a star like object with this type of color.  It was a brilliant red color with a tint of orange, but more on the red side.  This object didn’t appear to be moving and because of our curiosity we continued west to find a better spot to pull off of the side of the road and look at it.  It is wooded on both sides of this road and by the time we found a spot where we could get a good look at it, it began to fade and within a couple of seconds it disappeared.  We continued west and began to talk about something else and my son said, “There it is”.  It was about 4 to 5 minutes between the time it disappeared and the time it reappeared.   We quickly found a spot to pull over, stopped and got a good look at it.  We tried to take a picture with my cell phone, but it didn’t work.  My son took our binoculars out and said that it looked like a regular star, but it was bright red.  Before I was able to look at it through the binoculars, it again disappeared.  We never saw it again.  Total good observation time was about 2 minutes. I had my private pilot’s license a number of years ago, I am an amateur astronomer and am reporting exactly what we saw.   It was not an airplane, any type of fireworks or anything that I can explain.  I have seen many satellites before, the International Space Station, all types of aircraft and it was none of the above.   Being a person who has looked through a telescope (6” Meade reflector) many times, it wasn’t Mars!   To sum it up, we saw this thing twice, it disappeared twice.  It was bright red, red-orange.  It didn’t appear to move.  There were no clouds in the sky.   Being a person who does not make stuff up, I can’t say it was some type of space craft, but was out of the ordinary.

The moon was bright, high above my yard and the sky was clear, I could see all of the stars. To the “south” of my yard, I could see what appeared to be a pulsing light, right above the distant tree line. I watched it for a couple of minutes, and it seemed to be moving, yet not as fast as a plane. I called the dogs back in as soon as I saw that it was rising yet becoming clearer. I wanted to turn the outside light off and watch without worrying about them, which is exactly what I did. I stood on my front steps and watched as the pulsing became brighter, and the closer it came, the more defined the beams surrounding it became. It was the most beautiful thing I think I’ve ever seen. There was the pulsing center, sure, but I could see what looked like a row of blinking dots that ran horizontal and the beams were varying colors, rainbow almost, with white rays mixed in along the bottom. The colored beams were separate, and went in all directions. I wondered if I was witnessing the death of a star, until it started weaving from side to side, and what appeared to be back and forth, upward and downward, slowly. Almost as a seagull does against the wind, trying to stay in one spot. I went inside and woke my son up to confirm what I was seeing, and he definitely saw the colors, the pulsing that was different from the blinking lights in the middle. And, promptly went back inside wanting nothing to do with it. I brought my female dog back out and walked to the end of my yard attempting to get a picture on my phone but the distance was too great for the quality of my device. While trying to do so, my dog started to whine, whimper, and slightly growl. Her fur stood completely on end, and she leaned her shoulder into my knee. What I’m about to share might have me sounding like a complete lunatic, but, honestly? I’d rather everyone think I’m nuts than not share it. She was looking over at our neighbor’s yard, and when I turned to see, there were three sets of eyes looking back at us. About my height, I immediately assumed deer. These were no deer I have ever seen. They turned to “run”, and they were far from anything I’ve ever seen, except for mutations shown in movies. They were hunched over, their heads more in front of their bodies, and they “loped” in almost an orangutan fashion. They were FAST. They appeared fur-less, and an odd brownish color. My dog started to run after them, and the last of the three “creatures” stopped, turned, and looked directly at my dog. My dog halted, and LAY DOWN. I called to her, and the sound of my voice caused the shiny eyes to turn away, and off it went with the others. My dog remained stationary until they were out of sight, and then bolted toward the door to the house, with me right behind her. I locked the door, looked out the window, and the pulsing light was still there, but moving south west without the colorful beams…I know it makes me sound crazy, and I don’t care. If these creatures weren’t related to that light in the sky, then I’m one lucky girl to see both things! However, my dog will not go out alone now, so I think we may have been far luckier than we know.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,41.4775,-71.7702

On 8:04 PM of September 25th 2013, I was on State Route 520 Eastbound towards Redmond/Avondale when I looked southward, past Marymoor Park; in the sky were seven objects.  These objects were above the horizon, and were too high in the sky to be lights in the Marymoor Soccer Fields or streetlights on one of the hills that surround Redmond.  The reason I determined that the lights were not in Marymoor Park was the fact that they were bright enough to be seen past the lights on the soccer fields; which were bright enough to drown out the stars and most other light source beyond them.  These objects were in two groups, four in one, three in another.  The four were higher up in the sky, and were in a finger-four formation, the other three were lower and in a triangle formation.  The objects were red-orange lights, and shined steadily rather than blinking.  All the objects were identical.  Also, the objects did not seem to be moving; however, they could have been at v! ery high altitude and moving slowly, or the fact that I was in a moving vehicle at the time of the sighting meant that I couldn’t observe the UFOs moving. I believe that they are UFOs because I cannot see any other reasonable explanation.  The objects were bright enough to be seen over the floodlights of Marymoor Park, discounting the possibility of them being stars or planets.  Unlike planes, these objects did not have any other lights other than the red-orange light that allowed me to see them; they did not have the red and green lights on the wings, and they did not have any white lights on the nose.  I believe that the objects cannot be blimps or hot-air balloons because, I have never seen or heard of seven light-than-air aircraft flying in such precise formation at any time, much less at night.  I do not believe that the objects are helicopters because, one I heard no sounds from the helicopter’s rotor blades, also, the helicopters did not have any sort of lights on. I have thought of one possibility of what these lights are, other than UFOs of course:  I think that the lights could be afterburners on military aircraft, perhaps out of Mcchord Air Force Base south of Tacoma, Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, or a base in Oregon or Idaho.  The fact that the lights were south of Redmond, towards the Mcchord Air Force Base area, could support this thesis.  However, if they were aircraft, they were not sporting any lights other than their afterburners, which is dangerous to say the least.  Some conspiracy theorists might say that the government was conducting “hush-hush” testing at Mcchord Air Force Base.  I think the military would not do that, for one reason.  Airspace around Mcchord is busy; if a secret military test was being conducted in the area of the sighting, the testers would risk a collision with another airliner.  I would think that the military would conduct such testing at an area like Area 51 or Edwards Air Force Base.  Therefore, I believe my alternate theory of it being a military jet in afterburner to be unlikely.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,47.679040334236674,-122.11505415537488

I first saw two objects that appeared to be satilites.  They both were headed Southeast from the general direction of snowbird ski resort.  Keep in mind they looked like satilites and were nearly directly straight up from my location.  I lost interest and called my dogs. I looked up again as small patch of clouds covered the leading satilite.  On the other side of the cloud I saw more lights moving along the same path in a south east direction.  Once all the objects cleared the cloud the satilites were in a triangular formation.  The triangle was equilateral. In the middle of each flat of the triangle there was a satilite.  So in all there were six satilites, three at each point and one dividing each flat.  I believe this formation was in orbit and not in the atomosphere.  The formations size is unknown. But judging from the distance I would say the object had a base length of twenty miles and each leg was twenty miles.  Taking into account my visual angle the object ! took up a relatively small patch of sky.  After observing the object for a time I noticed a diamond moving with it and directly ahead of it.  Each point of the diamond had a light/ satilite at each point.  Two satilites trailed it waving back and forth like a tail.  This object appeared to have a light mist on its interior.  The second formation was about an 1/8 the size of the delta. I second guessed that the clouds moving may have tricked my eyes.  Possibly these were star formations and the clouds moving Northeast made them appear to be moving.  Upon thinking this I noticed the formations moving relative to the stars and the stars didn't pass through them.  The speed of the formations was slow but fast enough to cover the 50% of the sky I observed it move through before disappearing behind a cloud front.  I am in the aviation industry and I know that aircraft have green lights on right wing, red on the left and white on the tail.  All the lights were white.

The way it moves around is not that of a helicopter, and i've never seen a helicopter light up that bright, ever. Airplanes can't move back and forth or in that close proximity to each other. Lanterns cannot move left to right, right to left numerous times without changing altitude. Planets and stars don't move around like that.  Satellites do not move like that.  My youtube video is here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGh86IMk68M  You can find 5 total videos showing the bright light, my most recent one I linked to you guys is probably the best I have.  Whatever it is, it looks beautiful and magnificent, especially seeing it with your own 2 eyes, the key points i'd like to highlight in that video above are:  Watch closely around 1:50 on the video, the 2nd light appears and they seem to be flowing in motion and fluently with each other.

She then pointed into the sky towards the west where there was an orange orb-like thing that is probably one of the “fireballs” everyone else has been talking about.  The structure was moving east, but more towards the southeast.  About 30 seconds later, a second orb appeared and was moving in the exact path of the one in front of it.  I then ran inside to get binoculars with my brother and when we came outside the two we had seen previously had vanished.  According to my parents who were still outside when we went in, they had just disappeared a little after we had gone inside. After we were out with our binoculars, about 30 seconds late when we were just looking around, another orb appeared in the west, but this one appeared brighter and also looked as if it either had two sections to it or it was two orbs in tandem with each other.  After about 10 seconds, they had joined and there was only one bright orange orb there moving southeast like the others.  When I was looking at it through the binoculars I started to notice this black circle starting to engulf it.  I kept watching, as was my brother, and we both looked away in amazement when we saw it turn completely black. We thought it was gone like the others, but then my brother noticed a black dot in the sky that was really weird to see.  This was just after the sunset, so there was some light in the sky still. We went over to look at it and it was still moving after stopping briefly in the sky. It then moved towards the direct south and then began to move down.  We couldn’t see it after that, so we d! on’t know if it landed or if it was just moving out of our view in the sky. The orb looked a lot smaller with the binoculars on rather than the naked eye and the majority of the light looked like it was coming from the top of it. Also, we were talking about it after and we were wondering if the structure cut its power to either go in orbit or maybe even land. My mom was waving to them in the air and she thinks she saw them stop when she waved. However, she says there’s a chance it could be her imagination, but you never know with these! This isn’t our first encounter with these. Two summers while we were camping in the Adirondacks, we saw two very bright orange orbs that were pretty close to each other. This is interesting to me because on the website here it says the reports mostly were after June 2012 and this would’ve been July 2011. Also, my parents saw a whole group of them form some sort of a pattern last summer when they were coming back from a concert. They stopped on the road a got to see the whole “show,” but when they called me and my brother at home they were gone and we didn’t get to see them. I have no idea what these are, but I do look forward to hopefully seeing more in the future!",2013-07-03T00:00:00,43.1587,-76.3327

From there we both witnessed it slowly and silently float toward the E/NE. At the time the conditions outside were wet and very overcast.  This orange orb traversed our field of view in approximately ten seconds, which led me to believe that it was not a Chinese lantern.  In fact my first thought was that it could be a meteor however I feel that it moved to slowly. As I mentioned the weather was poor and the clouds were low but I can’t say for certain what altitude the orb was traveling at.  If I were to guess I would say 300 to 500 feet. At our horizon, which due to our house being at the bottom of a hill was only maybe 100 yards from us, is a grouping of trees.  The orb passed over these trees and for a few seconds we could still see it through the branches and leaves on the other side.  Then it was gone. We came inside and noted that the time was 21:38. As a side note the evening before this sighting my wife and I saw an unusual light over a mile to the east.

June 29, 2013 -  2230 EDT  46*02'35.57”N   91*56'43.15”W  Two of us, heading west on HWY 77 east of Minong Wisconsin saw four lights in the sky.  We were near a lake McClaine.  The four lights at first appeared stationary over the west shore of the small lake.  When we realized they were moving we pulled the car off the road, turned the engine off, radio off, fan off, lights off.  We realized one of the lights was going to pass right over us and we wanted to determine if there were any engine noises.  None.  Completely silent.   We got out of the car.  The lights at first seemed to be moving in the same direction but then separated.  Oh, they were at first moving from North to South.  Then, one moved west and vanished, we thought into the haze.  One disappeared before it got to us, one to the east and vanished.   The one that moved above us was pulsing as it continued to the south, and then the light went out and we saw a dark mass continue moving to the south.  The sky was hazy, not quite dark, but full of twilight.  I could not take my eyes away, and it did not occur to me to try to get a video as I did not want to miss any part of the event.  Then it was over.  It lasted for about three minutes or so.   I am wondering what it could have been and if anyone else reported seeing it.  In retrospect I cannot determine the altitude.   At first my friend thought they were the top lights of four transmission towers, and that they were near the lake.  But then we think it is possible they were very very high, and at first very far away, but moving rapidly towards us to give the appearance of being stationary.   I tried to determine if, after the lights went out, if there was perhaps some debris that would be falling.  Instead what I saw was the dark mass continue moving at the same pace as the light was.  It did not lose altitude.   We argued for some time as to the nature of the event.  I said it was a phenomena.  He explained it as an explosion of some kind, perhaps a meteor or an aircraft, but we do not know of anything that would burn like that.  It seemed somewhat ethereal. He also said that he thought the dark mass may have been smoke because it appeared to expand.  I did not see smoke, there was no smoke trail behind it.  Yet we both agreed that the way that it moved was inexplicable.   When we got home less than an hour later he called our local police as well as Superior Wisconsin to report it.  I went to the internet to see if anyone else was talking about it.  That is how I found your page, and I called you.

I was out walking my dogs in the back yard when I saw 2 strange lights in the west sky (I live in North Eastern Louisville).  They were travelling in the same direction and one was in front of the other.  I can’t say how large they were or how far apart they were due to the distance.  However, they appeared to be travelling over the Indian Hills area in North Eastern Jefferson County. At first I thought they were floating Chinese lanterns, but I determined that they could not be lanterns due to the speed at which they were travelling.  They seemed to glow orange/gold and flicker sporadically.  I immediately took out my iPhone camera and videotaped the lights, but they were so small in the video.  I then noticed that there was another light in front of the other two, also travelling the same direction.  As I ran up to the house, the first light faded into the cloud cover. When I reached the house, my daughter joined me outside and she also captured video of the two remaining objects.  As the 2 closest ones were starting to fade into the clouds, one final light appeared through the trees, following the previous three.  We both agreed that these were not a normal aircraft that we are familiar with;  UFOs by definition.  The area where the objects appeared is close to the flight path that passenger jets use as they round into their landing pattern at the Louisville airport.  However, these lights appeared much lower than any jet would travel, and there was no sound.  There were no blinking lights on the objects, just the occasional flickering.  The objects appeared as if they were completely illuminated; glowing.  They were close enough to see that they had some mass, not just a light in the sky.  But I couldn’t determine how large they were.  And they all had the same steady pace and straight flight.  I wouldn’t say they were speeding across the sky, but they were travelling faster than wind would carry the objects.  Also, the wind was travelling ESE (1 mph) and these objects were travelling NW.

It began moving up, down, left right, in one general area.  Going up and below the tree line. We found this really hard to believe because of the previous night's experience. Same object golden, orangish colored ball of light. Zigzagging flight pattern.  Moving almost effortlessly.  After observing it for about 10 minutes, it lowered down and traveled S-SW until we could no longer see it.  About 20 minutes later, we saw it again, in the SW sky, but very high up in the air.   We watched it travel a vast length of the sky before disappearing after a minute or less.  About 20 minutes after that, we saw a slow moving aircraft approaching our house from the North.  As it traveled over our heads, it ha! d a low rumbling engine sound and we saw that it had 3 bright white circular lights on the underneath, forming a triangle with a red bright light in the center.  The lights were signaling in a beaconish sort of pattern.  White would blink and then the red. We have never seen anything like that either, but suspected that it was a man-made craft of sorts.  Certainly nothing like the fiery ball of light we had witnessed two nights in a row.  But the odds of seeing this recon-like craft about 40 minutes after our 2nd night in a row of a UFO sighting in the same spot, at the same time, was pretty strange, we must admit.  We will be looking in the same area in the low sky tonight at 9:00 to see if this ball of light appears again.

I photographed this object floating stationary in the sky on my way to a restaurant with my wife. It was on Friday, May 10, 2013, at approximately 4:50 p.m. when I saw the object in the sky. My wife was driving and I was in the passenger’s seat.  I first told her, “Hey, there’s a UFO in the sky!” and she said “Where?” and I said, “over there, on my side.”  She tried to look but couldn’t see because of her angle and because she was driving. I quickly had the presence of mind to take out my camera phone and snap a picture of the object although I did not have time to zoom in; I was more concerned about capturing the object. The photo was taken while the car was in motion so I was concerned that I hadn’t caught it on camera but when we arrived at the restaurant drive-through lane, I checked to see if I had caught it.  At first, I could not see anything but once I zoomed in and enlarged the photo in the screen, I saw it!  I showed it to my wife who was skeptical, stating, “It’s probably a bird”.  But, upon further inspection, I also caught a seagull flying through the air (very common here in Corpus Christi, TX).    And when I compared the two it was larger than the seagull and much darker.  What caught my attention initially was that it appeared to me to be a round piece of metal floating in the sky.  It was not traveling, had no wings to flap or fly with, so I knew it was not a bird or a plane, again, it was stationary, not moving at all, not even bobbing and weaving in place just completely stationary which made me think it couldn’t be a jet either because you would definitely notice distance in t! he sky covered if a bird, plane, or jet.  This object had no noticeable lights as this was in the afternoon with slight overcast skies.  I was not going to report it initially, but then decided to, after a woman in CA caught a similar looking UFO in a photograph within a week or two of mine.  I do not have photo enhancing technology on my computer but I can zoom in and can tell it is not a seagull when I compare it with the seagull in the pic.  This had no wings, no motion, and no movement that I was able to witness.  I was able to keep an eye on it for about ten seconds before snapping the picture, this whole time it was absolutely still.  If you can enhance the photo object please let me know, I would appreciate it very much. Thank you.",2013-06-02T00:00:00,27.717500161812296,-97.40525129449838

More specifically, I saw a black triangle. Let me just state that this is probably going to be one of the most boring reports that you have received, but I felt I should share it none-the-less. On the night of 5/14/2013, between 2045 and 2100 central time, I opened my front door to let my dog outside.  I followed her, and just like always, I happened to look up into the sky.  There it was, moving swiftly and silently, directly over my home. My first thought was that it was some type of drone aircraft, then I immediately realized I heard no sound.  What truly caught and kept my attention was the lighted tips of the object, which formed a perfect triangle.  Also the lights were not very bright, however they were white (non-colored)  All three lights seemed to radiate at the same intensity, and the best way I can describe that is to adjust a dimmer lightswitch to about 70%. Another thing struck me as interesting as I reflect on what I saw, that it was flying in a ""skewed"" position.  Let me try to describe:  If you imagine an airplane, with a light at the nose and a light at the end of each wing, the light at the nose will always be in the lead, and the wing lights will always stay equidistant in their position, and  uniform as the plane moves forward.  The same would be true if there was no light on the nose, but two lights at the tips of the wing and one on the tail.  From a view on the ground, thee flat side with the two lights at the tips/edges would be moving forward (in the lead), followed by the light at the tail. This object flew forward as if it was turned at about 30 degrees off the center axis, so I could not tell what was in the ""lead"".  It only kept its  uniform,  steady shape as it flew. This entire sighting lasted approximately 10 seconds.  Of course, I had no camera with me, and I did run in and inform my wife of what I saw, and unfortunately there were no other witnesses. I recognized what it was from a historical fascination with ""stuff"" like this.  I had read enough non fiction about such instances to know that black triangles and the ""cigar"" shaped crafts are some of the most recognized shapes that have been recorded. So, I knew exactly what it was when I saw it. I want to try to contribute best I can to what I saw, so here are some specifics:  Shape of Tips-I did some internet research and found many descriptions as to the shape of the tips, ranging from ""boxy"" to ""pointed"".  The tips on this sighting were definitely more blunt and rounded, not pointed. Speed...well, I could not judge the speed but it was moving fairly fast for the sighting to only last for about 10 seconds, especially from the point of view I had. Size-If you take a half dollar out of your pocket and hold it between your index finger and thumb, and then extend your arm above you and look at the flat side of the quarter, that is about the size of the object from my ground perspective.  I have read that some witnesses state that these things are very very large.  Well, if they are, then from my view on the ground and the size approximation I described, it was fairly high up. Other features-some articles I have seen reference a light (red) in the center of the underside of the craft.  There were no other lights visible on the object that I saw. Direction:  I looked at google maps and found my home, and judging by its direction, it was traveling due north.  If you continue due north from Franklin TN, you will pass by the western edge of the city limits of Nashville. I hope this helps for your records.  Again, I never thought I would be reporting anything such as this, so this has truly been a fun exercise.  I just wish I had more to share.",2013-06-02T00:00:00,35.91850835322196,-86.88540525059665

While in a tree stand about 22' in the air I noticed a cylindrical shaped light moving slowly and seemingly tumbling.  I was looking at this object moving North westerly and put my rifle scope up to see it more closely. As I looked through the scope, set on 9x magnification, I could see it seemed to be on fire!  The front end looked to be pointing in the same general direction and the rest of the entire object looked like a yellow/orange sparkler.  The object moved at a steady rate but in an erratic way, like the tail end was dancing and sliding around while the ""nose end"" steadily pointed in a Northwest direction. I watched the object move for almost 10 minutes until I could no longer see it through the tree line. I stayed out for another 2 hours but did not see anything out of the ordinary.  This object seemed to be coming from the direction of the airport in Greensboro, NC, and moving north/northwest at a slow rate of speed.  No noise, because as other airplanes were flying over I could hear them.  There were numerous other airplanes flying in the air. I would be very interested to know if anyone else has claimed to see this or something like it in the area.  I go out at least 1 night a week hunting and this is the 4th time seeing something I could not explain since 2010....in the same general area.  Nothing I have ever seen looked like this object.

Unfortunately, I did not have any camera equipment or binoculars available.  I could not see the shape of the craft, but the lights appeared to be large (but different sizes), different colors of red, white, and yellow. There were approximately 5 to 8 different lights on each object.  The red light appeared to be the largest, but there were more of the yellow lights surrounding it.  I could not say for certain if the lights were flickering, but they did not appear to blink or pulse.   The lights formed an oval shape.  Both of the objects appeared identical to me.  They appeared at first to be very small objects, at least a few miles to the East, traveling steadily West (towards my location).  I can only estimate speed to be somewhat faster than a helicopter, but slower than a commercial jet.   The entire sighting was probably a full 15 minutes as the obj! ects approached my location before their ascent and disappearance.  There seemed to be a noticeable increase in speed as the objects ascended, but I can't really say for sure.  I did not hear any noise from the objects.  Everything was very quiet.  The objects followed a very similar (perhaps identical) westward flight path just a little beyond my location (about 8 miles from the Orange County airport) at an estimated altitude between 20,000 to 25,000 feet, and then ascending so high that the bright colored lights completely disappeared into the night sky. I feel confident that the objects ascended because they were getting smaller and smaller until I could no longer see them.  And I also feel confident that the objects would have needed to be higher than 35,000 feet to completely disappear because commercial aviation lights are still visible with my own eyes (at night while traveling at typical, long distance cruising altitudes).",2013-05-15T00:00:00,33.68653500837521,-117.79240477386935

I was smoking a cigarette on my 8th floor balcony two nights ago and saw some strange amber lights out over the lake.  At the range I was standing it was impossible to tell what I was looking at or how far away it actually was, but I was certain it was over the lake. It was raining and visibility across the lake was poor, the lights on the other side being completely obscured.  I looked at the weather network website that evening and noticed the wind was blowing 50kmh with gusts of over 70kmh.   When I saw the first amber light I thought it was an aircraft turning on its landing lights and circling in the storm.  I thought it was crazy for someone to be out flying in that weather.  The object moved left to right and disappeared as though the lights went out.   It then reappeared in roughly the same position it initially appeared and repeated what seemed like the same left to right pattern, at the same altitude before abruptly reversing left and descending on what seemed like roughly a 45 degree angle before disappearing again.  The way in which it abruptly went from moving right to moving left and the rate of descent was unnerving and suggested some sort of crash.  All this elapsed over approximately 2-3 minutes. I felt unsettled by how the light had behaved in it's movements seeming unaircraft like, there were no flashing lights of any kind through out.  I called my Father to the balcony to witness should the light reappear and it did approximately 1.5 to 2 minutes later.  It reappeared at approximately the same altitude and both my father and I saw it move left to right disappear and reappear in the same initial and repeat the left right pattern.   A second light, the same colour and intensity as the first, appeared falling from the sky what seemed like a fair distance to the right of the first leaving what I thought could have been a smoke trail but was impossible to tell given darkness and poor weather.  This light appeared at roughly the same height as the other object, perhaps higher and fell in an arc from right to left disappearing low to the lake.   I was so enthralled by strangeness of all this that I can't be sure when the first light disappeared, if it was before or after t! he second.  I asked my Dad, a retired detective, if he thought the second light was a flare.  He didn't think so.   Given the indeterminate range of the encounter and the poor conditions it was hard to say how high off the ground these objects were.  My instinct was that it was above the tallest buildings in town, but not very high in the sky.   The whole event did not take 10 minutes to elapse.  The amber colour was less orange than the street lights and looked more like fire.",2013-11-20T00:00:00,43.38223451178451,-79.82626717171718

They were arranged evenly spaced apart, emitting a bright light in the center of each spot, and i believe it had a bright light coming from the immediate side of the object. my brother on the other hand says he saw the profile of the bottom as we drove under it, and thinks it was a hexagon shape. we puled into a nearby parking lot and took a video of it as it made a tight zigzag flight path away for the next 5 or so minutes. might i add, no noise",2013-07-14T00:00:00,44.6447,-70.0074

As we were driving, we noticed a blue blinking light in the sky.  It was probably 75-100 feet off of the ground.  The light was above a house, so we thought it was a light on a pole, probably to signal to airplanes.   As we were driving, I noticed that we had driven past the light, however it seemed like we had reached the light sooner than what it should have taken.  I did a double take and at the same time my friend had noticed that the light was actually going past us and we were not driving past it.  We immediately stopped and did a U-turn so that we could head back into town. As we were driving into town though we noticed that the blue light had gone out further and was hovering over Kennewick, WA.  Soon after the light was over Kennewick we noticed it do a loop and a turn and start heading towards us again.  We were very afraid at this point so I started going about 70 miles an hour down this empty road, the light soon shot past my car and ended up being behind us.  The light did appear to be pursuing us, or at least heading in our direction, it never got to close to my car, it kept its distance at about 200 feet away from us.  We soon got into town, and as I looked into my rear view mirror the light just kind of dissipated into the air. 	The light was hovering above a  house on Road 100, that's why we had thought it was a pole because it had been sitting above this house for a few good minutes.  Once we got closer that's when the ball of light started to move.  The light was like a cobalt blue and it blinked the whole time.  I remember driving and seeing it flying by my car, it would blink and then blink out and be in another location when the light came back on. I would describe its movement being similar to a toy helicopter.  It would move in odd patterns and was very wispy like a toy helicopter would be, although it was much larger and faster than any toy I've ever seen.  The craft changed altitudes a few times where it would be very high in the sky and then lower to the ground, it was also very fast.  I don't know how many miles away Kennewick is from Pasco but it seemed to get out there pretty quick, considering this whole experience only lasted about 45-60 seconds. 	I wish I would have stopped to get a picture, but I was far to nervous to even think about my phone at the time.  The only other strange thing that happened that night was when we got home and my friend looked at her phone she had a strange picture file on her phone dated 12/31/1969 taken at 4:00 pm.  She can't delete the file, send the file or look at the file.  This may just be coincidence, but the file was not there before the experience.",2013-07-14T00:00:00,46.41000733944954,-118.9094880733945

I have seen small and distant sightings before but nothing like this.  As I’m smoking my cigarette, I looked to my right and as soon as I turned my head, I saw a bright, shiny light coming around the corner of the office building. I also noticed an orange light inside of the bright light.  The bright light appeared to be extremely blurry and moving at a very slow speed. It is very hard to explain and to put into words. The shininess of the light almost made it appear as if it was floating water or a jelly-like substance. It was extremely low to the ground and got as close as thirty feet from me before shooting up. The object didn’t shoot up much higher than it already was, but it was high enough to have to look up at the object. It then began moving West before disappearing.  During this time, I am also tried to take my cell phone out to take try to record the object. I opened my camera and switched to video mode. The grid appeared on my screen and the object was in clear sight on my phone. However, as I’m trying to press the “record” button, it will not record. I pressed it several times trying to get it to record until it disappeared.  Once I lost sight of the object, I thought that it had disappeared. All of a sudden, the light zooms back at a much faster pace right above me before heading northwest. All of my previous sightings have never been reported. I would see them and keep them to myself. This sighting was much different. When I saw the light, there was a huge and unexplainable rush of excitement that overtook my body.  I walked back into the office almost in a trance-like state. I went straight to my computer and noticed that it was 3:30 AM. A whole thirty minutes had gone by. Smoke breaks are only five minutes and ten minutes at max. I used the Internet to find the number and called the local Baton Rouge Air Patrol. A lady answered the phone and informed me that the tower in my city closes at 11:00 PM. She went on to ask more questions and was very intrigued with the details. She also mentioned that there were multiple sightings within the month that had been called into Air Patrol but nothing like mine; in regards to how close it all happened. This sighting was as real as it gets and I will never be the same because of it. It left me completely speechless.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,30.427367113194908,-91.08695572672472

They looked looked stars. However immediately I dismissed that assumption since first they were moving and second the sun was in the sky and no stars were visible except these moving lights.  Then I thought they might be air planes but I have seen many air planes when I look at sly everyday at high altitude.  The body of airplane is clearly visible in those cases and I can see the wings. but these were just spot lights.  With unusual bright white. I am sure they were not planes or any conventional crafts.  Moreover, they used to move not in a straight line but in a irregular shape flying NE.  They were going back and forward joyously and left and right sometimes but generally flying north east.  First I saw one and then I noticed they are three and then I spotted 7 or 8 of them.  They were flying together.  They were very far.  I changed my position to see if they change position in the sky in comparison to tree tops in the scene. but their location was unchanged in comparison to my movement indicating that those objects were really high in the sky. I tried to fit every other explanation instead of UFO such as maybe they are white birds lighted with sun in the morning. But they were not birds. I look at birds in the sky everyday (I do relaxation 1 hour a day in open field) and I can recognize their body, wings etc. Moreover birds fly in a direction not such a zigzag pattern back and forward, sudden 90 degrees turn, such as these objects. Then I tried to see them as papers or objects taken by wind to high altitude but the way they moved was inconsistent with objects who are blown by winds. They did not swirled like the wind rotate the object. They suddenly changed their direction a few times with right angle turns within 5 seconds. It was obvious someone is controlling that craft or light bulb. I am a mechanical engineer, PhD, and I know a little about craft movement types. These obj! ects (lights) were not moving like a regular craft such as we ! have. I have never seen an object moving in sly like that. Their light was sometimes changing form white to light pink and then again to white. I am a very skeptic person and I tried so hard to convince myself they are not UFOs.

At 17:30 I left work, driving south.  The sky was solid overcast, very lightly snowing, and the sun had set at 15:00 local time, on the north Alaska coast.  I noticed an odd light shining through the overcast to the south, which caught my attention.  I kept watching it as I drove about ¼ mile south to an intersection, where I stopped and saw rays or beams of whitish/bluish light shining down through the overcast, as if a powerful searchlight was suspended above the clouds, shining down.  The light beam did not reach the ground. Only the immediately surrounding clouds were lit, not a diffuse glow. I turned east at the intersection, and saw that the light seemed to stay in the same position. Intrigued, within a few hundred yards I turned off onto a side road, and positioned my truck so I could see the light and area around it clearly, put the vehicle in park and rolled my window down. I couldn’t hear anything but my truck idling, and it looked like the light was slowly drifting east above the clouds.  At this point I remembered to take pictures with my cell phone, with my arms extended out my open window.  I took the first picture, and the flash went off, so I turned off the flash and took another picture.  By the time I took the second picture, the light had faded almost completely.  From when I first noticed the light in the clouds until this point took about 5-7 minutes. I waited a few more minutes, then drove east for about a mile, where I saw a bright light in the sky to the east, over another well-lit oil facility about 3 miles away.  As I looked at this brilliant point of light, which was brighter than Venus on a clear dark night, it faded away, either going through the clouds or having a dense cloud layer obscure it, or by simply going dark. I checked with our weather observer and found that the cloud layers were at 6,000’ 5/8 overcast, 9,000’ 6/8, and 15,000’ 7/8.  My angle to the light was about 30 degrees above the horizon, so I estimate the distance to the object at 12,000’.  My feeling at the time of the sighting was a mile to a mile and half distance.

Except unlike fire, no light source is being produced.  There is no smoke or any type of debris falling from or floating with orb.  There is no sound.   Every orb that I have sited has been just that, a fire like orb appearing as a deep orange color.   though these orbs have been described as fire balls.  They don’t emit a glow as a fire would and they do not flicker the way fire, especially fire floating through the air would.   These orange orbs I have been siting are unique.  They are unique to me because I have seen something of a similar phenomenon in my native state.  Except the orbs I sited in my native state of Florida were red orbs of light that I saw numerous times over a course of two years.   The red lights always appeared in a group of three.  They never split away from each other.  They always remained close and seemed to stay in one area of the sky, but at a considerably far distance from me.  Unlike! the orange lights I have seen that separate from one another and venture close to populated areas.   On several occasions I have witnessed all three red lights participate in creating three formations in a particular order.  When the red lights would perform there “formation ritual” the lights were always over the Gulf of Mexico.  They would appear one at a time at first in no particular order.  They were all just close together.  Shortly after appearing the red lights dimmed out reappearing in a vertical line, one at a time, top to bottom.  They would hold this formation for a remainder of less than 5 minutes and again dim out.  Less than 3 minutes later the lights would reappear in a horizontal line, turning on one at a time, left to right.  This formation was held for a remainder of less than 5 minutes until yet again the lights dim out.   Now less than 3 minutes later all three red lights have appeared at the same time in a triangle formation.  Very shortly after the last formatio! n they move in close together still holding there triangle for! mation. They move in towards each other, all three lights connect and then disappear.  Just last night I was able to see an orange orb up close enabling me to better monitor its movements and rule out any speculation of the mysterious orange fire balls as being Chinese lanterns or anything related to such.  These orange orbs I have seen in the sky appear to me as being some source of intelligence.  Whether it be in the form of controlled or just an unexplainable form. These things seem to me to have an agenda. Saturday 08-24-13	  My family and I were traveling east on 696 late in the evening.  It was dark. I looked up into the sky from the passenger window to see a very deep orange colored sphere floating very close.  It was almost as close as the tops of the freeway lights.  We were traveling at 70 mph and the orange sphere traveled with us for about 3 mins appearing in the same spot in my window.   After freaking out and trying to get my husband to look at what I was seeing, when I looked again it was gone.  It really looked like a ball of fire.  It seemed to be about the size of a traffic light.  A standard round traffic light.  08-27-13 It was again late evening my husband and I were in our back yard relaxing by candle light.  I looked to the north and saw one fire ball that began to slowly drift west and eventually dimmed out.  It was over a course of five minutes.  Another fire ball appeared in the same general location as the first, but instead traveled north east and after a few short minutes slowly dimmed out.  We waited around to see another one until eventually my husband urged me to come in.  As I was stepping through the door way of my back door right before I was inside I looked to the north and saw another fire ball. 08-28-13 Last night around the time of 9:30 I asked my husband to join me in our back yard. Unbeknownst to him I wanted to see the orange fire balls again.  After entering our back yard I walked to our patio table to set down the lit citronella candle I was holding.  After doing so I immediately looked to my left (which is north) up to the sky…. …and behold!  My husband and I see an orange fire ball.   We watched it for a duration of at least 8 to 10 minutes.  It appeared in the north and after almost five minutes it got closer and was now about to pass over our house.  While it was still approaching us and getting closer, we noticed tiny red lights blink a couple times in the bottom part of the fire ball.   Then it increased its speed.  When it did this it left a very faint trail of light that almost seemed animated.  I can’t think of a better way to describe it. It was very unusual.  What was even more unusual was when the fire ball began to pass directly over our heads.  It faded from the deep! orange/amber color to a very transparent orange.  It was so transparent that it was almost undetectable.  It looked like the orbs of light that will sometimes appear in still frame pictures.  It was as if the fire ball faded in color because it didn’t want to be detected.  It emitted no sound, debris, smoke, nothing. It was so incredible and strange!  After watching the first fire ball pass over out of sight we again looked north to see another fire ball heading west.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,42.5096,-82.9361

On Thursday 29th of August, we went outside on our 8th floor balcony before going to bed as we always do, about 21:00.  My husband remarked that the stars were bright but that one in particular seemed very bright.  As we looked, the “star” which was bright white, shot straight up and disappeared into the sky.  The object was brighter than Venus and somewhat larger.  It was not lights from an aircraft as the colour and intensity was different, just like a very bright star.  It was about 45 degrees above the horizon and about 15 degrees east of due north. There is virtually nothing to the north of us and the street lights are “low light” which gives us a nice clear view of the stars and aurora when it is visible.  The placement of this “star” caught both of our attention at the same time and we both saw it shoot straight up and disappear at the same time.  We haven’t really seen anything quite like this in this location, although we see high and fast flying aircraft and some curious things from time to time, but this was just very obvious and completely different.

It hovered over the mountain in my line of sight but it was much lower than any normal flight paths.

It moved so quickly that the light left a small pattern in the sky behind it for a split second (probably just my eyes adjusting).

I am writing to report two highly strange phenomena I witnessed in the sky starting at approximately 9:40pm PST. While cleaning my apartment I decided to take a phone call from a friend and went outside to sit on the steps that faced the street in front of my ground level apartment.  Tonight was unlike any other fall night except the sky was crystal clear and neighborhood dogs, both near and far, were both howling eerily and barking.  While talking on the phone and staring at the stars, I observed one tiny orb about the size of a distant star chasing another slightly larger tiny light against the backdrop of a cloudless star filled night sky.  Neither object light looked like aircraft. The points of light were relatively tiny in comparison to planes or other celestial bodies. In addition, the glow from the points of light were cconstant with no recognizable blinking patterns or variations in luminosity.  Given the relatively small specs of a light, they seemed to be higher up in the atmosphere and traveling faster than any recognizable aircraft I’ve ever seen.  Both lights were traveling from North to South at approximately the same speed with no change in distance between the two objects.  Of the two tiny lights, the one on the right trailing the one to the left disappeared abruptly. Shortly after the larger of the two disappeared as well. I told my friend I had just seen something strange. We quickly dismissed it and we went back to talking about our day.  Minutes later, at about 9:45pm PST, I was alarmed to see series or formation of 4-5 bright lights slowly rise from behind the silhouette of the wooded hillside in the distance. The string of 4-5 lights hovered silently without movement for about 35-40 minutes.  I observed the phenomenon from the corner of my residential suburban neighborhood. Confirming later with a compass, the horizontal string of lights was observed at approximately 240 degrees West/ Southwest and about 33 degrees above the horizon in relation to the zenith of the sky.  The light on the right of the horizontal 4-5 light pattern was remarkably brighter than anything I’d ever seen in the sky at night before in my life! Ever!  It was a bright golden orb that did move and stayed locked in formation with the 4 other lights that were evenly spaced out in a horizontal pattern to the left. The lights did not blink, change shape, or alter in brightness. All four to five lights in the formation were larger than planets or starts appear in sky with the bight orange one being larger and brighter than anything I'd ever seen.  The glow from the light on the right was remarkably bright and unique in color and shape. The horizon behind the glowing gold light was a faint blue – similar to the way the night sky appears behind sports stadium lights. The arrangement first appeared to resemble the top-floor of a tall large city skyscraper at night - only with a gold “search light” on the right corner.  I know for a fact there are no buildings on the distant wooded hillside. I could clearly see empty faint blue night sky as negative space above and below the string of bizarre static lights.  I observed the phenomenon from approximately 9:40pm to about 10:20pm PST. During this time the formation of lights did not move in direction, nor did they grow in size, change position, or alter their pattern in relation to each other.  I hung up the phone and took several photos with my iPhone 4G. I called several friends in the county to see if they could confirm the sighting but no one answered. I called my friend in Los Angeles back at which time I continued to discuss what I was witnessing.  With my friend on the phone I stopped a woman walking her dog crossed on the side walk in front of my apartment and pointed to the four lights inquiring if they seemed strange to her. She looked just in time to see the bright orange light suddenly disappear, while the other 3-4 lights remained exactly where they were. Maybe two seconds later, all three smaller light disappeared at once followed by a flash on the horizon. Suddenly and the whole sky went black as if someone had turned out the lights. It was so abrupt that that the woman was spooked and grabbed her dog and trotted off in the direction she was headed. I then called the San Rafael police to report the sighting. They referred me to the local Sheriffs department who then gave me the contact number for the National UFO center. Attached are the series of photos taken with my iPhone 4 with no flash. Moments later, two aircraft with blinking lights were seen flying over the hillside. Nothing has returned to the airspace since. I am perplexed.",2013-10-23T00:00:00,37.99526143250689,-122.52110826446282

Atmospheric conditions allowed me to hear airplanes and cars as normal. Six objects in a loose formation of three pairs traveling at a constant height from SSE to ENE over Arlington TX.   Bright Orange/Red spheres, whose formation changed predictively in relation to my perspective as they flew by.  My view of this sky segment is 25% blocked by trees. Their size, apparent speed, and height reminded me of a formation of military helicopters, which most often travel down the I-30 corridor, as I see these several times a year, both day and night.  This flight appeared 2-3 miles South of I-30.  The two distinctions that differed these from a normal helicopter formation were a complete lack of noise, and their light output. These aircraft were silent, and luckily during my viewing there was no competing airplane noise.  To extrapolate their apparent size and speed to a distance where a normal helicopter could not be heard, would place them near the border of believability. The light output of these objects is, in my opinion, what sets them apart from anything in my experience.  They were not pin points, but were circular and by changing perspective, had volume.  Although orange/red, the brightness was only a little less than if a spotlight were pointed in my direction.  The intensity seen, varied only with distance, it was steady and uniform from all 6 objects.  They were too bright to make out helicopter rotors or tail booms.

The total movement from my point of view was very slight over that time.

No sounds were heard by any of us.  Because we could clearly see jets flying between NY and Atlanta passing above it, I would estimate the height at 5-20K feet, perhaps 3-10 miles distant, which would place it near or above Silver Spring, MD, if any other reports come in.  If interested, I have a picture taken from inside my home using a flash to orient the position in the sky.  The light can be seen through a window even with the flash!",2013-12-05T00:00:00,39.1061,-76.9276

At 6:45 p.m. Eastern time I arrived at the beach overlooking the Gulf of Mexico where I regularly skywatch, just north of the rock jetty at Blind Pass inlet, on the south end of Captiva Island, SW Florida.  The sky was about 30 percent overcast.  There were several aircraft in the area, as is usually the case because of two nearby airports. At 7:15 I noticed a relatively small, deep orange “fireball” traveling horizontally north to south, about 40 degrees above the horizon, and at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet or less, substantially lower than most aircraft in the area.  This object appeared to be of exactly the same size of the one I recently reported in “Sighting #30” and was traveling at least two, maybe 3 times faster than any aircraft I’ve seen.  I first noticed the object when in was straight out in front of me, due west.  It’s size was that of an average size star, whereas most all others I've seen are the size of a pea held at arm’s length, and as bright or brighter than Venus at it’s brightest.  I watched it through my binoculars for around 7 to 10 seconds, when it changed color to a solid white, and then split in two, with the light on the right being up at an angle of around 45 degrees from the one below.  Without binoculars it looked like a single light.

As I was looking up at the stars between throws, I glimpsed what I thought was a shooting star, I gazed back and found it again and realized it was actually an aircraft. I noticed right away that it did not have the typical green and red lights, and nothing was blinking.  I have flown planes so am very familiar with their patterns, speeds, sounds, etc.  This was truly strange because of only the very dim red lights on each side of the aircraft, because of its high rate of speed and because it was absolutely silent. There was no way to tell the size or speed, because I couldn’t really tell what I was looking at, there was absolutely no sound at all.  I can only approximate what I saw. I would estimate that it was traveling above Interstate 5 in a Southern direction at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet above the ground and at a speed of roughly 700 mph.  I would approximate the aircraft to be about 75’ wide, no idea of length…very dark sky. I am a completely sane individual and am just very interested in finding out what the heck it was that I saw.  I am guessing that maybe it is an electric drone practice run..?  but again, nor typical navigation lights. Hope someone out there saw it also, and maybe has an answer for me.

We heard a loud noise that sort of sounded like a jet.  But it went on so long that I started looking for it.  Then, to me, it started sounding more like a rocket.  I looked in the direction of the Kennedy space center as I often watch launches from there.  And there was indeed what looked like a rocket.  I enjoy trying to catch the take offs from my area when the weather is nice.  So I am usually familiar with what is taking off when because I try to watch for them.  (And sometimes photograph them)  I remembered that SpaceX had tried to take off early in the week and had been delayed but I thought it took off that night before on Dec. 3.    When I got home I did searches and could NOT find anything about any launches at Kennedy. I also checked the schedule of launches from Kennedy and other than one later this month there was nothing scheduled after the Dec. 3 SpaceX launch that had happened the night prio! r.  So after lots of digging I have yet to find anything about this launch.  My guess is it's unpublished NASA launch of a spy satellite or something.  But it definitely was a rocket launch and looked very much like it would if it were from Kennedy Space center. Also immediately after there seemed to be a lot of activity at the NAS Jax. (Tons of military jet planes) The area I was in 32256 is very close to the NAS base (just across the river from it), however, the ""launch"" was coming from the coast in the South eastern direction.  Again this is the exact direction I have previously watched many NASA launches. I did find, after lots of digging this video-http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgRzshn_8QI&list=FLgk_WMPAW3xQhP2N9OtTnMA&index=1 .  It sounds and looks just like the launch I witnessed.

She was eating oatmeal and she came upstairs and was frightened by the site.  Then I called up my husband to see these lights.  I then noticed another 4 or 5 orange lights w! ere going at the same altitude, heading north to south.  These lights approached from my left, from the north.  I left my husband upstairs, calmed down my daughter, who went back to her Ipad, and I grabbed my Ipod to take what video I could, knowing it would not turn out great because it is an Ipod.  I keep the Ipod on my body all day because I am tracking my steps with the goal of 12,000 steps a day. I took the video, though I moved some and also attempted to zoom in.

They seemed to fade away as they went south.  They were moving as quickly as a helicopter would, or even an airplane.  They were not zooming, but keeping a steady pace but with obvious movement.  I did not sense fear, but more curiosity.  I did not feel the urge to run outside. We live on the very edge of a large residential community, so possibly they were following along the edge of darkness?  A country road borders our neighborhood just a street away from the direction where I saw these lights. When I called my daughter and husband up to see them, the dog came too.  The dog is afraid of helicopters, last summer a helicopter was hovering about 100 feet above our residential street trying to find a car crash that was a few miles away.  The dog showed no signs of fear or unusual behavior. I will add that I was not wearing my glasses which are used for distance.  I only use them for driving, some television, and to watch live shows.",2013-12-02T00:00:00,,

When I looked I did not see what he was referring to.  However, as we stood outside several minutes later I witnessed first hand a formation of rapidly moving ""white"" lights, moving from a north to south general direction.  When I observed the lights it appeared that at first, they were in a pointed formation similar to a chevron, however as they moved, the lights were moving in and out of formation randomly.  For example, some of the lights moved ahead of the others periodically, and then back, as others did the opposite.  There were approximately 10 or 12 of these lights in this particular instance.  Our viewing angle was approximately 120 to 150 degrees from where we were standing to the objects in question.  Approximately 5 minutes later, a third set of lights was seen, a! lso traveling the same trajectory as the previously mentioned.  However, there were only about 5 of the lights in this occurrence.  These particular lights were moving very rapidly as well, but in more of a ""line"" formation, semi-diagonal in nature from a north to south direction.  These particular lights did not appear to move out of formation as the aforementioned.  About 10 minutes later, myself and one of the two witnessing coworkers made a fourth observance of these lights, this time there were four lights in total.  The lights were much brighter this time, and coming from a more eastern direction heading west, south-west.  These four lights were packed much closer together, and weaving in and out of their formation rapidly.  As they approached our position, they changed course to a more southern direction very rapidly.  Each visual lasted approx. one minute, with the last one lasting slightly longer.

They were oval shaped and a little fuzzy, and it looked like there were about seven total in a formation.  What struck me was that they were glowing orange.  I live near an airport and these were not commercial planes.  They made no sound and left no trails in the air.  My first thought was that they were Chinese floating lanterns.  It was at this point I noticed they picked up speed (they had been sort of slowly meandering) and I rushed to park and get a better view.  The experience up to this point had been about three minutes.  It took me 30 seconds to park and I never stopped keeping tabs on them. At this point I mentioned to my companion, who had been seeing all of this and was confused also, that they were picking up speed.  I also noticed two other cars slowing down to point and look.  I ran under a tree and into open grass to get a better look.  There was NOTHING in the sky, other than stars, the moon and a few commercial planes.  I looked in the direction they were heading, and then frantically in every other direction from every angle, and saw no sign of them.  I don't really believe in aliens, but a UFO is not defined by being piloted by an extraterrestrial.  I do know that it was very out of the ordinary, very strange, and very unsettling.

Ive been around the service and this didnt seem to be chopper s nor planes we went just to pick the kids up from friends church friends. I view myself as an active observer ! of the skys this is another of only a hand full that I cant figure out .and all the year's ive seen stuff this one has led me here.

I realized that it was moving—in my direction, on a southwest to northeasterly path at a steady speed.  As it came closer, I could tell it was in the sky, though low and the “fire” became red.   I then thought it must be a helicopter and I was seeing its red light, though it was not flashing.  I waited to see the green light, or to hear the sound of the blades.   It was traveling at a speed similar to a helicopter.  It ended up passing overhead at a low altitude and there was never a sound—not from propellers and not from an engine.   While overhead it appeared to be a light at the bottom of a triangular shaped object, ! but that could have been the radiating beams of light that created an illusion.

The rear set was a read glow which was considering the height about ½ mile to 1 mile behind the first set.  It became apparent the this was one solid object.  I could not make out the center section but could see that it was a more dense area the night sky.  It was moving slowly at maybe 500-600 ft off the ground.  There was absolutely no navigation lights of any kind. There were no lights visible between the front to the back.  When the object got where I could see the rear end, It had steady small white and what looked like blue on both sided in a vertical fashion.  In the center was a very large read glowing light.!

So I quickly called my mom and step-dad out to witness it too.  It was a small blue orb-like light that appeared, streaked across the sky, then disappeared...and then appeared again.  It seemed to be flying around in circles, but in a sporadic flight pattern accelerating and decelerating and changing directions much faster than any modern military aircraft could do. It would appear, fly a looping, zig-zag pattern for a few seconds then disappear, only to appear again a few moments later.  It wasn't a spotlight because it was a little orb and I would have been able to see the beam of light.  There were possibly more than one because at one point my Mom saw two fly right by each other then split off in different directions, and I saw one with a red flashing light on it and then one without so there could have been multiple orbs.  It wasn't an airplane either because there wasn't a flashing white light and they flew very differently than a jet.  It seemed like there was only one, then more started popping up and then just like that they were gone.  Also, before they completely disappeared they seemed to be flying around at altitude then diving at the ground at steep angles and very rapid speeds, almost like a dive-bomber would.

I was making sure that my car was locked before going in the house, When I noticed a light moving slowly,silently in the dark sky toward my direction,It looked like a circle with what it seemed to be a bright red and bright yellow, like a fire contained with in the circle,  There was no blinking,just a bright red mixture of fire like mixture all contained with in the circle,there was no smoke,no sound,just a slow moving object at a very low altitude {about a 3/4 of a mile high}, As I was observing this craft move and pass almost over me,I situated myself as close to the house wall as possible as to pretend to be part of the house,not moving.As the first craft was gliding over me at the described altitude ,I noticed a second craft also coming from the same direction{from the West m! oving East},  The separating distance from the first craft I calculate to be about 4 city blocks,This craft was also identical in description{If you have seen in you tube a video of the functioning sun and all the hot colors,That is exactly how these crafts looked inside that circle},  The speed of the second craft was similar to the one of the first craft,As the second craft was passing over us{same altitude},I noticed 2 crafts coming from the same direction about 4 city blocks separating distance,These 2 crafts were flying side by side{somewhat close to each other}.  Needless to say by now I was very scared,and planning to get myself into the house asap.I went into the house and told my wife what I saw and ask her to come to the front porch of the house,By this time there were two more crafts coming from the same direction at somewhat faster pace{still I feel that it was slow speed for a UFO}but I felt that these two crafts were in a little faster pace , perhaps trying to catch! up  to the first four crafts.My wife saw these two crafts and! she als o could not figure out what  they were{We are absolutely sure that they were not airplane,helicopters or anything man made.as  me and my wife were looking at the two crafts,I noticed 2 more crafts coming from the same direction in the distance{4 city blocks}By now I called my next door neighbor and told him to come out and see what was going on outside,He came out and had a cell phone{Iphone5}and was able to still catch  some seconds of video of the crafts as they seemed to gather high in the Eastern sky.

I grabbed my 12x binoculars to look at the moon and immediately upon taking my binoculars away from my eyes an incredibly bright white light was generally pointed directly at me, and sometimes varying direction randomly as a manually operated spotlight does..  This light was between 50,000 and 100,000 feet in altitude, just below and to the right of the moon from my perspective, and varying in intensity while still being directed at my precise position.  I was looking generally ESE.  Over the course of 5-10 minutes, I followed the object as it descended from approximately 60 degrees above the horizon to approximately 20 degrees.  During this descent, it paused a few times in a stationary position in relation to the power lines behind my house.  It did not create any contrails nor did it have a debris trail.  It was clearly above contrails from actu! al jets passing through the area at the time.  When the light wasn't pointed directly at me, I could see some type of round shape.  My wife also witnesses this object and said she saw two extruding portions of the shape.  I would estimate that this object was 10-25 miles away from me, based on the amount of haze between me and the object.  Passing jets were far less hazy through my binoculars.  I work as a professional technician with lighting and video.  I would estimate the color temperature of the light as 5600K (It did not match the color temperature of the sunlight reflecting off aircraft in the area).  It was about as bright as a Super Trooper concert spotlight from 500 feet away on its tightest focus.  Anyone who has sat on the floor of a stadium concert and been in the beam of a follow spot should understand this analogy.  I saw no standard aircraft navigation lights.  I have watched satellites fly overhead many times in my lifetime, and I have never seen one during daylight.  I have never seen a satellite linger in the same area of the sky, pause its movement, and vary its direction of movement.  I have also never seen a satellite or high altitude aircraft move so slowly.  At one point while the beam was directed at me I felt a warming sensation in my abdomen.  The encounter ended with the light turning off suddenly and the object fading from view in about 250 milliseconds.",2013-06-02T00:00:00,39.5539,-104.9694

This craft was followed by another craft that looked the same.  They flew slightly faster than an airplane and at a lower altitude.   When these two flew out of sight, another red light appeared from over the west hills followed by another one at the same distance as the first two flying in a similar direction although slightly lower in altitude and more south in their direction but still flying southeast.   There seemed to be a low sound but it was hard to hear because we were standing right near the 405 freeway in between Salmon and Taylor St.  It was difficult to tell how large the objects were but they seemed to be around the size of a small plane.  They were bright red and seemed to pulse at a rate close to human heart beat so the light was emitted constantly.

This evening as my husband and I were driving west on Broad Street, I observed about 8 orange lights in the southern sky.  They appeared at first to look like maybe chinese lanterns as they were floating from the horizon up and eastward toward Columbus.  They appeared to be fairly close, like they may have been released from the Battelle Darby Metro Park a few miles south of Broad Street.  I continued to watch as I had never seen any lights like this.  I wondered if they might have been a new type of firework as this is July 4th weekend and a lot of folks were letting off private fireworks in the area.  These lights didn't extinguish like I would have expected however.   I turned south on Murnan Road and lost sight of them because of some trees.  When I caught sight of them again, they appeared to be over the city of Columbus maybe 10 miles away.   Both my husband and I were surprised by the distance they covered.  We continued to watch as I tried to follow in the car.   From Murnan, I turned north on Alton, east on Hall, south on Galloway, and then east on Alkire.  Our view was obscured by trees during a good bit of this drive, but by the time we got to the golf course we then saw 4 bright white lights above the Grove City suburb just southwast of the city of Columbus.  These may or may not have been related to the 8 orange lights we viewed a bit earlier.   I pulled over into the back of the firehouse parking lot to get a better view.  These 4 lights did some unexpected things--on occasion one or more would fade out and then illuminate again, the lights would move around a bit, combine and then break apart.   There would be 4 then 2 then 3 then 4 again until eventually they all combined into one very bright white light which kind of blinked out.   During this time we both attempted to film with our iPhones but just couldn't get ! it together before the lights were gone.  They were absolutely! mesmerzing like I couldn't take my eyes off them.  We waited awhile, ready to film but they didn't come back- until later that is... At approximately 1020 pm, I was on my deck watching the sky when one orange light, just like the original 8 we  saw earlier this evening, came up from the west horizon and floated up and eastbound, more toward Hilliard, a suburb northwest of Columbus.   This was followed by a second orange light maybe 20 seconds later and following about the same path as the first.  These both faded as they went upward as if they were going into the clouds. This evening was partly cloudy, it had rained earlier in the day.  The temperature was around 76 degrees.  There were a lot of private fireworks going off as this is the weekend following the 4th of July.   Our first sighting was at dusk and the second was dark.   This is an area that is northeast of Wright Patterson AFB.  We also have Rickenbacher close to the sighting area- it was a former AFB.",2013-07-14T00:00:00,40.0034168732507,-82.99822087165134

My husband, our son, my brother, and I were at the South Drive-In Theater in Columbus, Ohio, on Saturday, July 6, 2013, about to watch a movie around 9:20pm when over in the southern sky, under the clouds, we saw four round white lights in the sky.   We were facing west towards screen 1.  The sun had already set in the west but there was still a sliver of light in the western sky. These four lights were in lateral wavy line.  Then they moved into a triangle formation.  Each of the three round lights were at each point of the triangle and the fourth went to the left of the triangle and it's light went out.  They were in the triangle formation for about 5-10 seconds.   Then they went into a straight vertical line along with the fourth joining the three, which the fourth lit back up to get into formation.  They were in that pattern for about 10-15 seconds.   Then they dispersed from the pattern laterally from one another, however staying relatively close to each other.   All four of them started to descend in altitude until we could see them no more due to the tree line.   The whole duration was approximately 3-4 minutes.  We could tell these lights were several miles away and that they flew with a purpose, not a random act.  They flew at a leisurely pace.  I knew they were not fireworks and they were not planes.  There were people shooting off fireworks on the other side of the South Drive-In Theater.  There was also a commercial jet flying to the southwest of the four UFO's, heading southeast during the time the four lights were in the sky.  Afterward, there were two helicopters that flew over to where the four UFO's had been.  The helicopters seem to be searching for while.  They searched for approximately 10 minutes or so.  Although, we did not pay much attention to the helicopters after that.  I've never seen anything like this before.  All four of us saw them.  A lady in a car next to us was recording them with her cell phone after I pointed them out.  I hope she puts the video on YouTube.  I did not have anything to video record the four lights unfortunately.",2013-07-14T00:00:00,40.0034168732507,-82.99822087165134

The object followed the shoreline from the east (North Myrtle) and flew to my right (west) towards Myrtle Beach.  With the night being clear I was able to track it for at least 15 miles.  It traveled at a constant altitude until it got about 12-15 miles away (Myrtle Beach) and then appeared to ascend, disappearing into a light cloud cover/haze.

The following is a more complete description, with links to all 4 videos, but the originals are too large to attach here.  Feel free to append this to, or replace the original report. 11/9/13  Inverness, Florida   I saw approximately 10 bright orange objects passing from east to west, somewhat south of my location (Lat 28.8731 N  Long 82.3606 W).  All of the clips are really dark (sorry, shot at night), so they are best viewed full-screen, on a large monitor.  It will also help if the room is dark.   I recorded a total of 4 videos, some, when viewed in the original format, display terrestrial reference points. However, video enhancement would probably show trees, and such, on all of the clips.  Each video is of different objects, with some clips showing multiple objects at the same time. Each video was shot using a Nokia 928 cellphone, with an 8MP camera.  They are all recorded at 1920x1080 resolution, at 30FPS.  The file names show the dates and times that each was recorded.  The earliest recording started at 19:44:56 EST, and the last started at 19:49:28 EST.  The cellphone was held in the vertical position (long side from top to bottom), so when viewed in a video player, the clips may appear sideways.  If viewed sideways, east will be at the bottom of the screen, and the top of the original clip will be to the left side of your screen. The objects did not pass all at the same time, in any sort of ""formation"".  They passed during a couple minute period, at somewhat varying separations, and they seemed to vary in distance, but they all did appear to be tracking on parallel courses.  To the naked eye, the objects were a fairly bright yellow-orange, and the general appearance did not appear to change with the viewing angle.  It looked the same approaching (from the east), when they were  even with me (looking directly south) and departing (to the west).  The trajectory of every object was straight, there were no sharp turns, or zig-zags.  Any perceived movements of that sort, in the videos, were due to my inability to hold the cellphone steady.  Where the objects appear to stay in one place, ""hovering"", this is due to me doing a better job of panning with it, All objects continued moving at a steady pace, and did not stop. 19:44:56  This video shows at least 3 objects.  The bright white light is the moon,  At some point, near the end, my neighbor's porch is seen. 19:46:20  This video shows one object, passing over the roof line of the neighboring apartment.  The light colored area, near the top, at the start of the clip, is the eave of my apartment. The lighted area is on the neighbor's porch, the bright white light, in the upper left, near the end, is the moon. 19:48:36  This clip has no obvious points of reference, and also displays ""streaking"".  The movement is due to me moving the cellphone, not amazing maneuvers.  I tried to pan with the object, as it crossed the sky, but that is not apparent. 19:49:28  This one shows a single object.  It appears that I was fairly successful at keeping it centered, as it moved.  The object was definitely moving, from east to west, and fairly quickly. There was no apparent sound, associated with their passage, nor any debris tails (like with meteors or space junk burning up). There were multiple witnesses to the event.  I was with someone, and I also heard other nearby voices, in the area, making statements about what was seen. As suggested, I have uploaded all 4, uncompressed videos to the links shown below.  I am uncertain if YouTube does any processing or compression, after they get them.  I have the originals on my phone, and on a PC. http://youtu.be/JPWowF2ZqBg  http://youtu.be/b_0uKoymZRo   http://youtu.be/WsK0nm8ml5Q  http://youtu.be/Ts67a3H8dKo",2013-11-11T00:00:00,28.83243978494624,-82.30318279569893

On Sunday June 30th 2013. I went to a gas station in the Holiday Park section of Plum right by the McDonalds.   I grabbed my usual pack of smokes and a tea.  Nothing seemed unusual about this night (unlike other times I've spotted UFO's).  Well I decided to drive through Holiday Park to smoke my ciggarette, while driving down O'Block a bright fire like object caught my eye in the sky.   Naturaly with seeing UFO's on more than one occasion I knew immediately I needed to get to a higher ground for better view (I was in a valley surrounded by trees).  Luckily to my advantage right next to me was the entrance to Larry Mills Park, the highest point in this neighborhood.   As I was working my way up the hill I kept checking my mirror to see if the object was still there.  I lost sight on it for a moment and thought it was gone.  As I got to the top I put my car in park and checked the mirror and to my surprise it was still hovering there.  I got out of my car and when turned around to face the object to my surprise not only was the light still there, but two others accompanied it.  They sat still, and motionless in the sky, not making a noise.  I quickly leaned into my vehicle to retrieve my phone and I stated recording the events.  About 5 seconds after I stated recording the light up highest quickly dimmed and disappeared.  Than about 10 seconds later the middle light did the same, with another passing 10 seconds the farthest left one dimmed, slightly glided to the right, and went black, and they were gone.  On the video it is not very clear because of a bad lighting situation at the park, BUT I did manage to snap a still image from the video and enhance the brightness and contrast and you can see the objects half decently. I know this is a very bad short description but I felt it needed reported.  I know it clearly says do not post private info but if anyone else saw this object that night, which I know 3 others report! ed it, please contact my UFO email ((e-address deleted)) with info on what you saw!

This is to submit an incident report by myself and my wife last night (approximately 11:00 PM, June 30th, 2013) in Victoria BC , Canada. My family and myself were having a BBQ , then later an open fire pit in our backyard when this incident happened. My wife and myself were siting facing south when we spotted 3 bright stars (lights possibly, we compared the stars/lights to the brightest planet we saw that night and they were a little bit brighter but not twinkling).  The 3 lights were in a triangle with one of the pointed ends facing down towards the earth.  Then all 3 lights (in complete unison) started moving slowly towards the sky, they then slowly faded out and disappeared.   From where we were siting, the triangle of lights were in the sky starting at about 25 degrees , then rose to about just under 40 degrees before disappearing.  The size of the triangle was approximately the equivalent of at least 5-6 full moons in the night sky (it was fairly large). This happened at about 11:00PM on June 30th, 2013 and lasted for just under 1 minute. I have a wife and 2 children and run and Information Technology company here in Victoria.

It was moving very very slowly north, we could barely confirm its movement; that's how slow it was.  The large light itself would e very large if it was a physical object.  The way it flashed those little light was very strange, it was like it was taking picture or trying to get our attention.

They had  a cat cornered in the yard.  So, I put them in the house and went back out to check on the cat.  I heard a noise coming from over towards the west side of the house (I live out in the country and the neighbors on that side are out of site from the front of the house).  I stepped away from the house and looked over there just in time to see the first object before it went behind my house  and behind my tree line.  It was a dull dark color and I didn't see any lights on that one, but it had a slight illumination.  A couple of seconds later another one comes by following the same path.  It was also dark colored but it had one red light and one blue light on the back.  One on top the other on the bottom, I think. Then it was out of site, too. I went over to the other side of the house to see if I could see them but all I could see were the lights from the second one through the trees. They were very, very low.  I half expected to hear a big crash.  It sounded like only one combined sound. It sounded like a very muted jet engine, kinda like a whine. I have seen jets (not this low!), crop dusters, helicopters and even military copters around here over the years and this isn't any of those.  However, this is the third time I've had something fly over really low, always in pairs. The first time was April 27, 2011, again it was late.  It was getting ready to storm and I was on my porch talking on the phone with my sister, (Bad storms scare us and I'm the family alert system if there may be tornadoes).  I was facing west when I heard something and turned towards the east.  It was right there over my side yard heading right over my porch. It was maybe 30-40 ft. away when I heard it.  I said the impolite version of ""OH, SHOOT!""   My sister thought something was happening weather wise and shes trying to ask me whats going on.  She said it sounded like heavy wind and rain to her. It was the same sound as those last night, a kind of whine, like a very muted jet engine.  It was just a few seconds and it was over me.  It was so low that I think if I were standing on top of the house I could've about touched it.  I really thought it was going to crash into my house.  I didn't see any lights but it was slightly illuminated.  Then a second one was flying! over my barn in the field in front of my house.  Again it only seemed like one sound but I don't know if only one was making noise or if it just seemed to run together. The first one I saw pretty clear, if very quickly.  It was maybe 30 ft. wide and  rounded on the front. There was a slight dome on top.  I would've said it looked like the movie type flying saucer if I had only seen the front, but then the sides kinda rounded to a point in the back. As it was going over me is when I noticed the second one over the barn, so that took my attention for a second.  When I looked back towards the west (they were flying east to west) it was about to the tree line on the other side of that neighbors yard.  I saw the back for just a second.  I think the first one had a single, wide white light coming out the back but it seemed more like it was from an engine than a light.  I can't say much about the second one, the first one took most of my attention.  They were flying really close together and extremely low. The next day (28th) the capacitor went out on our well and the following night (29th) the capacitor went out on our central heat and air unit.  Also, about a month later my husband went to turn on the window unit in the tack room of the barn and it wouldn't work either.  So, if it's some kind of government thing I wish they'd refund me the $400 plus it cost us! And that they would quit flying so low. The second time was in late April 2012. I'm not sure of the date and I didn't really get a look at them.  I was in the house and I heard them go over the back side of the house.  Again roughly east to west and very low, right over the tree line.  I ran out the front and just caught a glimpse of the back lights or whatever they are. I don't know what they are.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,31.8491,-83.7336

There was a flock of geese flying east in a typical “V” formation.  A white object was approaching the formation from the west and below at an angle of approximately 45°.  At first I thought it might be another goose joining the formation, but I’ve never seen a “white goose” so I thought that it could be a seagull.   As I tried to get a better look at it, I couldn’t distinguish any appendages such as wings or head, it appeared to be spherical in shape with what looked like a mirror sort of reflection flashing randomly, nothing like a wing with regular features or motion.  Its size appeared to be similar to a goose or seagull. As the object started to get close to the geese, their formation became erratic and the typical “V” became chaotic while it appeared that they were trying to regroup but were unable to.  The white object reached a point close to the geese–with the direction of the flock being east and referring to the direction of flight as 12:00, the white object stayed at approximately an 8:00 position close to the group, but not inside, now moving as if it were part of the group. I was trying to adjust my vision to see the white object as a bird considering that my eyes were, “playing tricks” with my perception, but I just couldn’t see anything but a sphere.    After a minute or so, the entire flock including the white sphere “disappeared”.   There were no obstructions or clouds to block my vision, but I moved around to different positions to try to get a different perspective because at this point I wasn’t really considering something unusual happening.  What really held my attention was the thought that I was seeing some sort of albino goose.   It took a few minutes after the flock of geese disappeared that it struck me that something more unusual was going on. There were no unusual sounds or other objects, no aircraft of any type were in the area from my perspective.  The sky was clear with high visibility.  Only the geese and the white object were seen.  The approximate location was: 34° 17’ 39” N, 118° 41’ 42” W (from Google Earth). Unknown Altitude. I really don’t want to jump to any conclusions.  I’m sure that there may be an explanation that just hasn’t occurred to me. Thank you for your time and interest.

Yesterday around 11:30 to 11:33pm Eastern time, I was taking my dog out in my backyard and looking at the sky since it was unusually clear.  While looking at some stars I noticed slightly dimmer lights (yellowish-white) in a V-shaped formation moving across the sky.  I quickly reached for my iPhone in my pocket, looked down to pull up the camera, but by the time I was ready to take a picture, the object was passing over some trees. I did not have the time to count the amount of lights but I would approximate there were about a little over a dozen.  They were about the size of the stars-that is, they were tiny lights, not large.  These yellowish-white lights did not flicker or blink and were very close together, about six or seven forming each arm of the V-shape.  Since the sky was very clear and dark, I could not make out an actual shape of the aircraft aside from the shape the lights made.  The V-shape was neither too wide nor too narrow.  It was shaped like a normal ""V"". The aircraft was silent, but massive.  If you stretch out your arm and separate your thumb and pointer fingers by about 2.5 to 3 inches, you will get a pretty good idea of how large it was. It moved very quickly across the sky in a linear path, meaning it wasn't zigzagging around.  I pulled up the compass on my phone to see exactly what direction it was heading in-it was heading around 150 degrees southeast, and coming from the north or northwest direction.

I literally put my flashers on and got out of the car to look because I then thought it was a plane that caught fire that was descending rapidly.

I was leaning out my door calling my dogs in when something caught my eye above me to the west. I saw a triangular object moving from south to north.  It didnt have any lights and was absolutely silent.   I didnt have any lights on in my house or outside but could see it because there is a park and baseball field about 200 yards away to the south of my house.  The lights at the baseball field light up the sky very well at night and i could see the underside of the craft.  It appeared metalic by the way the light reflected off of it.  It's hard to say the size of the craft.  It was flying low enough to reflect the light from the ball fields so i cant imagine it being any higher than a 300 hundred feet above and it appeared fairly large at that distance.

This was witnessed by one of my employees and his wife while my employee was working the graveyard shift last night. At approximately 0400 US central time, my employee walked outside of the plant for a security check.  He observed due east of our location a pulsating light in the sky that at first appeared to be a star or planet.  From his perspective it was about the same size as a bright star or planet like Venus, but again, the light was pulsating from relatively dim to bright, back to dim then back to bright, etc.  The apparent altitude was about two fingers' width above the horizon. After he had been watching it for about 20 minutes off and on (he was in and out of the plant checking operations) his wife arrived to bring him some food while on her way to work.  This was at about 0430.  They were both watching it when she spotted a second almost identical pulsating light that he hadn't previously seen move from the north side of the original object to its south side. After the second object moved to the south side of the first object, the first object started to move higher into the sky, as though gaining altitude without moving in any other direction, forward, backward, or sideways.  He started thinking that the lights may have been helicopters, but he had the further impression that if they had been helos they were close enough that he could've heard their engine or rotor noise. After the first object increased its altitude about two to three times what it had been previously, it became stationary.  The one that had moved south of it was stationary the whole time the first object was moving.  After the first object once again became stationary for a few minutes, the second object to the south slowly descended until it was no longer visible above the horizon.  It was not seen again. Several minutes after the second object disappeared below the horizon, the first object started moving slowly to the south, gradually gaining speed until reaching an apparent speed comparable to what is observed of a jet aircraft at high altitude.  Within 30-45 seconds the object was no longer visible, having passed the southern horizon. Total time of observance was about 45 minutes to one hour.  During the entire time there was no discernible sound coming from either object.  Background noise from the plant was minimal.

I saw a bright blue ""orb"" that was much larger than a plane.   It was as bright, or brighter, than a star/planet, but the only way to describe the colour would be ""LED blue.""  It also appeared to have this ""spot"" on it that was pink or red, but i wouldnt call it a ""light"" (like the lights on planes) it just appeared to be part of the colour...it didn't blink.  It caught my attention and I stopped and looked at it, while telling the person on the phone all about it. I'm not someone who is ""into"" UFO stuff.  I'm describing everything I'm seeing to him and he says take a video, I try to but you cant take a video and talk at the same time (iphone.)  I thought it would go away or that maybe it was a star or planet, but when it started bobbing I had to hang up on the friend to shoot the video.  2 people behind me were walking on the sidewalk ! and also looked up at it.  They kept looking up at it as they walked away, but they didnt speak to me and just kept walking and looking back at it.  I cant estimate the distance because I am really bad with that, but you can tell by the size and distance of the plane that passes by on the video that it is very high up and much larger than the plane.  When i started taking the video it appeared stationary.  Although it was bright blue to my eye it showed up bright white on the camera, although some shots when it moves show it blue.  Anyway, it was just hovering very high in the air.  I can't say it was ""in any directio.""   but I was facing south.   Then a plane travelled across the sky (from west to east) and below it (I couldn't see the plane's entire path because a house blocked the view at that point).  But, it started to move subtly when the plane went under.   Then it bobbed a bit and dropped and then quickly ""zoomed"" off in a westerly direction.  The same speed as watching a satellite against stars.   I ran around the corner! to the street behind the house to try and see it, facing west.  There were so many trees but this time it showed up blue on the video too.  It appeared to sort of bob or ""float down,"" faster than before and then drop out of view.   I ran around to the park to see if i could find it again, but it was gone or my view was blocked by all the houses and trees.  Never saw anything after that.  When i went home and watched the videos I noticed that when I thought it was stationary it was actually slowly moving at times.   Moving and stopping.  Fast and slow at the same time if that makes sense.

At first I assumed the light was part of the fireworks that had been taking place off and on throughout our ride, but just a minute or so later, we rounded a curve to find the light was directly in front of us just below a low cloud cover.  The strangeness of what we saw stopped us both in our tracks, literally. At first it appeared to be stationary and at an altitude of about 3000 – 5000 feet.  There was absolutely no sound coming from the object whatsoever throughout our observation.   As we continued to observe, the craft made its way toward us in a westward direction at what appeared to be a steady altitude.  The speed appeared to be about that of single engine plane.  As it passed directly overhead it was obvious that the object was illuminated unlike any airplane we’ve ever observed.  The lights appeared to be arranged in a circular pattern, were pulsating rather than blinking, and were predominantly red and either yellow or orange.   What we observed definitely was not typical of airplane running lights.  We were unable to make out a shape other than the circular appearance of the lights, and there was no unusual motion – just a steady westward track.   We were able to observe the object for about five minutes before it disappeared in the distance.  We estimate that the craft would have flown just south of the Bowling Green airport as it headed westward. In summary, what we saw was unusual enough that we both felt it important to report our observations.   The complete lack of sound at such a low altitude and the color and circular arrangement of the lights were unlike anything either of us had ever seen before.",2013-07-14T00:00:00,37.0327077294686,-86.41964444444444

I have seen many planes, helicopters, meteors and satellites.  Even zig-zagging points of light high up that I can only assume were meteors, as I have read that meteors can zig-zag.  I have never seen anything like this.  It was very surprising.   Looking east from Tumwater, WA, west of I-5 looking towards the Olympia airport about 25 degrees up from the horizon, I saw a bright flash followed immediately by another bright flash and then nothing.  If it was a meteor it was extremely bright, as I was watching this through my regular vision, without the binoculars or the NV.   As there was no streak, it would have had to been directly at me if it were a meteor, and based on the brightness, I would assume it would have lasted longer than the second that it took to make two flashes that bright.   Immediately afterward, I grabbed! my NV and there was nothing in the sky.   There was no sound associated with this flash, and no sound following.   I can't say I saw anything beyond just the flash, but it was definitely interesting.   I am very skeptical by nature, I would not have written this report unless it was something that I felt I couldn't explain.

I suppose it could have been that, but every website I can find that has satellite tracking says there was nothing in that direction, nor at that time.  I just thought that was interesting, and should be noted on the report.   It was two bright flashes, the animation on wikipedia under Satellite flares does not look like what I saw.   Thanks!

I usually look out as I am driving and check out the night sky, so seeing something like this was an unusual sight.  They were very far apart and at four different heights.  I arrived at my house and looked outside to see they had moved.  The lights seemed to get brighter and dimmer as I viewed them but sporadically like burning orbs.  They made no sound. The lights began to hover and move towards each other. They flickered out and disappeared for five minutes and then mysteriously came into view as quickly as they disappeared.   The four orbs hovered for two minutes and then came close together and made a “Z” like formation.  They then moved into a “V” formation and hovered upwards a bit.  They flickered out of view after about three minutes of there reappearance. I made my family come out and watch the orbs with me; there were five of us who witnessed this in total. Something I really want to emphasize is they were hovering.  It did not move like an airplane, balloon, or anything I had seen before.  They were four glowing balls of light that had the control to stay in one place or hover whenever they chose as well as maneuver into different formations….  As of now I have no explanation of what they could have possibly been.  I have never seen such a thing in my life.

When it appeared it looked as if it was a huge shooting star but couldn't have been because after I seen the big bright light that it flashed it disappeared that's when I told my boyfriend and when he looked up he saw it brighten up again right  when it was passing the tree that I had seen it above.

One person thought the shape looked like the ''Underarmor'' clothing logo.  It traversed the clear, windless night sky in about 45 seconds.  No flames, tail, material falling off or smoke was observed.  Not certain if it appeared a bit smaller when it passed out of sight beyond the SE end of the lake.  When it got to the SE end of the lake it seemed to fade- I thought the color went a bit light yellow or white. There was absolutely no sound, no navigation lights and no change in direction. It appeared to move much more slowly than a meteor and much faster than a plane, satellite, space station (we have spotted that years ago).  It's size is hard to explain but it appeared to be about 20+ times larger than the largest star in the sky that night.  No way to describe its position since its size would affect its perceived location. I reported it to the Provincial Police- not because it was unusual but in case it was a manned vehicle and if it encountered engine failure the occupant(s) may crash land.

August 31st 2013 it was a Saturday night, my family had dinner on the deck.  We had the bug zapper on and I forgot to turn it off. I walked out onto the deck at approx 10:05pm CST to unplug the bug zapper.  After I unplugged it and started walking back towards the door I looked up in the sky to admire its beauty as I always do.  I am constantly looking in the night sky and an amateur astronomer. Coming from the north east at a very high altitude I saw a huge light. I have a feeling many people saw this it was huge in terms of normal objects in the night sky.  If you were to extend your arm towards the night sky with your thumb up it would be the size of your thumbnail. It didn't have a finite shape on the outside. It was almost flaring. My initial reaction was cool, ISS must be passing over and the sun is reflecting off it. Something I have seen in the past and verified using the heavens above database.  However I quickly realized the colors were off.  It wasn't just a white bright reflecting type color and it was a lot larger. It was yellowish/white in the center and yellowish/orange on the outsides. It was like it was on fire.  The tips of the light coming off it were pointy. It was almost sparkling without the movement. The white light in the center was almost tear drop shaped with the point in the front heading in my direction.  I ran into the house and grabbed my wife who was asleep on the couch she ran out to look at it. We both witnessed it. I asked her to keep watching it while I ran in to get my binoculars. When I got back on the deck she said it’s almost gone it’s dimming down.  She said it never changed speed. I could still see it and now it looked more like a star moving like normal satellites looks.  However through the binoculars (celestron skymaster 15x70) I could see two star light objects moving.  One was white about the brightness of an average star and next to it was a constant red light of the same brightness. The object never sped up or slowed down.  It’s speed was constant and it was silent. We both had the feeling it was silent because it was so high up.  From first site the object came from the north east and continued in a straight path towards south west until it was literally directly over our house then it sort of banked to the south east towards downtown Chicago.",2013-09-09T00:00:00,42.3677,-88.1497

I was on my balcony smoking a cigarette watching the sky, it was around 8pm and I was looking at the orange-ish hue the sky was giving off. When I first saw the object, I noticed it because it passed in front of a red trail that a plane had left in the sky, making the black object stand out. When I looked to see exactly what it was, though, I couldn't make out any specific shape. It looked like a tiny black ball in the sky hovering around randomly, changing direction but moving slowly. It seemed to float like maybe a group of balloons tied together would if being pushed by the wind, but with the amount of altitude and directional changes, it seemed to be too active to be balloons. After staring at the object for about 45 seconds, I ran inside, grabbed my camera, attached the zoom lens as fast as I could, and hurried back to take as many shots as I could. It started NW, then made its way more North while dropping in altitude, then went back West passing low enough to be seen in front of the mountains. After that it came back up and went upwards and north. As I zoomed in and focused on the object, I noticed that it had more shape than I had seen. Once I snapped a shot and looked back on my camera to see what it looked like though, THAT'S when I got excited; it was three perfect circles combined to create a triangular shape.  I then snapped as many pics as I could to try and get any sort of different angle on the object, but after maybe 7 minutes of shooting, I decided that I needed to get the tripod because the object was moving further and further away. I didn't want the shots to keep coming out blurry, so after I ran inside to grab the tripod, brought it back outside, and set the camera up on it, the object had disappeared. It was getting pretty far away by the time I got the tripod outside, but I could see it with my naked eye ALL the way up until I got the camera on the tripod. It was as if it was there, and then simply not. THIS VERY WELL COULD HAVE BEEN BALLOONS, MY HOPE IS TO GET AS MUCH FEEDBACK AS POSSIBLE AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN.",2013-06-02T00:00:00,34.17664012738854,-118.38102866242039

I was looking at stars with no visual aid, and saw a satellite heading for the north pole from the southeast.  A reflection in my eyeglasses caused me to turn to my left, where I saw an approaching orange, flame-like glow in the northeast sky at about 45 degrees.  The object was not making any sound, and I expected it to eventually pass overhead.  I actually thought that it might be a hot air balloon, due to the glow and the altitude.  As it continued to approach I noticed that the light had momentarily dimmed, and it was suddenly traveling to the east at a rate of speed that would be greater than a hot air balloon. (surface wind speeds were not above 5MPH at the time).  The light flickered a bit, reduced in size steadily as it travelled away from my position, and ultimately disappeared.   I do not think the time that elapsed from the start to the end of the sighting was more than three or four minutes.  I was not frightened by this sighting and I continued to scan the skies for satellites and aircraft. About twenty minutes later, I witnessed the same exact thing once again.  I was so intent upon making out a shape that I did not run into my house for my camera or binoculars. Because of the time between sightings, I wondered if it was a sightseeing aircraft from the July Fireworks event being held at the Hartness Airport in Springfield.  I looked up the event on its sponsor web site and noted that a group with small experimental aircraft had been offering rides to youngsters that day, but not beyond 4 PM.

Our house is located up Rattlesnake Creek about 1.5 miles north of the Clark Fork River and considered a part of Missoula, Montana.  This area is not a regular airplane route, especially at night, so I paid particular attention to the lights.  When I first spotted the two lights they were maybe 2-3 miles to the north and just above the trees.  They were heading south, down Rattlesnake Creek, at a uniform speed, with one behind the other and at the same altitude.  The large pines along the creek occasionally obstructed my view of the moving lights.  Initially I thought that they may be two helicopters with search lights looking for something or someone.  As they continued south they became larger to the eye and I could see that they were more orb-like and rather large.  They were round or oblong in shape and bright white to gold in color with a red aura near the back end.  It appeared that they were only a couple hundred feet above the ground and when they were within about 1 mile of our home the trailing orb dimmed and went straight up in the air at a high speed and disappeared within a couple of seconds.  The leading orb continued down the creek for another few seconds, then, it too dimmed and headed straight up in the sky light the other one also disappearing in a couple of seconds. This initial encounter lasted about 5 minutes because I had enough to time to run back into the house to yell for my wife to “Hurry, come out, there’s a UFO!” and still continue to monitor the orbs.  My wife made it out after the 3rd call for the last 20 seconds of the sightings.  She went back in the house to get her boots and coat on and shortly after coming back outside, we saw two more orbs in the same area to the north that I first saw the original two.  They were heading in same direction, with the same spacing, altitude and speed as the first ones.  These two orbs were the same shape and color and travelled further south down the creek.  Then as the first two did, the trailing orb dimmed and went straight up in the sky at a fast rate of speed quickly disappearing. The lead orb came within ½ mile of our house and looked to be quite large and bright.

My first thought was “Oh look a shooting star”, but I quickly detained that idea because of the flight the object was on and the color it radiated.  I would say the disc object was no more than 500ft in the air.  Also at the time I saw the object I got a great look at it because of the heat lightning that was occurring during my entire drive.

I took my dog to the park near my home early in the morning after I got off work in the very eastern part of Toronto.  The park is heavily forested where it is easy to the see the stars away from all the lights in the city.  At around 3:00 AM I noticed a bright white light that slowly but surely rose up from beyond the horizon looking East.  At first I thought it was a star but after looking at it carefully I noticed it moved higher in altitude but then it stopped.  The light was brighter than any other star in the sky, but to the average person it can easily be mistaken for a star.  I had a flashlight so I flashed it on and off 3 times toward the light in the sky.  I noticed it start moving a little while after I shun the flashlight.  This time I noticed it started moving toward me but still at a very slow pace, then it stopped again just hovering up there.  It had to be a few thousand feet up in the air and about 10-20 Km in distance from where I was.  It had no blinking lights, it also didn't make a sound.  It was not a plane, helicopter, star, comet, or satellite (I used my Sat App on my phone to check), it could have been drone for all I know but the fact is it was some sort of an unidentified flying object.  The light slowly eventually hovered so far high up I lost sight of it, plus there was a little cloud cover.  After going through my records I realized that this exact same light appeared in the sky last year around the exact same time of the year. I captured it on film roughly in the same location, altitude, and time, it appeared 8 out of 11 nights, the last sighting being on September 2nd, 2012.  I haven't seen it since until now almost a year later to the day.  It also always appears from beyond the horizon around 3-4 AM and it almost always slowly hovers its way up so high that you just lose sight of it.  I will go out tonight to see if I see it again.

I mean slow like a single prop Cessna that is just taking off from the ground, pretty slow. But these craft were fairly high up.  I began to see another craft of a similar character emerge from the heavy cloud layers, just behind the other one, maybe like a 2-3 second count behind the first one.  Then another one, and another one.  All told I counted 5-6 craft, in an F-shaped formation (with the first craft solo), all traveling at the same speed and with no noise whatsoever.  This is why I felt these craft were unusual as the cloud layer is not that high, estimated lower than 2000 feet.  I am basing this elevation on how these clouds were at or near the height of local Chuckanut Mountain (about 1600 feet) which I am familiar with.  Also, the f! light pattern is not a local flight pattern at all, and the military jets that do come into Bellingham are quite loud.

They all think I'm seeing things, but how could we all be ""thinking"" we see the same thing?  Our latest sighting of the light was September 1, 2013 at 7:19 (19:19).  The sunset on that day was said to occur at 7:27, so the sun was still up pretty good. The sky was still very well lit and blue, so no stars were out yet. If any stars were out, they would've been in the eastern sky since the sun was setting in the west.  We were driving into Grenada on highway 8 west when I was looking at the sunset and I noticed what appeared to be a star up above the sunset in the middle of the bright blue sky.  This is exactly how it looked the first time I saw it, so I instantly knew what it was.  I quickly tell my girlfriend to record a video with her phone and point out to her where it is.  As I'm pointing, the light does what it has done every other time we've seen it.  The best way I can explain what happens is imagine a normal looking star, just in the middle if the day.  As we are looking at the light, it fades out of sight.  Then, about 10 seconds later, it comes back into view!   About 30 seconds after that, it fades out again and this time it stayed gone. We kept looking and didn't see it again until about 5 minutes later when we were in Grenada still looking for it. We have seen this ""light"" about 3 different times now and nobody will believe us.  After we see it every time, I feel like I need to tell somebody about it. I don't care how crazy people think we are or if people think we are making it up, I know what I saw, I know other people with me have seen it, and there is something going on above Grenada. Now, to denounce any skeptical ideas anyone may have. I promise I've heard plenty. It wasn't a flashing light from a cellphone tower or any other tower.  This light wasn't ""hovering"" above the ground. It was in the sky.  I'm talking miles in the sky.  Higher than a plane. If you can find a tower 5 miles high, show me.  It wasn't a plane light flashing. It was still daylight outside so I wouldn't have seen the lights that easily. I have considered it being the sunlight reflecting off a plane or jet, but it's still just way too high for any of our aircraft. It looks exactly like a star, it just fades in and out randomly. Not on a set amount of time or anything. It could be visible for 5 minutes and then fade out or it could be there for 10 seconds and then fade out. It's random. I just think its very strange to keep seeing this thing and nobody else notices. I want to know what it is.",2013-09-09T00:00:00,33.7514,-89.82316923076922

What were those lights hanging in the sky over the city of Moore just a day-and-a-half before the deadly tornado that struck the storm-weary suburb? It was on Saturday, May 18th, at approximately 8:45 p.m. when the strange lights were observed by this independent journalist. Having spent the afternoon in Norman, a city 17 miles south of my home in Oklahoma City, my five-year old son and I were driving north along Interstate 35 as we approached the exit in Moore for SW 4th Street.  As we approached it, where the interstate makes a slight jog to the west, in the sky ahead, somewhere over downtown Moore, or slightly north of it, were approximately 8 faded-red lights.  There was an eerie glow about them and they appeared to hang in the sky or rise slightly.  It was mostly cloudy that evening, and slightly windy. Perplexed, and trying to determine if they were flares, Chinese lanterns or even glowing balloons, I kept looking up at them to see if I could make out what they were.  Realizing that this was not a wise thing to do while driving 63-m.p.h. on a busy interstate, I kept my eye on the lights as I got off at the next exit, for NW 12th Street, just north of downtown. Now that I was on the access road, I pulled onto Pratt Lane, which feeds into the access road just south of 12th. I pulled in front of a house and could still see a few of them. However, by the time I got my cell phone to take a couple of pictures, I could no longer see them My son, interestingly enough, was captivated by the lights as well, asking his dad what the “light ghosts” were. Good question, son. I dialed *55 and got ahold of the dispatcher with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. I described the lights and where I saw them and she took down the information, saying that while she had not received any reports, she would inquire with Moore Police Department. And curiously, the area where the lights were could have been – Chestnut Avenue and Main Street – is right near the Moore Police Department. And yet, when I called the department the next day – Sunday morning – the dispatcher said they had received no reports of strange, red lights and were not sure what they were. Researching “strange lights Moore” online, the National UFO Reporting Center had some reports made by witnesses in Moore last spring and summer. One report – almost to the day prior to my sighting – described “yellow-orange circular sighting with ascending lights above Moore, Ok.” That was on May 20, 2012. And then, on June 26, 2012, a report from Moore refers to a “fireball object in plain view.” And another report that is similar to mine was made in neighboring Oklahoma City. This report referred to “multiple silent red orbs under power over Oklahoma City, approx. 5 min. in duration.” In fact, most of the reports made by witnesses in Oklahoma tend to refer to “lights.” Because of the EF-5 tornado that blew through Moore on May 20th, we have been unable to get back to the scene in an easy fashion and recreate the scene and try and determine exactly where the lights were hovering and a possible, scientific explanation for what it was we were watching that night. We hope to have more on this report at a later time.",2013-06-02T00:00:00,,

We exited the car to look closer, since the lights emanating from the craft were not the typical yellow-white lights of military craft or helicopters, but a flame-orange color, singular. The lights flew in double-single-double formation, approaching from the North, and flew South for a distance before heading West, seemingly following Route 15 across Lake Champlain—but as soon as these crafts turned, the lights disappeared from the sky right before our eyes.  They didn’t blink like normal aircraft do when in flight, they were steady, even compared to the other visible planes flying much higher. The lights flew low, but seemed extraordinarily small—likely not more than a few hundred, perhaps a thousand feet off the ground.  Still, they moved quickly, likely at speeds from 70/100mph judging from the rate of motion.  We witnessed easily over 20 of these lights, but anywhere up to 40. We then decided to drive about a quarter-mile past the intersection where we were stopped, and from the speed at which we closed in on the lights, I realized they couldn’t be flying high. After we made it to the closest light, no more appeared from that direction.  Though there were easily 50 cars that passed through the same intersection, and at least one coming from our direction, no one else stopped to look at the high number of unusual lights, likely small aircraft of some sort.  I tried my best to catch it on film and I’ll see if I can brighten up what I got later.  But from what I could see, the lights did not appear on my phone, despite the brightness with which they were lit. I don’t know what I just saw.  At first I thought they might be military planes or helicopters, but there was no audible noise of either (and from the sheer number, there would have been some noise to be heard if that’s what they had been).  But my mother and I saw them, even if it seems no one else did. I’ve seen a lot of weird things in my life, but I think this takes the cake. I don’t believe the lights were of terrestrial origin.",2013-06-02T00:00:00,,

This last sighting was also observed 1.5 miles away by my roommate. I've been seeing this same BIG dingy yellow lighted craft several times, and as before it flies slow like a ultra-lite would but about 6ooo feet approx. The craft gives itself away by dimming out the light insted of winking out as a light switch would and usually does this in the airport area or when in visual distance of another aircraft . Note: no navigation lights blink in the 9 sightings ive had, but only the slow odd but big dingy butter colored light that goes out allways, like a dimmer cut it down too off. This has been on going and i really hope others may become aware so as to confirm the craft as a real aircraft . I must add I never seen it turn away from me so if its a extra large landing light it should not turn off like it does and there are no clouds between the craft and the ground because the stars shine bright blue  white around it . The slighly dingy light is much larger and noticable than any navigation light and appears to light the bottom of the entire craft. It does not show a beam light as a landing light does. No aircraft should cut off all its lights and dissapear as this craft does. HIGHLY NOTICEABLE,VERY SLOW AND SILENT , AND A BIG YELLOISH LIGHT W/NO NAVIGATION LIGHT OR STROBES AND DIMS OUT slowly or about 1.5 seconds to go completely off! Brightness of the light is equal to the stars but 5x larger . This i believe is wide spread in my area,very common and no ultra-lights take off or fly at any airports in the area. Langley AFB is 3 mile away from this last sighting. I'm sure there has been pilot radio reports of air traffic in unassigned locations and unusual speed and extra large lighting circumfrence with no strobes or navigation lights. I have seen what i believe as the exact craft 9 times some at high altitude so as to possibly rule out a ultra-light!  A non threatning craft but somehow sneaky dimming its light when other aircraft come near or when approaching the Newportnews/Williamsburg  International airport which it over flew at about 4000 feet altitude. This is not a rare event,once you see the color its a easy distintive unique big size is very easily reconized. Take look for yourselves please,i just know this craft does not follow the rules .

I live in north Glendale, north of the Loop 101 highway in the area of  67th avenue. At approximately 7:15 pm, I happened to glance out my kitchen window that faces north, and I observed some bright orange lights traveling from the west to east.  It seemed unusual, so I went out into my back yard to investigate further.   At that time I observed multiple bright orange objects coming from what appeared to be the Lake Pleasant area which is approximately 15-20 miles northwest of my home.  They were traveling from the west to the east.   In my mind, I immediately thought these appeared to be Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO’s).  I immediately thought to myself, “If I don’t get pictures, nobody is going to believe me.”  I re-entered my home and got my I phone and started to take pictures.   The objects were being partially blocked by some trees on the golf course so I decided to go out on the golf course where I could obtain non-obstructed pictures.   I have a great interest in UFO’s and have done a fair amount of reading up on them and was convinced the probability was high that these were in fact UFO’s. I filmed these objects for probably over 5 minutes.  At one point my video stopped and I had to restart it again.  I was in awe because they just keep coming.  I would estimate as many as 150 of these orange objects.   It’s hard to estimate their speed.  They were not going as fast as a military jet and they were not stopped.  They seemed to maintain a constant speed that I would have to estimate at 150-200 mph.  I did not see any particular formation.  There would be 5-7 of them traveling together and others following behind in a line.   It appeared to me that when I first saw them coming from the Lake Pleasant area, that as they came higher they were trying to catch up to those ahead.  They maintained a constant orange glow with no flickering.  I observed no other lights on them, just the orange glow. I know that the Phoenix area had reports of a meteor last night.  This was not a meteor.  A meteor travels so fast that if you blink, you may well miss it.  Meteors are generally a white flash of light or fire looking and these objects were bright orange in color and had a controlled speed far less than a meteor.   This was not a weather balloon as the government might claim.  There were approximately 150 of them and they were rising at a speed inconsistent with a weather balloon.  These were not Chinese candles (candle lit objects that rise from the heat of the candle).  The objects were much too fast to be Chinese candles.   These were not military flares as some might think.  They were rising, not falling, as flares do after being shot into the air or falling after being dropped. Once again these objects were traveling from west to east at approximately 150-200 mph and as they passed just slightly east of my home they seemed to just disappear.   This parade continued for over 5 minutes.  As some would disappear, others would appear from the lake area. When all were gone, I went back into my house to call family to tell them what I had seen. Like most people out there some were believers and others had their doubts.  I thought “but I have video proof”, and when I went to view the pictures, nothing was visible, just a black screen.   I know what I saw and unless someone has a better explanation, I feel that I was fortunate enough to see what many of us hope to see someday and will not.   I have absolutely no reason to make false claims or file false reports.

We saw a large, elongated object emerge from a group of trees.  The object was similar in size to a large passenger plane.  It was traveling from North-West to South-East. It immediately caught our attention because it was bright white (similar to the bright- ness of the moon) and completely illuminated.  There were not any flashing lights or any colored lights. The front was larger and tapered off at the back.  It was traveling much faster than any type of plane any of us had ever seen.

This is an incident which has long deserved a report with the national UFO reporting center, but I have had a great deal of anxiety regarding the sighting as it involves what I believe to be an encounter with extra-terrestrial beings later that evening. I was travelling on a cross country trip to the west in Iowa on I believe (from photos taken from this trip) to be US Route 30. While travelling,  I saw a large Emerald Green Object alight in the western sky, about 10 degrees altitude above the western horizon.  From my estimation, the apparent astronomical magnitude of the object was in the range of -10 (full moon is approximately -12.94).  This was by far the brightest object in the sky at the time of the sighting. Furthermore, the object (or the green light emitted by the object) was spherical. The object was momentarily stationary (1-2s), and thence proceeded to move rapidly towards the North.  The object traversed about 100 degrees azimuthal angle at a rate of 12-15(degress/sec), and then rapidly faded in magnitude until it was no longer visible.  The trajectory of the object seemed both too low, and too slow to be of meteoric origin.  From my estimation, this object was well within the troposphere for the entire course of its trajectory. As the object traversed the sky, it left a trail of white flecks of light behind it.  The trail was linear, and about 15 degrees of azimuth in length and constant in magnitude.  There was no sound accompanying the traversal of the object. I was quite shaken by the incident, and pulled off at a local gas station.  I had taken many photos of the gas station in attempt to recall the location of the object. With the sighting, I strongly recall the thought ""I should not have seen that.""  After driving from Iowa south into Missouri, I pulled off to take a few hours of rest in the car.  The car was parked on the side of a small county road on a bridge over the Nodaway river (which is a tributary to the Missouri river).  The time was about 2AM. At this point, I was attempting to get some rest, when I perceived a white light around the vehicle along with the silhouettes of three extra-terrestrial beings.  The beings were about 4ft tall as measured relative to the window of the vehicle.  One of the beings was in front of the car, and two were on the left side (I was in the drivers seat of the car).  I had the sense that there was a fourth being near the back of the vehicle. I then recall ""waking up"" and the time was 6AM.  I was very tired, and sweaty, as if I had exerted myself physically during the previous four hours.  I a vague recollection of what transpired during this four hour period.  I can unequivocally say that the perception of the beings and the light was not a dream.  This is corroborated by the fact that I have a detailed memory of this experience. I will be happy to work with the National UFO reporting center in order to shed further light on the UFO sighting itself, as well as other events in connection with the sighting including details left out of this cursory account.",2013-07-22T00:00:00,,

I was sitting with a Swedish friend having our first beer and out from over a small Island located directly in front of the establishment, I could see a white light.   As it caught my eye, it began to grow larger and larger as it became close and closer.  It came right over my head and came to a stop aprox 50 to 70 feet and gyrated right over my head without any sound.  It was gyrating around the edges and had a symbol in the middle that I could only describe in a drawing but can clearly remember it to this day.   I would say it was about 40 to 50 feet in diameter.  It sat there for about 10 seconds or less and in an instant, was gone in a flash.   A minute or so passed another one doing the same thing came along, same pater and same result and another minute or so the third one came along.   I was left looking in the sky for months after that for more sighting.  It was an amazing experience, one that I will never forget!!",2013-07-22T00:00:00,,

I apologize as this is not exactly a sighting of a UFO but rather a strange and unexplainable occurrence in our atmosphere.  I have tried telling this story a few places and around the internet but have gotten no feedback, corroboration, or other information from any of these sources and I was actually hoping you could possibly tell me that I and my partner who also witnessed this are not alone in seeing this type of occurrence.   It was the summer of 2011 (I'm sorry I cannot tell you the exact date) and the sky had 100% cloud cover.  The clouds were very low and dark but not too dark.  It looked like a storm of some sort was brewing so me and my partner went out into the street to see what sort of natural spectacle that storms normally produce.   Then without any thunder or noise of any sort a ""grid"" made up of perfect hexagons of what could only appear to be electricity appeared over head.  I would say it formed about 3 rows at a time of chains of perfectly shaped hexagons that moved or scanned back and forth across the sky in an east-to-west direction.   There was no thunder, no rain; only these ""electrical"" shapes.   I was mesmerized but I would say the formation lasted approx. 1 minute and scanned back and forth changing direction several times.   I have never heard of any sort of event and I cannot seem to find anyone who can shed any more light on this.   Again I apologize as this is not exactly a UFO sighting but I have exhausted all other sources and am desperate for some type of clue. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

He said he claimed to see a green light falling from the sky and I said maybe it was just a shooting star but when he claimed to see another one I looked and saw nothing a few minutes later he went in the house and I started to hallucinate started seeing things coming out of the water (to hard to explain) and I became really paranoid so I called him back down.  When he came back the figure was gone.  So we sat and talked then all of a sudden we both seen a green light falling from the west but it seemed to disappear this time but right above it their was just this massive fireball that just came out of absolutely nothing.   Me and my cousin both bolted to the house wit!h fear over both of our faces and we refused to go back outside.  We have not stopped going here every summer though.  And the more we go the more we see like last year for instance we were among 3 others walking and we all encountered three to four shooting stars in a matter of hours.  We all claimed to have seen different colors with every one we saw.   All i know is that this general area is not very populated and its very easy to see the sky at night.

I woke up at approximately 2:00 AM (unsure of the exact time) and got out of bed to get a drink of water.  While in my kitchen I saw a flash of light through the curtains and it startled me.  I went to open the door to look outside and saw storm-clouds rolling by overhead, so I figured the flash must have been from lightning.   As I shut the door, I saw a bright flash light up the window again, but this time it was sustained for a few seconds, much like car headlights in the window (which was impossible because window isn't facing a road or any cars) but a lot more brilliant.   I reached for the door and went outside, walked to the front of the building where I lived and looked out up the street to the main thoroughfare (4th avenue). At the corner of 4th and and 27th street, just above a restaurant that is there, a hub-cap shaped object hovered roughly 40-45 feet above the street.  It was silver in color, had some small lights on the edge of it and on the top, ranging from red, green and white.  I'd estimate the disc itself approximately 75 feet in diameter.  Underneath it looked like a series of pulsing lightning bolts firing inward to a central point, similar to spokes on a bicycle tire.  The ""lightning bolts"" were an odd color, like the blue of a gas flame.  There was a misty blue ""aura"" on the underside of the object as well.   Object was quiet and I don't recall hearing any sound with it, but I felt a strong sense of static in the air. I don't know why, but I only watched the object for a few seconds, then I turned around,  went back to my apartment and went back to bed.   For some reason I have a dream-like partial memory of seeing the same object hovering over my apartment building, blotting out a portion of the cloudy night sky.  I wrote the details of the sighting down in my diary the next morning.   There were no other witnesses (to my knowledge) and I haven't mentioned this to anyone until now.

P.D.T. Location of Sighting: 15 miles north of Santa Barbara, Ca. LATITUDE: 34.46226N  LONGITUDE: 120.02726W El Capitan State Beach Tonight at approximately 20:40, I witnessed a large triangular shaped vehicle with approximately 7 bright but muted or blurred lights* traveling at a slow speed headed due East towards Santa Barbara California. Craft made no sounds. The vehicle caught my eye initially because of the color of the lights.* The vehicles altitude is hard to judge because it was dark but if I had to guess I would say approximately 1500 to 2000 feet. If, that guess is correct that would make the size of the craft maybe three times the size of a Boeing 747. The craft was witnessed by myself and I was accompanied by wife and there were approximately 15 guest of the park who witnessed the craft at the same time. I brought the vehicle to the attention of the group and asked if they were in fact seeing what I was witnessing?  All answered in the affirmative. The vehicle was moving so slowly we all got a good look at its speed, then it appeared to come to a complete stop, but only momentarily.  Then the vehicle began to move in a forward direction but also appeared to be headed in a vertical direction.  We continued to monitor the vehicle its movement was vertical and slowly east. It then began to appear to gain momentum but suddenly it disappeared. Initially, I thought it may have been an aircraft of some sort because we are on the approach to the Santa Barbara Airport. I also thought that it may have been an aircraft from Vandenburg Air Force Base, which is just to the north of the park approximately 30 miles.  Although it is my understanding that no flight wing exists at VFB, I have witnessed missile launches from that base, both daytime and night launches, none of those launches were anything even remotely like the vehicle we witnessed tonight.  No craft I have ever seen have the ability to accelerate so quickly that they disappear. Having witnessed hundreds of commercial as well as private and military aircraft I knew this was not any of those aircraft at least of the type I had ever witnessed. I must mention that during my career I spent 6 years working in the Mojave, California area, where my office was on the perimeter of the Mojave Air and Space Port as well as our neighbors to the southeast Edwards Air Force Base. I have witnessed thousands of aircraft flying in and out of both of these facilities as well as China Lake Naval Weapons Station which aircraft are in the air almost constantly. The vehicle that was flying over the Park this evening was like nothing I or any of the other witnessed that I discussed the sighting with tonight had ever seen. I then traveled to the other side of the park and spoke to another guest who was a retired firefighter and his wife, they too saw the vehicle and were unable to explain the vehicle in any other terms than, ""We saw a UFO this evening"". The behavior of this vehicle is like nothing commercial, private or military I have ever witnessed. *Nor was the lighting, the color of the lights were something between yellow and orange and very bright.  Those are not colors normally associated with any aircraft I have ever witnessed.  The vehicle had no strobe or marker lights whatsoever.",2013-09-09T00:00:00,34.317038103448276,-119.72054137931035

We both watched as it just hovered, neither making sound nor moving.  Then slowly it began to glide north.  It looked like an orange ball of fire with some green in it.  It flickered like fire, then seemed to fizzle out much like the flame does on a candle wick.  It reappeared once or twice before completely disappearing.  From the time we first went outside and saw this thing to the time it disappeared was less than 5 minutes.  We then proceeded to drive to the duckpond, but as we were in route the orb reappeared, it flickered then shot up in the sky and disappeared. Once we arrived at the duckpond  (a 5 minute drive) the orb reappeared and this time a second one accompanied it.  One seemed slightly larger than the other, but both looked like balls of fire in the sky.  Their ! distance from each other never changed, but their altitudes did, gliding smoothly and silently, one higher than the other, both moving at what looked like the same slow speed.  Both orbs intermittently disappeared and reappeared, but finally the bottom orb never reappeared, leaving the orb with the higher altitude, the original larger orb, to glide silently across the sky for miles until it fizzled out and disappeared.  Our entire experience lasted approximately 30 minutes.  Our neighbor’s son also saw it and he described the ball as being a red ball of fire.  I tried to take video of the phenomenon but could not get video to work until orbs disappeared.  I was able to get 3 pictures of poor quality. Approximately a year ago my daughter and I saw what looked like the same ball of fire in the same part of the sky.

As someone interested in astronomy as a hobby, I was looking up in the clear sky admiring the stars, particularly the Big Dipper.  I looked towards the horizon and saw what I first thought was an oncoming aircraft.  I assumed it was an aircraft as there was the typical bright light and the blinking red and green lights on either side.  However, after viewing for a few minutes, I noticed that the object didn't move but appeared stationary and was 'setting' with the rest of the stars.  I grabbed my 4"" telescope but wasn't able to make out too much except that the lights appeared to separate at times from the main body.  This could have been due to the atmospheric conditions.  The next evening (tonight) my brother was over for a visit and both he and my wife witnessed the same object,! moving in the same path as last night and still have the red and green blinking lights. When viewing through the telescope, by brother noted that it appears there were flames ejecting at times from the object and surrounded the colored lights.  I wasn't able to see the same as my eyesight is not as good at night.  However, I mentioned to him that he may be seeing the reflection of the sun off a tumbling object.  I'm very skeptical about UFO's, but for me, this is an unidentified space object, only because I can't find any logical explanation of this object.  Does anyone have any suggestions?
