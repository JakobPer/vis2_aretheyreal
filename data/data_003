It was getting close to 21:00 before we got there and they said they could still see it but it was fainter in the sky as the sun was setting.  The kids could still see it with their naked eye but I had to use the telescope as my eye sight is not as good as theirs.  It was a circular object and I could not tell if it was like a ball or more like a wheel.  The center seemed to be transparent almost like it was a bubble.  It looked like it was a clock face with only one hand showing or a wheel with only one spoke.  Inside the circle was a rectangular shape with a blinking light on each corner.  The object went back and forth from east to west and then back from west to east.  It was moving fast enough that you had to move the telescope to keep it in sight.  It was not shooting across the sky, but more drifting.  It seemed like it was following a grid or mapping.  It faded in and out and was not always visible.  It flashed bright orange one time but only for a second.  I wondered if the distant lightning was reflecting off it.  There were several planes in the area but we live within a couple of miles of a small airport.  We would really like to know if it was something that could be explained.  We posted it on Facebook and had several replies that our friends and neighbors went out to see if they could see it.  Only one friend said they saw 2 of them.  No one else said they could see it.",2020-08-20T00:00:00,35.9592,-96.7554

I’m accustomed to understanding the world around me and what I see. Saturday night, my wife and I both saw something I can not explain. It was an orange orb moving across the sky. I’m guessing it was between 5-10,000 feet in altitude and roughly the size of a 747 at that height moving at about the same speed as a commercial airliner at that altitude. The most common explanation online is a Chinese lantern, it was not one. I held an ATF license for commercial fireworks for 3 years and have set off many Chinese lanterns.  It moved in a straight line with no changes in speed or direction. We watched it for a solid 60 seconds from directly overhead to disappearing over the horizon moving north to south. Comparing it to a full moon, it appeared to be ¼ to ½ of the size. It was very large compared to anything else I’ve ever seen. It also made no noise. No sound of an engine, no hum, nothing.

Thought you guys might want to include this one from back in 2007.  It was big news in the Okanagan.  Within a week after the incident we had an AWACS in the area, for the first time ever. A large triangular black vehicle was spotted in the sky above Okanagan Mountain park (near the dog-leg in the lake) from multiple viewpoints across a 20km stretch of highway and 3 towns.  Witnesses in Kelowna, West Bank, and Peachland.  A semicircle around the mountain.  Some saw the initial triangle first, and some saw the two vehicles in the ensuing engagement.  Sequence of events: -Black triangle or cone spotted in dim twilight sky, hovering stationary above Okanagan Mountain. -""torpedo shaped vehicle with fins"" the size of a large jet, arrives at high speed, and stops in midair roughly over the lake, at the same altitude, within a km of the triangle.  With its nose pointed towards it. -after a short period while stationary, the torpedo shaped object erupts into flames, and goes into freefall towards surface of lake, emitted a ""wom wom wom"" in a deep bass tone. -the torpedo shaped object slows, and with conflicting reports either hits or just misses the surface of the lake. -the torpedo object rises back up, points its nose at the black triangle in the process, and opens fire with a volley of ""star wars style blaster shots"", which bear some resemblance to red tracer fire from an automatic cannon of some kind. -the triangle shoots away at impossible speed before the rounds impact. -the torpedo shaped object returns to the original altitude, and starts darting around ""like a hummingbird"" before shooting away in the same direction as the triangle.  At the very least, this was a military incident.  A major one.  It might add to the tapestry of events from the same time period.

I was going to see my girlfriend who was working at a local bar.  Left my home on bicycle heading into Hamilton on westridge rd.  Heading east towards and over the Bitterroot river.  As I approached the bridge on the river to my left I noticed lights hovering over the water at first I thought it to be a cell tower.  I was fairly new to the area but looking back I thought it was strange that I figured it to be a cell tower.  The lights were in a triangular pattern. While completely silent it hovered over the water.  Once I noticed it to be something out of the norm.  It noticed me notice it.  There was some kind of telepathic interaction occurring at this time.  As I was riding past the lights became more pronounced and the craft hovered directly over and past me heading towards downtown Hamilton on my other side.  I remember trying to pedal fast to chase after it as much as possible. I also remembering having much hesitation because of possibly becoming an abductee.  I still pedaled hard after this completely silent object that was only a 100 or so feet above me hovering it's way downtown.  I also recall the craft having a large powerful white light in the middle that I felt harnessed all the energy. For being  completely silent it emanated power and force in a very strange way that I have never witnessed.  As I gave chase and did my best to get my mind around what this was it reached the brickwork of downtown and literally shot off into the east over the Skalkaho pass. At this time a large forest fire was burning on those mountains. I also thought it may have been a helicopter going for water.  It definitely wasn't though not in my fair opinion.  I reached the bar and told my girl everything that happened.  She was intrigued and wanted to see it for herself. I always had a lot of strange feelings where we lived there on Westbridge Rd.  It was a creepy place just kind of felt watched there was no other way to explain it.  My dog chased off what I thought to be a bear at one time but looking back I feel it may have been a little more bizarre.  I have had sleep paralysis episodes on the property in a guest house on one or two occasions that I can recall. Keyword is recall.  My body is tensed up   shaking when trying to recall exactly what happened in that valley after all those years. I feel like much of the experience is locked away from my memory. Two or so weeks after the first event I was strolling out of our guesthouse to go to my garden shed when I looked out over the river once again hovering was the same triangular craft. This time my girl was with me. I rushed inside to grab her so she could witness it.  We came back out just in time for her to see it at which point it again noticed us notice it and started to head off east again towards the Sapphire mountain range. I again hopped on my bike thinking somehow I could catch it. For some reason I was truly hypnotized by how strange and novel this craft was. Logically I knew for a fact I would never catch up to or even if see it for more than the few seconds it took to reach light speed or whatever it was trying to accomplish. Gone. It just disappeared. Fast too. I felt mass amounts of energy in the atmosphere just before it did its little magic trick. One day I may try to analyze this all further with some sort of regression technique but at this point my first m! ajor step is to report it. Something deep inside feels like there is much more to this story than I can actively recall. I also used to travel around this area quite a bit hosting weddings and other events. I have witnessed a shooting green fire ball again fly over from the Bitterroot mountains over the valley floor and then. Boom. Gone. Right over or into the Sapphire mountain range. This particular sighting was south of Darby Montana. My girl and I also recall a time when we were driving into Hamilton from Woodside cutoff. Right past the bridge over the river I nearly hit what I thought was a raccoon or something the closer I looked it more resembled something on two legs. It looked more like a chimpanzee or monkey. I never linked all these experiences together but the further I get away from that valley the more strangeness I remember. The very last thing i want mention is an experience I had one early morning outside of Jackson Montana which is east of the Bitterroot valley in the Big Hole. We ! were packing up some studio gear from a show we booked at the local Hot Springs and my lady this time was sleeping inside while I was getting everything packed up. I heard the most unnatural strange frightening sound in my 36 years. At first I thought a cow was dying out in the pasture. There are many cows and livestock in this area but it didn't sound that way. It sounded more aggressive but like something on it's way out but more like something that is going to kill too. Rabies was all I could think. If a bison got rabies that would be the sound it was very loud and large whatever it was. If you ever want to experience the strange head to these parts of Montana something is definitely going on.,2020-05-01T00:00:00,46.1612,-114.1401

It would have been either a Friday or Saturday night as I often work till 10pm.  At about 1:40 am I was taking out some recycle items to the garage and as I often do, looking up.  I usually look for the north star and if visible Orion’s Belt, then maybe look to planets as I live in Markham, Ontario and there is a far bit of light from the city so we do not see a great number of stars often.  On this night I saw something I didn’t tell anyone because it looked out of place.  It looked like a giant, translucent squid.  However (to circle back to the NASA video) I have since found a video on YouTube from July 9, 2010  (china airport) of and ! I am certain the same UFO.  I have since looked at that video a few times on a large screen TV and I am positive it was the same thing ( creature, ship, capsule) not sure.  The thing that stuck me the most was I remember the thing what I would call “bursting through the air or some part of the air”.  I would estimate the height of travel to be about 60,000 feet as it was about twice the height of air travel, direction of travel was southwest to northeast.

The highway that we were on runs north and south.To the west is all Everglades, to the east is Sunrise, Up in the sky way way west we saw a comet shaped object moving west to east in an arc shaped motion.It looked like a blueish sphere with a reddish comet-like tail.It was way too high to see any real detail. The object was moving at an incredable rate of speed. Suddenly the comet tail went out and all you could see was the blue orb. When the UFO was over the road (still way to high to see detail) the tail""fired"" twice, like some kind ofafte rburners.And was rocketed out of sight to the east ina matter of seconds, way faster than anything either of us had ever seen.

I thought it was strage, but I sthat it might be a satellite that had moved itself into a geosynchronous orbit or possibly the space shutle that had done the same. Than it started to move strangely. It started to do little zig-zag patterns and move very slowly and rock back and forth. It also did a couple of 90 degree turns. I watched it for about 10 minutes, than I went and woke up my dad. He came and we watched it zig-zag and turn and start and stop and do spirals. The spirals seemed strange, to me, because it would start out with a big, slow circle and than the circle would began to tighten and it would speed up untill it had come to rest where it started. I think I can best desc!ribe the spirals as looking like a planet falling into the sun. All this time the sum of its movemets were bringing it twards the west (twards us). My window faces East. At one point I thought I saw a small light seperate from it and head South-West. It was so faint that I wouldent have thought anything of it except that my dad asked me if I saw it. My dad went back to bed about 0515 and by 0530 it was out of sight over my roof.

The formation was by no means sloppy but I did notice it was somewhat fluid, as the objects did not remain perfectly equidistant among themselves in the “V” flight pattern, as say a precision team of fighter pilots at an air show would, nor did they maintain perfect symmetry in the two individual leading lines of the “v” formation, as a few individual members of the formation drifted ever so slightly ahead of their flanks. This fluidity made it obvious that what we witnessed was not one large “V” shaped craft with 20 to 25 lights, but indeed a formation composed of 20 to 25 individual members. Their appearance and passing was completely and utterly silent. The event occurred approximately 2 hours after a fairly low tide and the night was still, ! so there was no crashing surf nor wind, and therefore no ambient natural sounds to drown out the sounds of jet engines or sonic booms - - this event, and these objects, were completely silent.  The objects flew along the coastline north to south. From our vantage point on the cliff I’d estimate their path approximately 45 to 50 degrees above the horizon. They appeared as bright points of light, brighter than any star in the sky at their closest proximity to our position. They came as dim points of light from the north, grew amazingly bright on near approach, and dimmed fairly quickly after passing, maintaining a steady high altitude throughout...they dimmed to nothingness at altitude, not disappearing behind tree line nor mountaintop...therefore I’m thinking they surely must have been traversing at least in the upper atmosphere, perhaps at near-earth satellite altitude. The event took place in 20 seconds, no more than 30. Their speed? Impressive, is all I can say.  My first thought was that what we witnessed was a SpaceX satellite array. But after some Googling I’m not sure:  Satellite arrays appear to travel in single file...it appears I’m going to need a little more research!  My wife and I are middle-aged professionals; sober star-gazers...but certainly not trained observers of aerial phenomena. I have tried to portray the gist of what we observed as clearly and succinctly as possible. I hope it is useful. We will check back with this website in the near future to see if perhaps others had a similar sighting. This was my first potential UFO sighting and first visit to site...thanks for the hard work and for being here!",2020-11-05T00:00:00,44.8129,-124.0568

Some were streaking by and some going very slow.  I even seen some intersect each other, stop for a second and shoot off the other way.  After observing that for about 20 minutes with binoculars, I went and got my wife.  She also observed the white orbs. But then it got very interesting.  While me and my wife were still watching, I seen a darker object which at first I thought was a bird. I kept watching it and I noticed it was moving oddly and in certain movements there was a very bright reflection coming off of it. It became apparent to me that it wasn't a bird. So I grabbed my binoculars for a closer look, and to my amazement it was in fact a flying saucer in every sense of the word.

Intermittent lights and movement. Due to covid-19 I have been sheltering at my cabin in north central PA.  It is among a group of camps out in the woods. Last night, as normal, I took my dog out before retiring for the night.  My camp is right by a trout stream. I walked about 50 yards south of my camp and waited for him to do his thing.  As I turned to go back I noticed a bright yellow light  through the trees near  a large camp across and down stream from me. At first I thought it was the moon and moved closer to get a better view through a clearing in the trees.  It was an object that was about 60 feet above the ground and about 150 yards from me just suspended and stationary in the air.  I should mention that I am a retired mechanical engineer and a trained observer.  No alcohol or drugs ever. I moved even closer to a bigger opening and saw it was lit very brightly on one side, enough that I could see it was spherical, about 8-10 feet in diameter.  The unlit portion was very dark, possibly black with a rough surface texture.   There was a rectangular box at the bottom about 4 feet wide and 18 inches high that would light up with 3 horizontal bars of light and then go out every 30 seconds or so.  It was so dark I could only tell it was there when it lit up. Suddenly, it began moving back and forth horizontally about 2 feet or so.  Then vertically the same way.  It would stop for a little while then start again.  During one of these forays it moved about 20 yards closer to me then returned to the original position.  It moved easily as if there was no inertia.  My dog was afraid to approach me or it. That prompted me to return to my camp to get my cell phone and take video.   While coming back with my phone I could no longer see it. When I got back to the clearing I finally saw it, at least the light, about 1/3 mile down stream traveling slowly away barely above the tree line. Then I lost sight of it.

I assumed it was a plane.  It was coming straight towards my house.  I called my 11 year old son to come outside and watch it with me. When it flew directly over top of my house, I realized it was not a plane. It was very very low, about as low as people normally fly a drone, but there was NO noise. It was dead silent. It was the exact shape, color, and size as a star, but it was moving at a very steady speed, in a completely straight line, and WAY lower. We could not figure out what it was. Our neighbor has a drone, and they are very loud and go all over the place, up or down. I have never witnessed an! ything like this thing before in my life.

There was no noise and no identifiable flapping of wings.  The objects were circular in shape, and had a brownish hue, with very slight aura of diffused light around.  There was no real identifiable tail light of bright colour, and this formation flew what seemed to be very methodical, and did not break its flying formation for the quick time that I witnessed it.

Crop Circle. [Update:  Event year and age corrected. Details added for clarity.]   In 1979, I was 15 years old and a resident of Iroquois Job Corps Center (IJCC) in Medina, NY. I often walked along the main road--Tibbits Road--that led onto the property. One mid afternoon, about a city block's  distance from IJCC, I saw just off the right side of the road an odd flat circular pattern of green intertwined stalks of wheat. For some reason the joints  (nodes?) fascinated me; maybe because they looked undamaged. In fact, the stalks were so flat and neat, that from a certain angle the pattern looked glossy. The circle wasn’t very big, maybe about 7 feet in diameter. It was an awesome sight. At the time, I could not imagine what type of machinery had created the circle. (I had since learned that it was a crop circle) Its presence did scare me a little, because I had never seen anything like it before that day (nor since it). I don't remember if I told anyone at the Center about what I saw. Likely, I told one of the participants. Weeks later, on a late summer evening, me and three other residents left the property and walked very far to a bar in a neighboring town that only had about 3 or 4 letters to its name. It was nearing sunset, and mid way, the roads became pitch dark. There was only one or two farms with dim lighting. And there was moonlight, I think. (I think we took Sour Springs Road all the way to its end then turned onto another road located near a 'Chapel' Road. But we were still quite a ways from our destination. My next clear memory is of us standing at a (white?) signpost that had the names of neighboring towns written in black and (**) saying we were almost at the bar. We went down a sloped area and walla! we had finally arrived.)  Except for seeing 2 or 3 cars and dodging into nearby brush to hide, the trip seemed mostly uneventful. Soon after we arrived, an IJCC counselor came with the van and drove us back to the Center. During the ride back, ** said that it took us longer to get to the bar than it should have (He had made the trip a few times). Some time after the AWOL trip, I began having UFO dreams and one dream was of a UFO invasion, a dream that was so realistic, I still remember portions of it 40+ years later. Fast forward early 1989 or early 1990 at the latest, I had the exact same 1979 UFO invasion dream. Then, around year (2000?) I had a vague visual memory of one moment of that 1979 night. In that memory, the four of us are standing on a stretch of road in the pitch dark except for a small, dark, circular UFO.  The craft was on or hovered close to the ground just off the road to my right.  As of this writing, I remember the lights as being bright blue and that they lit the immediate area. I stood on the road, closer to the right, and at least two of my companions stood across from me, a few feet away. I wasn't afraid, and I knew we were separated on purpose.  That is all I remember. Did something happen that night? Maybe. I now know that the Tibbits Road area was notorious for ‘strange' activity and that there was one or two other stretches of road near IJCC that the staff wished to avoid after dark.

Asked my to bring tools over to where he was (Bass Lake, IN) area  Close to hwy 10 and  hwy 35.   We gathered tools  We left North Judson and headed that way , my buddy and I. Only there for a min, to drop off the tools, we exited the driveway turning west on hwy 10 , now headed back home.  As soon as we were facing west.  We both said.   What the fuck is that… West and slightly North of us.   In the area of ToTo, IN ( yes that is a town)  were (2) two brass’y  colored lights.  4 – 8,000 ft up.  (rough guess)   So as fast as my mom’s  89 Ford escort could go. (Don’t Laugh) From Bass Lake area to ToTo we went, Running stop signs and about focused on these (2) two lights Once on Toto Road south  (somewhere around 399-33 S Toto Rd)  we where on the side of the road staring up at the two lights,  they were still just slightly north of our location now. Still 4 to 8,000 ft. up. Another car come flying up. Slams on his brakes and parks in front of us. He had see the (2) two lights, when he left work in LaPorte IN,  about 30 miles away.   So now there is 3 of us. Watching. Moments went by,  and for all directions cam chase planes.  5 or 6  coming in from all sides.  We can tell the planes were just that.  You could see the blinking lights.. as the planes came in closer.  The 2 lights.  In a split second were gone over the horizon. with just a streak of light.  ( the horizon in the direction of Chicago )  while the planes coming from that direction,   turned around.  Moments later,  the 2 lights where back… to nearly the same location.  The plans all turned back around again.   At this point seeing our fighter jets move like a turtle compared to streaks of light.   I said to my buddy and the other guy…. ""This is a fucking  clown show""  As in we the USA had nothing that moved even close to what the lights where.  Again, moments later,  the 2 light split in different directions,  GONE!!! I became a mechanical engineer through Purdue,  I have yet to see anything move, as such.  still to this day. and i am not 45-46  Years later, at dinner with my then wife , visiting my buddy in TX,  I said  hey,  what about those lights. He slaps his wifes shoulder, and says…..” I told you I wasn’t fucking crazy “   because clearly she did not believe him. But our stories match….  = )  I am blessed to have seen what I saw.

I noticed two boys directly across the street from us going the opposite direction on their bikes. One of those two boys had stopped and was pointing straight up into the sky. I was intrigued so I stopped my bike to look up.  My brother asked me, ""what are you doing?"" I said ""look!"" I was looking at a round metalic object about 10,000+ feet straight up. It was rotating in a curricular motion. It had a white ""bubble"" on the middle bottom.  It was not moving other than the circular rotating.  The object seemed blurry possibly due to it's distance and/or a heat source emitting from the object. My brother said ""what is that!"" And I immediately responded, ""a UFO!"" Suddenly, as if the object realized it could be seen, it went left and right at an extreme speed and then it went higher very quickly in a bit of a spiral motion as it did leave a chemtrail until it reached a certain altitude and then it went poof! Disappeared. No sound was heard.  Both sets of bike riders went their separate ways.  I have always wondered what made that boy notice it before I did.

Location was Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina in the summer of 1990.  Not sure about month or day.  Time was between 3 and 4 AM.  I oversaw an aircraft maintenance unit at the time and had reported to work early that morning to open the building before my people showed up to begin the day’s scheduled training flights.  I stepped out on the patio and remember noticing how nice the early morning weather was.  It was a full moon; a nice breeze was blowing in from the ocean pushing big white clouds along at various altitudes.  As I gazed up at the higher clouds, I noticed what appeared to be one of those clouds at a high altitude moving in the opposite direction to the other clouds.  It was moving terribly slow almost unnoticeable.  I thought to myself that it must have caught higher wind currents that were pushing it out to sea.  Satisfied with that explanation I was about to walk! back inside when it did something that changed my mind . It stopped in mid-flight as though someone had hit the brakes. I remember thinking how is this possible.  Then I realized what I was looking at.  It was not a cloud at all.  The object was reflecting on the clouds below it, the perfect camouflage.  I continued to watch the object and began to see that it was round as the clouds it was reflecting reached the edge of it.  There were no lights coming from it that I could see, and I could only see what I assumed was the bottom of the craft.  Shortly after I realized what it was, the most curious thing of this whole event took place. With military-like precision it deployed smaller versions of itself from the whole 360-degree circumference.  These smaller objects were the same size, moved at the same speed and their spacing was perfect. Each one appeared to have a control cable attached leading back to the base ship.  They continued to move in straight lines away from the base ship . I watched the event take place until a bank of clouds moved! in obsc uring my view.  After they cleared, I could no longer see any of the objects.  I remember looking at my watch and thinking that it lasted about 15 minutes.",2020-08-27T00:00:00,33.68315,-78.93953909574468

Close Encounter: 16 years after my first sighting. I had driven 1,000 miles from Spokane, WA where I was living to San Jose, CA where I grew up. I had stopped at Sacramento, CA to take a required 1 day class I needed to take. Only my mom and dad where living in the home and they had went to bed in the back of the house at 10:00pm. So I lay down to sleep on the couch in the livingroom which had two large uncurtained windows directly in front of me at my feet about 12 feet from my feet. As I lay there thinking about my day and many things on my mind still very much awake, able to hear the sound of traffic on the nearby road and fire truck sirens which were common, as well as the sound of the kitchen refrigerator and the nearby grandfather clock to my left, I noticed thru the large windows at my feet, what looked like helicopters in the distance traveling left and right with a large bright white search light going straight down from each one. I estimated 3 or 4 of these were in the air just from my view. These objects were flying at a low altitude of 500 ft. or so. Suddenly one of them changed direction and began to come straight toward me. I noticed there was no sound and that scared me because helicopters are loud. As it got closer, I slowly pulled the blanket over my head hoping not to be seen. Suddenly there was a very loud roaring sound kinda like an engine but like none I ever heard. More like an electrical hum. The room became very bright with an extremely white light that was so bright it was hard to look at. I was frozen in fear. The room being very loud and very bright. Couldn't see anything. Just bright white.  Suddenly, I saw them. Three of them. They were standing right next to me on my left. They were hard to see in the brightness of the white that filled the room. In that brightness, they appeared dark, possibly black with two large even darker eyes. Strange shaped head, long skinny arms with an elbow. Only two maybe three fingers. All three of them were reaching out toward my body touching or poking at me. And they were also looking at each other. I could hear nothing due to the lound electrical hum in the room. Suddenly, all the sound was gone. The three entities were gone. The room was still completely white. I could see nothing. Then a small round hole began to open up on the large window so that I could see the sky thru it. The rest of the room still bright white. The hole became larger and larger until the white was gone. As my hearing also began to return, I noticed I was beginning to hear the grandfather clock at my left and the refrigerator in the kitchen. But no street traffic, no sirens. It was very quiet and that confused me because 5 minutes ago, I was hearing the traffic. I turned to look at the grandfather clock and it read 3:00am. Five hours had passed in what felt like 5 minutes.  To this day I believe that I was abducted for 5 hours. My parents did not see or hear anything.  I have wondered since then if they implanted anything in me.",2020-08-27T00:00:00,37.3388420218894,-121.88970568836406

I am an amateur astronomer with over 20 years experience.  I am not certain about the date, I believe it was a Sunday night about 10:45  It was during a 3 day cold snap.  It was really cold out, super clear sky, I put bundled up, took my binoculars, I was standing on my back yard patio, I was just looking around the sky trying to decide what to look at.  It was so cold that I knew I wasn't going to stay out long.  I was facing east, and out of the corner of my eye, I saw motion in the sky, I then turned and looked right at the object that caught my eye.  It was a gigantic black rectangle.  It had no lights at all, it made no sound at all. It was a very quiet night.  It actually looked like a giant rectangle had been cut out of the sky!  It was blacker than the darkest black.  It moved so perfectly, with no effort, it moved across the sky in the most perfect straight line, unlike anything we see moving through the air.  A very educated guess of its speed...about 550 mph! , I went across my entire left to right field of view in about 12 seconds, The size is what makes this a truly life changing sighting. I estimate that the rectangle was about 1 whole mile in length by a half mile in height.  It was above my horizon about approximately between 48 and 55 degrees elevation. I estimate its altitude to be about 1 mile, at a distance between 2.5 to 3.5 miles away at the most.  As the rectangle was leaving my sight I walked around my house to watch it as it got further and further away until I couldn't see it anymore.  I was almost in shock with feelings of total awe. Just then, 2 airforce or navy fighter looking jets came roaring across the sky, following the same path as the rectangle.  The jets were going about the same speed , maybe a little faster than the rectangle, the jets were in that commonly seen formation near each other , one ahead of the other offset kinda diagonal.  The jets were long, skinny looking, pointy, very loud.  The jets were flying lower than most common airplanes that you see everyday. We! ll, I mu st have spent the next 3 hours staring up at the sky, called relatives that lived near by. I wrote down the time and date of course but lost that information .  about 4 years after this event, I did a simulation with a friend that owns airplanes.  I stood exactly where I was standing, my friends wife co pilot, texted me that they could see me as they were flying by me.  I watched his plane fly by.  He was at an altitude of 1 kilometer and at a distance to me of 1.5 kilometers.  And he flew by at a speed of 100 kilometers per hour.  With this information is how I think I have a pretty decent description of the size, speed, altitude, distance of the jets and the rectangle.  Nothing else happened for the rest of the night.  This was southwest Florida in a very quiet neighborhood, pristine sky that night.  I would give anything to talk to the jet pilots or whoever sent them up.  I welcome all that have seen anything similar.",2020-08-27T00:00:00,26.958632653061223,-82.32509999999999

I was 16 when I saw this craft.  It has been a little over a year since I’ve seen the craft.  But the odd thing is is that this was not the first time this craft was seen.  But those other accounts are for other reports.  6:30 AM CST  I am waiting at the stop where my bus picks me up for school.  Since I live near an airport it isn’t too uncommon to see some General Aviation craft fly in and out of the EVV airport.  At first I thought I was looking at a Cessna because the lights (or at the time I thought were lights) were positioned in the exact same layout as a Cessna’s wing lights.  But as I look closer I see no wings, no landing lights, and no navigation lights. When I suddenly notice that this is not a plane the craft comes to a complete stop over Maxwell Avenue, the road that connects Oak Hill road to Weinbach.  I keep my eyes on the craft. My bus arrives and I get in. I look outside of the windows to get a look at the craft as the bus now travels Northbound on Oak Hill but the craft is gone. My bus goes down Trail Drive and loops around it so it can go southbound towards Maxwell Avenue for the next stop. My bus continues it’s route. A buddy of mine gets on. We greet each other and he sits down next to ! me. My bus continues down towards Maxwell Avenue and then turns to go Eastbound on Maxwell. As I look out the windshield of the bus I see the craft landed on the ground or hovering over it slightly bobbing up and down. I was in total shock to see it sitting there and no one else noticing it! I guess to other people the two orbs looked like headlights of a vehicle sitting outside of this radio relay that sits on the right to Eastbound Maxwell Avenue. The craft stays where it is for a few seconds and then takes off going towards the Pigeon creek to the West. I look over at my friend and say, “Did you see that?” “No. What was it?” I jokingly say, “It was probably a drone.” And we laugh about it.  But now I realize after this incident that this craft was looking for something. It was possibly looking for me because earlier that school year in August of 2018 I was abducted. For all I know I’m part of something big going on behind the scenes out beyond our sphere of influence here on earth. For all I know this craft has been dispatched to spy on me as did another craft earlier this year in my report on 1/07/2020. And on that night that craft an hour later made MADAR node 153 here in Evansville go into alert status.  I will post the other reports on these 2 orbs.

I eventually came across something I thought was a refinery but now know its a huge rock with trees growing from it. So as im filming a square like object with rounded edges appears. It was moving around the speed of a boat maybe faster but it seemed to glide effortlessly about 10 to 15 feet above the water. The square had a dark outline in a cube shape but with rounded edges and was see through except the edges that outlined it. When it passed in front of the rock the outline seemed to darken as if the outlines were transparent or something. It hovered past the rock and about a mile further then eventually faded into the horizon.,2020-06-25T00:00:00,41.59848461538461,-81.51722153846153

The game was called spotlight which is basically just hide and seek but with a flashlight. One summer night in 1992 when walking home from playing spotlight I had an experience I’ll never forget I encountered a UFO. One by one our parents called out for us to come on home. While walking home with a friend I remembered that I had left my jacket on the fence in the yard we were using as our home base. I said goodnight to my friend and I turned around and went back for my jacket and my friend continued home to his house. As I grabbed my jacket from the fence I could feel and hear a very low vibration. I looked around and noticed that there was something above me in the sky. I could tell from the stars that it was blocking out that it was triangle in shape but it had no lights on it at all. Upon seeing this thing I immediately turned and started running up the street to my house as fast as I could. The strangest thing about it all was what was happening as I was running. It’s like something or someone was trying to control my emotions because one second I felt absolutely terrified and the next completely calm and at peace. It went back and forth like that the whole time that I was running back to my house which took a little more then 1 minute. When I got to my driveway I looked up again to see if it was still there and I noticed that it had followed me. This time there was a very small white light toward the center of the craft and as I looked down I noticed that I was lit up. It wasn’t like it had a spotlight on me because the light wasn’t yellow or warm as we would call it in these days and there was no circle of light on the ground beneath me. The only way that I can explain it is I was looking at myself as if I was in the daylight. I ran inside and locked the door. I have never experienced anything like that ever again. That experience stayed with me for a long time. I wouldn’t look up in the sky for years after it happened. I was so scared I wouldn’t even tell my mom about it in fear that something bad would happen if I did.,2021-12-19T00:00:00,,

Then 2 of the bright circles starting moving together, as though they wanted to come together as 1. The 3rd light started coming toward those 2 lights too but it was not moving in a straight line, instead it was bouncing around like being aloof. Then suddenly, when the 3rd light joined the other 2, all 3 lights came together and formed 1 bright light. Without a blink of an eye, it shots up to the skies and disappeared from our eyes.

As i hold my head between my hands and was saying wow that's unbelievable, i looked up and saw a metalik black greyish triangle right on top of us with 3 round cercle at each extramity. I couldnt believe it, at the same time it was scary. I managed to tell my wife to look up and she saw it too. And then it just wanished. No apparent engine, no smoke,no sound. actualy they was a sound but it was like wind sound, as a guess it was becauae of the speed it left.",2021-12-19T00:00:00,,

My mother and I were going home on a November evening in 2009. I was 14 at the time. We turned onto Grand Avenue, the street we lived on, at about 6pm. About halfway between the stop sign and our house I happened to look at my mom to talk and over her shoulder behind her in the distance there was a megalithic craft slowly traveling south towards the Gulf of Mexico parallel to Potter Tract Rd. I slap my mother’s shoulder and said, “LOOK!,” and I was absolutely terrified. She quickly pulled over and said, “Holy S**t,” and we watched it slowly travel further south. It was the color of brushed steel. It was very angular with rectangular features. The sides of it were dotted with windows of varying lengths. Through those windows along the side you could see figures moving about and walking like those windows belonged to a long hallway. The front of the ship had a very large rounded, protruding windshield. Under the first 1/3 of the ship there was a huge dome that hung down from its underside. The dome was partially translucent and was a mirrored-orange color similar to the color scheme available in some fishing style polarized sunglasses. I could also see within the dome that there were multiple levels of platforms and also figures walking around inside. At the back end of the craft there was some sort of propulsion device that looked like what you would see on modern rockets except it was about 100x the size. I am not exaggerating when I explain how large this object was. It was clearly very high up and I could take my hand and hold it up to the sky and not cover the craft from my vision with my hand which I could have done with ANY other known aircraft. It had to be miles long by my estimation. It was definitely big enough to carry thousands of humans as well as other aircraft. The speed of the object was what was so strange. It traveled at a snails pace. It was almost hovering. We could only tell it was moving because there were trees near us in the foreground and using these trees is the only way we could definitely tell the progress it had made. Of course I was terrified so I begged my mom to finish driving us home and “GET TO THE HOUSE,” so she did and I got out and ran inside quickly and had to drag her in because she wanted to stare at it. When we got inside I went to our houses front window and peeked through the blinds at it for about 5 minutes until we could no longer see it. I called my God-Father and told him. I do not remember the conversation. I also do not remember the next day and do not remember when I actually forgot about this. In 2012 I was stationed on Camp Schwab in Okinawa, Japan. One late night I woke up from a dream regarding this incident, but it felt like a distant memory. At that time it was morning in stateside so I texted my mother and asked her if she remembered this incident or if I was making things up and she said she did remember, but her description was of an object that looked like a carousel. Essentially, we went 5 years without speaking about this and I had completely forgot about it throughout that entire timespan. Since 2012 I have thought about this many times and can now remember it very clearly. I have searched online for anything remotely similar to my description of this object and have never found any description of anything remotely similar. Most searches turn up your typical geometrical shaped craft like square, rectangle, triangle etc. so I avoided reporting for fear that I would be perceived as crazy considering my experience goes well above and beyond all reports I’ve ever researched. This was not a basic craft that was seen sporadically moving. This was an intricate, megalithic, slow moving craft observed by two people simultaneously. My experience seems fantastical compared to other reports so I refrained from reporting.",2021-12-19T00:00:00,,

They were flying at an altitude normally too low for conventional aircraft.  Too slow for an airplane. . .almost as if they were gliding.  They made no sound. On the evening of January 12, 1997 around 11 pm I was at my girlfriend's house and went outside to try to start her car (it had been very cold that week and we had been trying to start it for a couple of days).  I went inside the car, tried to turn it on and it didn't start.  I got out of the car and two bright lights hovering over a set of trees caught my attention.  I knew that there were no lights (city or otherwise) that should have been there so I looked at them for a second or two.  They were really bright but at the same time kind of dull (hard to describe).  I moved a few steps away from the car and they started to move in a northeasterly direction.  When I first spotted the lights they were probably 1/4 to 1/2 a mile away.  I ran inside and told my girlfriend to come out and check them out.  She got on her boots and saw them but went back inside because it was at least 10 degrees below zero outside.  I ran out onto the street and followed their flight path.  They fl!ew from a southwest to northeast direction and were probably 60-70 degrees off of the horizon.  The two lights upon closer inspection appeared to be made up of more than one light, possibly five. . .occasionally they would blink (they blinked quickly, unlike any other airplane light I have ever seen)  The thing that struck me the most is how they stayed _perfect_ formation. . .not straying an inch from their formation.  It was as almost they were part of the same craft.  This might be the case, but if this is so that means that this craft was at least the size of 2 football fields.  They were completely silent.  Billings is set against a continuous series of cliffs which are about 60-100 feet in height.  In comparison to the Rims (as they are called) they were about 200 feet off of the ground.  They were flying too slow for any airplane that I know  of (plus, as i said they made no sound)  It was if they were gliding.  I ran up a side street and watched them pass over the rims!and pass just south of the airport, if not right over it.  I watched them glide off until they went over the horizon.  It was very strange, as the entire time I knew this was something that I have never seen before in person.  I tried to call the airport to confirm any unidentified aircraft but couldnt get through.

About 2:00 AM I started to see the sky get dark above us and I mean pitch black.  I remember looking up noticing the blackness. And then the next thing I remember it was about 5:00 AM just turning daylight.  And I was standing there with my eyes following a silver disc leaving the atmosphere.  There was about 3 hour's of missing time. That day we took the role's of film to be developed.  We picked them up and most of the pictures were just pure black. But we found a couple that had lights.  My girlfriend put them away. And we forgot about the encounter.  Somehow we were made to forget. Our memories had been tampered with. It was now the year 2013' sixteen year's later. And I stumbled upon the photograph's.  I took the 35mm print to our local drugstore. I used their Kodak picture maker machine.  Where I sized up the 35mm print to an 8×10.  I took the 8×10 and then scanned it into my computer. Where I was able to zoom in on the image. I have since then misplaced the Original 35mm print. Fortunately, I had the images saved on my computer.  The images that are attached are 100% authentic Extraterrestrial U.F.O. It is now 23 year's later and I have decided to share my story and the photographs. It has been quite an ordeal over the many year's. I just thought that I should share this information. Because people deserve to know the truth. Alien's are real.",2020-09-04T00:00:00,44.8141,-117.7453

They tend to have a recognizable sound.  The road that I live on is known for bad accidents so its not uncommon to hear them.  I usually go to the front door to see if its landing or just passing by.  That night was no different.  I first peeked out the window but when I didn't see anything I went to look from the front door. By the time I got to the door I no longer heard anything, at all.  Where I reside is a rural area. Aside from insects and animals it is very quiet.  So I thought it was strange that I heard a helicopter so close initially and now I no longer heard anything.  I took a step outside the door just to kind of look up and aound the sky but I didn't see anything.  Just as I was turning to go back in the house, I look to my left toward the back of the house.  That's when I saw it.  There was no sound at all. That freaked me out more than anything.  The aircraft was! moving the entire time. However it was moving so slowly I could likely keep up with it just by walking. I could only see the bottom due to my  vantage point and the fact that the sky was so dark. There were 4 lights on the bottom. At first glance I thought that the aircraft was triangular based on the position on the lights however after I looked  more closely I noticed that it was like a disk. I could see the outline of it. It was huge and flying not much higher than the 40ish foot tree that was in the front yard, or at least that is what it seemed. It was basically hovering. I stood there on edge as it moved overhead for what seems like forever as I tried to reason with myself and determine what it could be. I only  could come up with one conclusion but I felt crazy suggesting it could be a UFO. I was outside in the middle of the night, by myself. No one is going to believe me. My parents were asleep at this time. I ran back in the house, yelling mom. I banged on their d! oor and then ran back outside. It took maybe 10 seconds for me! to do t hat. However when I returned outside there was nothing, not a trace of the craft. I was terrified. By that time my mom was coming out of her room, half asleep and confused. I explained some of what happened she laughed and that pissed me off. But I also completely understood. I would have done the same. It was one of those see it to believe it type of things. I haven't seen anything like it since that night. My friend that was on the phone on hold the entire time still brings that night up. I had trouble sleeping, I was emotional, and all she could do was listen to me ramble on the phone about a UFO that no one else saw.",2020-09-04T00:00:00,38.5863,-76.7128

I do not remember the exact year, day, or time due to having memory problems about the event. Its like the harder I try to remember, the more it fades, like a dream . I do know for a fact though that this was not a dream as my sister witnessed it as well.  It was during the annual Perseid meteor shower, so July-August, between the years of 2006-2008 I believe. I know I was still in high school. This is what I remember clearly.  My sister and I went outside at around 2 a.m. to watch the meteor shower on our front lawn.  We were laying down in the grass and watching the meteors, they were very bright and numerous, when I noticed something in my peripheral vision.  I looked, at this point my sister was looking at it too, and literally on top of the tree line directly across from our driveway,  so very close and low, was a line of fixed lights that were changing colors.  They seemed to be attached to something that was not visible to our eyes.  The lights stayed in the same spot, they did not shift position at all. If whatever they were attached to was a craft, then it had the ability to hover without any movement or noise what-so-ever. It was completely silent. There was an unnatural silence about the world that was noticeable.  Any background noise was gone.  It was like we had been isolated in a bubble away from the rest of the world; that is the only way I can describe this complete lack of sound. We watched the lights move around what appeared to be an invisible, disc-shaped object for what seemed like a few minutes and then it was gone.  I blinked and it was gone.  I don't know if it just turned off the lights and was still there or if it took off, but it did it in the blink of an eye without making a single sound or leaving any trail or evidence. I'm not sure what happened after that. It was like it was immediately gone from my memory. I don't know if I talked to my sister about it, if we finished watching meteors, when we went back inside, I don't remember. When I did remember the incident, which was YEARS later, it was like I was remembering a dream from long ago and could not grasp the whole story or all the information. I only know it actually happened because my sister witnessed and remembers it too. She did not remember it though until I asked her about it years later and then she described to me the same thing I remembered, but that the memory was weird and fuzzy. Other experiences possibly worth noting were my only ""sleep paralysis"" experience in which I saw a being of light and weird geometrical bruising that appeared on my back as a child. The sleep paralysis experience was weird, because I thought that I had the ability to move, but when I tried I experienced so much pain throughout my body that I just held still as to not experience anymore pain. The whole time a very tall being made out of light was observing me. The bruising happened when I was maybe 10, I was camping in Nikiski, AK and woke up with geometrical(squares, rectangles, triangles) bruises covering half of my back. Not sure if these are related, but food for thought.",2020-09-04T00:00:00,60.66060000000001,-150.906

We all 4 made sure we were all seeing it, it made no sound whatsoever but it did appear to be spinning.  It was hard to make out if that was the case, because of how bright the glow was.  It slowly rose out of the woods until it was probably within 500-1000ft above the tree tops in which the object just hovered there completely silent, stayed hovering in place for an estimated time of 2-3 mins.  Then slowly flew out to the west until it was just a tiny dot in the sky.  I myself stood outside until well after dark and watched it until it faded completely out of sight.

Clouds were mostly Cumulus, with a few Stratus cruising across the sky West to East.  The wind was Westerly at 12-15 mph (I am a windsurfer and constantly watch clouds and weather). My girlfriend asked if I could see the odd ""striated patterns in the sky that looked like clouds"".  I could not see them.  Typically, she is very sensitive to everything, and sees and feels things I can't.  I replied I can't see but noticed I have an odd pressure in my right ear.  She said she had it too, only her whole head. I spotted a white balloon above the palm tree next door to the North.  It looked fairly far away and about 5-7mm across (in thumb and forefinger held up ""pinching"" it).  It was lit brilliantly by the sun dropping on the horizon.  It did not move in the wind.  I thought maybe the wind was calm at that elevation.  I asked if she saw it.  She did.  I pointed out that it wasn't moving with the wind.She agreed.  I went and got my Brunton Binoculars, and her Sunset Binoculars. With them I could easily see the ""string"" hanging from the white balloon.  She could see it with her's too.  How could the string be visible from this distance?  It would have to be a thick rope which a balloon could never lift.  Then we noticed the ""string"" looked kinked. It hung in a slight zig zag pattern under the balloon.  It also hung a bit to the East, like it was being blown by the wind to the East. We went outside to get a better look. The clouds and balloon began to have a orange-reddish hue on their western edges due to the sun getting low on the western horizon.  The balloon appeared to rotate 90 degrees showing a side-view which made it look like a piece of white rice.  Now the string was  not hanging but extending West-sideways-from the West end of the ""rice""  And then another kinked string extending East from the East end of the rice.  The pressure in my ear had increased.  The 2 strings became 6, 3 on each end originating from the 2 points where the 2 strings had come out of.  All 6 were kinked just as the hanging string had originally appeared.  Then tiny-at-first white spots appeared at the outboard ends of the kinky strings.  As the 6 white spots grew they started to look like 6 little puffy Cumulus Clouds.  Then they grew together into 2 bigger clouds, one on the East, one on the West. My girlfriend and I were discussing this the whole time, she saw exactly what I saw. As the 2 clouds grew they engulfed the rice (or ""Tic Tac"" as I've seen recent descriptions), hiding the rice completely.  It was then I notice a cloud Northwest of the ""rice cloud"", which also wasn't moving with the wind.  This cloud suddenly cruised Southeast to the rice cloud and engulfed it.  The now-1-cloud rapidly flew  away straight North and disappeared over the horizon within 5 or 10 seconds. Summary:  The original round appearance only let me see one of the hoses which had been deployed to squirt out the cloud-material.  When it rotated sideways I could see there were hoses on each end which spread apart into 3 on each side.  The kinked points were the hinges by which the hoses were folded inside the object.  As the clouds were emitted the object appeared to deflate some looking less full...of cloud stuff.  Why didn't it blow with the wind?  Where did the other, much bigger cloud come from, and why didn't it blow with the wind? Once the rice was totally covered the bigger cloud went across the wind to meet up with it before exiting North.  At night I see planes flying south.  It takes 5 minutes for them to cover the distance the cloud did in seconds. I went inside and immediately wrote this description down.  At some point our ear and head pressures had gone away.",2020-09-04T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

We were stringing lights at the front gate with a ladder propped up in the bed of a pickup truck facing east. When I turned toward the west to grab another strand, I saw the lights approximately 150 yards away, each appearing to be the size of my tractor. I hollered for my help to head for the barn and I took off running on foot as the lights went out one at a time. Before I reached the barn, I heard a very loud sonic boom. My two employees reached the barn shortly afterwards and said they saw blue lights shoot straight up and streak at an unearthly speed south down the canyon. My father was a Navy fighter pilot in Korea and Vietnam where he was CO of the first squadron of A-7 Corsairs. So I am familiar with the sound a jet makes breaking the sound barrier.

I watched them until they disappeared, thinking they were possibly lanterns someone let go I thought nothing of it.  I started to turn away when I saw two more come over the mountain again.  I grabbed my phone and began to record.  These objects went in the same pattern as the previous two and disappeared in the exact same location.  My cousin came out and began watching them with me.  Two more appeared and did the exact same thing, then two more.  His wife called him and we began explaining to her what we were seeing. She looked up from her location, which was closer to the area in which they were coming from and saw the same thing. She said there wasn't any noise but she was quick to pass them off as helicopters or drones until she saw more coming over the mountain and began to really watch them. Not one of us heard any noise coming from these objects, they were not blinking, they all followed the same path and disappeared in the same location in the sky. I have one previous experience when I was around 8 years of age and I was with my father and brother. These looked different from the one we had seen then but it too was in Highland. That one was the most interesting thing I had ever seen. It bounced all over the sky, continually changed color and when it finally disappeared after 10-15 minutes of watching it, it ""exploded"" into every color of the rainbow. I thought twice before posting this but as I am watching ""Unidentified,"" the videos they are showing right now are of the same objects that my cousin and I saw that night and it gave me more confidence to come forward.

As I walked out the door, a bright orange glowing object to my west immediately caught my attention. It was just hovering in place. Almost as if we were staring at each other for a moment. It was close enough I could see a sphere shaped object, with a very bright orange glow emerging from it. I heard no engine, no noise whatsoever ever.  It  was as quiet as the night sky can be. My husband and I live in a small rule town with no traffic, and very secluded.  I was so caught off  guard and could not believe what I was looking at. It was nothing I had ever seen before. I stared at this for probably 15-20 seconds.  As I continued to stare I called out my husband’s name at least 3-4 times, getting louder each time. Once I started to scream for my husband, this object starts to move north in a very slow speed. As it’s moving it appeared to be getting smaller. It moved slowly between my house and our neighbors house, making its way out into the front of my house. Once it made its way to the  front of my house , it immediately,  in unexplainable speed, with what appeared to be  in a very precision like maneuver, shot straight down, turning around, in like a dive and curve back upwards motion and then shoots back up, disappearing into the East sky. My husband never heard me yelling his name, and he was out side under our deck putting tools away.  After the initial shock of seeing this orange glowing sphere like object in my back yard, I then grabbed my phone to try and get a video. By the time I got my phone and my video camera on, it had just made its way to the front of my house. It was so dark outside, and this object now seems more like an orange dot, I managed to get a video and a picture. The video shows a orange dot, popping out of site, and then back insight again. You can see it turn and make its way back up and disappearing to the East. I had to play it back in slow motion and zoomed in. When doing that you can actually see this objects shape as it’s maneuvering very fast.  I can’t stop wondering what this could have been. I even go back outside periodically, around the same time of night in hopes to see it again. I have not yet seen it again. .",2020-08-27T00:00:00,39.6591,-91.7208

It was definitely a huge distance away, and very long. The object seemed to consist of maybe 15 to 20 round lights clustered together to form a lightening rod shape at first, then a straight line. I compared the size of one of the lights to the star and it seemed that they were of similar size.  The lights were very near together but could see space between them at the top and bottom.

Please do not publicly post or disclose this information. If anything - I'd be happy to censor this information so as to not disclose the area with which it was reported. St. George is close enough. I have a sensitive job.  At 11:45AM [approx] Tuesday morning, I decided I wanted to perform CE5 protocol, and take the process seriously [had thought about it before, but never took it seriously enough to try it]. Asked girlfriend if she was interested in giving it a try, so we wrote out what we would've liked to see/experience in an effort to build the intention and, hopefully, manifest the desired outcome [inexplicable lights in the sky]. Live in St. George, but my parents live in Dammeron Valley, so we went up to their house and borrowed an ATV to go up and out of the valley to a more remote location. At (approximately) 9:15PM we arrived at a suitable destination in time to watch the sunset [two photos attached]. At (approximately) 9:45PM, we meditated for (approximately) 15 minutes in an effort to (again) build the intention. At (approximately) 10:00PM, we stopped and I continued to scan the horizon North to South, while facing East (facing Pine Valley Mountain-range). At 10:04PM, I looked over my left shoulder after scanning South to North and witnessed a bright object headed our direction moving from the North-West to the South-East (light looked like Airplane headlights - didn't blink or flash). At (approximately) 10:05PM an incredibly large [football-field to city-block sized] craft in the shape of a boomerang appeared over the top of us, suddenly, moving from the (true) South to the (true) North. To the best of my ability, I'd guess it was only a hundred feet above us, and it moved incredibly slowly - no more than 15-20mph. The craft had 7 distinct greenish-white lights along the inner portion of the wings. Our discernment of craft-shape is due to it eclipsing the night sky, accompanied by the limited remaining light from the recent sunset [almost nominal]. The craft was distinctly blacker than the night sky, and the lights themselves were dimly lit, but visible for a few miles. It proceeded northward along the firebreak and met up with what seemed to be the craft I had first noticed coming from the North-West. The white light from the Northwest moved in an intercept-like position in front of the larger craft, and proceeded to spiral [up and down] in front of it at the same speed. We watched both of them creep forward until they fell behind the horizon.  There was no sound prior to its appearance, and there was no sound until it had sufficiently drifted closer to the mountain range to North. An incredibly low-toned frequency was heard echoing off the walls of the mountain, but was not totally audible until then [2-3 minutes into the sighting].  I had been scanning the Southern horizon for, at least, 5 minutes before it arrived - and for a half hour longer before our meditation - it appeared on us out of nowhere... it was right over the top of us... we were looking at the middle of the craft.  What have we experienced? I didn't expect it to work, let alone.. this well. I know what a B2 is, I know what a stealth fighter is - I've seen them in person. I didn't think anything that big could fly... let alone silently and slowly... it's been difficult to integrate this experience.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,37.2629,-113.6962

I live on a farm, and the mail box is about 100 yards from the house. As I left my front door, I noticed that the air was very still and it was an exceptionally beautiful calm early morning. The temperature was perfect, I didn't need a sweater. I looked up in the sky and noticed Mars, the red planet near the moon and thought it was so very red and bright. After finishing at the mailbox, while walking the same way, but in the opposite direction, I noticed a blinking calendrical object flashing red, blue, green, yellow, and white lights. It stayed in place hovering beyond the West hills of Fernley. After observing it for about 10 minutes, I found it odd, because it was not moving and just hovering. The night before, there had been unusual activity in the sky over Fernley, and my farm. There were several military helicopters buzzing over my farm, a low jet, and a C130 military plane and those a! re just the ones I noticed... who knows? Regardless, this object just stayed there hovering. I awoke my husband and he joined me to view this object. It stayed in the same spot for 40 minutes while we wondered what this object could possibly be. We used our binoculars to look closer and the lights seemed to be moving around the object. After my husband went back to bed, I continued watching, and it moved very slowly to the North and toward Reno. I thought, good .. go away, your not supposed to be here.

The second one was over Malibu while night fishing with my kid,  I did not report, but I do have a video attempting to capture the object and you can hear it in my 6 year old's voice that what we were seeing was not like any aircraft flying at night we have ever observed.  I thought it was Mars and it ended up changing color and began flying away with typical aircraft flashing lights after being in that position for 10 min.  Wasn't enough for me to report imo. On 06/10/20 around 6:30pm - 7pm while exercizing at a neighbor's house, I noticed a white circle in the sky at what appeared to be a similar height that you would see satellites travel at night. Pointed it out to my workout partner and I told him maybe it's a sta r(which would be rare to see in L.A. while it's day light). Told him to grab his binos to see if it's a star or maybe even a planet..  Was difficult to find in the glasses, but while moving from glass to eyes on the blue/white flashing circle/orb, we spotted more (orange and white stationary,higher altitude, fade out/in and one back to back triangle looking formation) They appeared to fade in and out or maybe the angle of the sun plus how high they were. There were white circles and orange, and I only captured the orange on the binos.  At this point I told my buddy I'm getting one of my telescopes, either the Orion xt6 or the Orion xt10i so we can get a better look. 15 min later back with the Smaller telescope and we couldn't spot them with the naked eye.  After 5-10 min searching, another object appeared from the South heading north, but appeared to be a bit lower in altitude than a satelite, but way higher than any planes would fly.  I was able to train my scope on this, and it looked like a white cloud/balloons spinning compared to tbe sigle circle faint objects.  Also, following the object in the telescope was similar to following a planet as far as speed. Any feedback with answers/ideas on this experience or the last report would be appreciated.

As soon as I got home I dragged my mom to the car in order to show her the moon. We started driving around the neighborhood, the city, but we could not find the moon. Then my mom told me to turn into a random residential neighborhood which we have never been able to find/remember for or since. That's when we saw it. Our car was parked and we were inside, but it was maybe double the distance of the roofs on the adjacent household. It had what looked like to axis of brightly flashing rapidly rotating orbs around its side. its shape was not an orb when we saw it. my mom pulled her camera out right away, but the orb result seems like the camera wasn't capable of correctly capturing it because of its bizzare spectral almost plasma like maneuverability, it was very hard to imagine something solid was inside of that orbing light and it's behavior. although when we first saw it I was hovering there and didn't leave at first. I was at first almost scared shitless but since I was there with a witness and I was seeing something that would change my conception of reality forever afterwards. I'd never seen anything move in those directions instantly or seem to propel itself by changing shape. When it left, it actually did something totally crazy, it shot like a dark straight into the ground like a light and then it was just gone. Later, I unconsciously started drawing a picture of my experience and the picture at the end is what I did. I had a strong hunch it was so disorted because me and my mom were flat landers looking at an object in an extra dimension, one outside time. so we couldn't see the real scale of its shape and it bound to seem to be moving by an impossible mechanism. And actually, I did take time to learn about about conceptualizing dimensions in much more lateral and familiar language and understand , I feel, because what I seen made me capable of imaging. I've done a lot of research into that subject because of that.

We were at about the same altitude on the other side of the valley, so it seemed that we were witnessing the side of the craft. It was hovering above the hill on the opposite side of the river valley. We were driving on route 69 heading east into Warren, PA. We only saw it for about 15 seconds and it was at dusk so there was room for error, but we are both confident of what we saw to this day. Really weird side note, we both had this strange feeling about 5 seconds before we actually saw it. It was felt like fear, but good. Like excitement but deeper and extremely brief. She will tell you the same thing. So I know that sounds bonkers, but that's the experience we had. The craziest thing about this event is that it wasn't the first UFO sighting I have had. Another one happened about 2 years prior in the SAME LOCATION. Me, my brother and two of our friends all in the same car. We witnessed a large black Triangular craft in the exact same location! We were driving North, and when we came around the last bend where the city limits are- we witnessed a large triangular black object, with 3 white lights in each corner, hovering directly above the road we were on, seemingly waiting for us because it was motionless until it was directly on our field of view through the front windshield. It then started to match the speed of the car (while rotating slowly) This lasted about two minutes, we never slowed down and it always stayed in our view like it wanted to be seen. We continued to drive north on Conewango ave watching in awe the entire time, before it suddenly shot off in northern direction at an incredible speed. No sound at all. I will be filing that report along with this one, I wonder if you have any database for multiple events in the same location. So with these two events the number of witnesses including myself is a total of 5, and we still talk about these events to this day.

Clear black valley sky, there wasn't much light here at the time, and there still isn't. I was facing North, when my peripheral caught a bright light approx. 20 degrees east off the ground floor. I may have thought it were a low flying airplane very close by, except what happened next. I only saw it in this state for 1/2 a second tops. The ""craft"" may have been stationary at the time. Maybe it was gaining power (light) before take-off which caught my attention. The craft looked very close by in that state, maybe 1/8th a mile away, but it could have been 3 miles away for all I know, hard to tell because it was dark. If I had to guess it was above the Carson river or pasture. Then the craft took off approx. 70-75 degrees north at unbelievable speed. One moment it looked like the low flying craft described, the next the light was as bright as a high altitude jet, the next like a satellite & gone. But it never changed course, always 70-75 degrees north on a straight line. I steadily watched every bit of it under that sky for a total of 6-7 seconds. Recognizing that kind of speed so to speak, IMO it entered space in perhaps 5 seconds, and I only lost site of it because of distance & space dust. Think of the speed better than a falling star, only in this case it was going up. There was no trail or sound. I thought perhaps if I added the record tonight it might match up with other reports for the same thing. Good luck, thank you.",2021-12-19T00:00:00,39.16921421319797,-119.75176954314722

We were out there for a while so our eyes had acclimated to the dark and we were just talking and hanging out when we see a grouping of lights that kinda just looks like a low airplane but we didn’t hear anything. It was kinda headed in our direction so someone pointed it out and it wasn’t really that high in the sky. As it came our way we started to hear a humming kind of buzzing sound almost like a drone. Then as it got closer we thought it was just a drone because it had 3 green lights on and was triangular shaped. It was really dark so all we could see was the lights in town and the stars. As it kept getting closer it became apparent it wasn’t a drone because it just kept getting closer and was very large. If I had to guess I’d say 100 feet across. It very slowly made its way over us, almost seeming to slow down when it was over us. We were all just kinda of freaking out and all in amazement because none of us could explain what we were looking at. The lights weren’t overwhelmingly bright by any means and just looked like dull green lights in the corners of it’s triangular shape and no light coming from the body of the craft itself. You could only see the black silhouette of the craft blocking the stars and the dull green lights in the corner. I couldn’t make anything out on the silhouette. When it was at its closest I’d say it was probably only 100 to 150 yards above us and it wasn’t very loud, just a kind of dim, dull, hum and kind of buzzing sound almost like a drone but muffled. I’m not really a big believer of sightings and all that but I still can’t explain what we saw and all my friends who were there still talk about it. I only just heard about the site and the date I gave is definitely wrong but it was probably during that summer that we saw it. Just writing about its kinda giving me some paranoid kind of chills. Please don’t disregard. Thanks you",2021-12-19T00:00:00,42.08283608247423,-76.80816185567011

About 3 years ago I was a tow trucker out of Owen Sound Ontario. It was not uncommon for me to be up and down Southwestern Ontario from the cities on a daily basis. A memory I have kept private for a long period of time is one I cannot explain and have finally decided to report. I don't remember the exact date but it was a summer night. I always listen to music and jam when I'm driving. I wa soperating a GMC C5500 Flatbed towtruck. It was yellow and I have many pictures of it. One night after a day of trucking I was taking highway 6 Norrh late at night. It was either highway 6 or highway 10 as they both lead north to Owen Sound where I could get to my bed for the night. I did not see any flying objects. What I experienced that night was unexplainable. The bwst way to explain it is to ask if you understand what it is like driving at night. For the most part you are in darkness. Except when going through towns or busy roads and intersections that are well lit. I DID NOT notice the light until it disappeared like somebody flicked a switch. One moment my truck was encircles by bright white light as if I was in a well lit city with a spotlight on me. In the next moment it was complete blackness around my truck. I was in shock and surprised so I pulled over. There were no lights behind me. I was not on a well lit road. The light did not scare me however. When I was in the light I felt secure and safe. When it went out I felt bare and exposed The craziest part was the last part of the drive I could remember was being on the busy Kingsway coming out of the city. Over an hour had passed on my clock and I was much closer to home then I could believe. Over an hours worth of driving was behind me. I was further north on the highway. In summary a bright light disappeared and I became aware of the knight itself and a duration of time gone by without being able to recall any moment of it.,2021-12-19T00:00:00,,

I brought it to my friends attention and we watched a single object come out of the east, travelling west over the ridge of a small mountain. There was only one object. It was small and luminous, but not very bright. It looked about three times the size of a regular star. I would have considered it to be a conventional aircraft, had it not been for the way it moved. It was extremely fast. It came in, slowed down somewhat, and then accelerated. Also, its path was a little erratic, not very smooth. After about only five seconds I lost sight of it. It could have disappeared behind the ridge, but to me it looked like it simply vanished. My friend and I are both senior psychology students at Arizona State University.

It hovered for at least 10 minutes, then it faded quickly into black. At approximately 7:15 p.m. on the evening of January 21, 1997, I was driving toward my home in Blackwell, OK, when I glanced in the sky.  In the west/southwest sky, somewhere between 9-10 oclock I would estimate, I spotted an object.  Thinking it was a star at first, I looked back at the road.  Then, thinking to myself that it looked larger than a star, I looked again.  I couldn't get a really good look at it while I was driving, so I stopped in a church parking lot to watch it.  The object was larger than a star or planet.  I watched the object for just under 5 minutes, in which time it did not move.  It was a golden colored object with a red ""tail"" hanging to the left.  The red light at the end of the tail occasionally appeared to be flickering.  I went to my parents' home and they both went outside.  Both viewed the object.  We do not believe that it was a helicopter, due to the fact that the lights were large enough that if it were, we would have heard the noise.  We heard no noise at all.  My mother and I returned to the house to gather a few things and get in the car to drive away from the town and view the object.  However, when we went back outside, the object was gone.  Another witness we spoke with said she was watching as it disappeared, and it just faded into black, as if it were traveling away from her at a high rate of speed.  It did not appear to move from that position, so if it was moving, it would have had to have moved away at the same angle that we were viewing it from.  It did not just disappear all of a sudden, it was very bright (brighter and a little larger than the average star)and then began to get smaller and fade into black.  We proceeded to drive into the country and we never got sight of the object again.  We have not gone public with this story, but we would like to know what it was.

A telescope revealed a round shape. I observed what I took to be a satellite, until it shifted direction, and then stopped.  It was slightly brighter than the brightest stars in the sky, and not an unusual color.  It would hover for awhile, then move, sometimes appearing to spin in circles.  I first looked at my watch at 19:11, after having watched the object for perhaps 10 minutes.The object hovered in basically the same part of the sky for over three hours, at times appearing to drift, and then bring itself back to where it was before.  It often just hovered perfectly still, and looked like a star. It was roughly overhead of Alta, very high, a little  to the northeast.  Witnesses who saw it move included a member of the Alta Fire Department, a dispatcher for the Alta Marshall's office,And two members of the astronomical society at the Hansen Planetarium in Salt Lake.  They happened to have a nice 3inch wide telescope, and were photographing the moon.  With a higher powered eyepiece, the telescope showed the object to be pefectly round, with a darker round circle in the center.  I think the telescope was about 12000x, if I recall correctly.  The object was absolutely still in the telescope.I think the image in the telescope was consistent with looking up at the underside of a perfectly round flying saucer.  No lights were apparent on the object.  It appeared to be reflecting light from the sun which gave it the appearance of a star to the naked eye. Conceivably, this was some type of satellite being put into a fixed orbit, except for the erratic motion.  With my arm outstretched, it moved the length of my thumb, at the most.  I would like more information on types of satellites.  Personnel at the Hansen Planetarium weren't aware of any satellites that can behave like that.

The year was 1987.  I was twelve years old visiting my grandparents dairy farm in (Viola) rural southwest Wisconsin.  We had just finished a hot day of working in the fields and were relaxing on the back porch at dusk when we noticed a bluish white light moving in between the thick trees of the forest view we so often enjoyed from the back deck of their farm house throughout the years.  My first thought was someone with a flashlight, but that would soon prove to be false, it stayed constant.  As we sat there viewing this oddity, my grandfather, who had served his country in the Navy in WWII and seen everything with an unwavering ability to be brave, suddenly had an inability to explain what we were witnessing and his fear of this unknown was when I knew we were seeing something strange indeed.  As this “orb” of light (for lack of better words) made its way into the open field from out of the steep! valley filled with trees, this thing never deviated speed or distance from the ground, nor cast any sort of ambient light on the ground surrounding it.  It was in itself a light.  Almost self contained, if that makes sense.  Just unexplainable.  It just kept moving in one direction.  All at once this orb of light, which was at this time some 250 to 300 yards from our position on the back porch, turned and was heading right in our direction.  As it got closer I decided I’d get up and get a better look as it got closer.  My grandfather, visibly worried told me not to move a muscle.  I sat back down as we watched this thing pass in between his house and the pole shed where he kept all of their farm equipment, and out of sight.  To this day I’ve never seen anything like it and have never found any sort of an explanation for what we had witnessed.",2020-07-31T00:00:00,43.4921,-90.6432

The county road runs east and west the farm was south of the road. As I was driving I seen a light beam coming from atop of the trees in the pasture shining to the ground. I slowed down and stopped on the county road rolled down the window and put my head out to look at the object.

I was a Latin student (the ""dead"" language, not... you know.)  We had a high school team competing in a game called Certamen -- very much like the game show ""Jeapordy.""  After school was let out for the summer, we continued to practice, most of the time at our teacher's [huge, nice] house.  But we had a few practices at my house and those of the other three teammates. Sorry for that bloviating intro...  One night I was driving myself, my brother and my best friend Jason back from our teammate Erin's house.  The stretch of road we were on was not lit by streetlights, so it was really, really dark. [And a hand-me-down '76 Honda Civic can't really light things up well. I did love that car!]   So we were on a dark road, and I don't remember which but either my brother or my friend looked out of the window and he was like ""What the f*** is that thing?  I had no clue what they were talking about -- I was concentrating on driving with virtually no visibility. When I finally looked up to see what the heck was the matter, there was a large, black triangular 'something' flying right above us.  Well, that road had a lot of tall trees, so probably the craft were flying at like 100 feet.  It had one white light on each of the corners or vertices.  I think they were constant instead of blinking, but I had two of my favorite people in my car, so still: drive safely. Whatever it was, it was following my car, at 40 or 45 mph, whatever the speed limit was. I know of no aircraft which can keep aloft at that slow of a speed [and I'm an aircraft-nerd].  I think even the single-engine Cessnas have to maintain 70-75 or they'll stall out and drop. The thing was way too big to have been a helicopter, plus it made no noise that I could hear.  It hovered above us almost all the way to my friend's house, which was in a very well-lit neighborhood.  As soon as we got into the lighted area: whoosh! No more shadow-craft shadowing us.

I pointed it out to my sister and grandmother but for some reason they could not see it.  I told them “it right there” and they both said “I don’t see anything”.  They then became silent while I continued to watch it.  It was traveling at a cruising speed, it made no sound, and I was the only one that could see it even though it passed right over the 3 of us.  It was close enough that I could see the underlying detail of the ufo.  I saw a circular light in each point and a circular light in the middle of the triangular ufo. I watched it for minutes while my sister drove the golf cart and I drew a picture of it immediately when we got back to my grandmother’s house.

I took over 100 photos over 2+ hours and later looked at these photos.  Nearly all of them have lights floating right above the treeline. Several of the photos show 3 or 4 small, round flying objects, sometimes very clearly, and these are producing some of the lights. 2 photos CLEARLY show a triangular type craft, greenish/yellow in color, that is floating directly above pine trees.  I did not hear anything but I did have a distinct, creepy feeling of 'being watched', so much so that I went back into the house a couple of times. These photos were taken in succession and you can see that the craft has moved in position from one photo to the next.  The most disturbing aspect of these photos is you can see that this 'craft' is emitting a red smoke or spray and spreading over the trees below it. Several of the photos include a triangular shaped, brilliantly lit object floating directly above the ground basically in the middle of nowhere.  It is floating above the ground surrounded by trees.  It changes it's position from photo to photo so it is definitely moving.  The colors are brilliant white, reds, blues, purples and yellows.  Sometimes it is parallel with the ground, other times it is vertical with the more pointed end facing down to the ground. I am concerned as to what these are, who 'manages' them, what are they doing, what is that red spray being emitted over the trees, etc.  I really REALLY hope that someone in the government looks into this because of those very questions.  What is it's purpose and what is the impact of that red spray on the environment, wildlife and people in the area??  I will be happy to provide the photos if someone will look into this. I have submitted this information and several photos to many agencies and am disappointed that no one seems concerned.  If I can take 3 days worth of photos and have a hundred or more photos all containing these lights in one form or another, how frequently are they there?? I visited this friend's off grid home 3 years in a row.  Each time staying 2 to 4 days and each time I got up to take photos of the sun rise.  Each year, I had exactly the same type of results in my photos.  I have overwhelming evidence of some kind of phenomena going on in that area and no one seems to give a damn.  Doesn't our government have any concerns regarding security? Environmental safety issues?  People's safety?  Anyways, there ya have it.

My mother, brother, and baby sister were living with my great-grandmother and we all shared one bedroom.  My brother and I shared a bed, and across the room, my mother slept with the baby.  I wouldn't say I woke up; it was more like I was summoned to get up.  I didn't even think to resist and I was not scared.  I slept against the wall, so I had to crawl over the iron bedpost at the foot of the bed so I wouldn't wake up my brother. In my Fruit-of-the-Loom under ware, I went out of the room, through the short hall and dining room, and into the kitchen. There I unlatched the backdoor and stepped out onto the cold concrete steps that led down into the backyard.  And there, waiting for me, was a giant head hovering over the yard about 10 feet off the ground. It was glowing in a softly wavering greenish color. It did not move, but faced me as I felt compelled to set on the concrete in the darkness. I knew it was not human because the top of it's head was very large in portion to the lower face, like it had a giant brain. It was bald and I saw no hair anywhere. From what I could see through the glow, the small, expressionless face below the massive cranium was human-like but not fleshy soft; more like skin covered skull. It's eyes were all black and it's mouth was no more than a very thin line.  I was not scared because the head did not want me to feel fear. In fact, I was very calm and very much at ease. There was nothing I could do anyway. And somehow I knew that the head was not physically real, but was a projection of material, and that the real physical thing the head was showing was somewhere else and not just a hovering head.  Then the head began to send thoughts into my mind without moving it's mouth or changing any features at all. What happened next is very difficult to explain because there are apparent and real factors of time involved.  I'll do my best in bullet form what it showed and communicated:  1. It show me a wide river and dense bunches of fruit trees lined the far bank. And people were in those, but I could not see them. I knew there where there eating the fruit. The head told me that the people there were at the start of my bloodline and that his kind had been watching and guarding my line all the way down to me. It said (expressed) that they were watching over other bloodlines, other families all over the world. It said I would meet some of them when the time is right.  2. It told me that there is an invisible war going on in humanity and that powerful and evil creatures (their enemies) ruled the world. It said my bloodline and the others were (and I'll say it this way because I can now) at the front edge of human development, that we are the highest level of human development. They made sure that all my generations were matched with the possessor of some pure blood, not mutated. It said my blood was very close to pure as can be in all of humanity. It said there were very few like me and that they guarded and protected all of us in preparation to battle the evil human agent fighting for their enemy.  3. It said I will not understand many things until I am much older and that I would be taught what I could handle and be developed over time.  The next thing I remember was awaking the next morning. I don't remember going. back to bed. The big. head. visited me several times, two or three nights. From then until I was 14, I knew I was being follow by something so small that I couldn't see it as it was always nearby. And being a child I gave imagined it was a tiny van like Scooby Do, the cartoon kids I liked watching o Saturday.  I was different after that. My mind began to change and expand until I was able to see reality completely different that everyone around me.",2020-08-06T00:00:00,32.326774803149604,-90.19263976377952

We experienced this for 3 consecutive nights and those things  were  entering from the window of our bedroom ,a loud strong wind with noise in ears like we experience in planes whilst descending from high quote . Those sphere seemed intelligent as one lead all the others and kept the same distance , every day ,as I tried to get closer to them ,to touch them but  they moved away naturally throughout the apartment .I didn't feel any kind of treat and we were all sobers of course! My dear grandma was there now dead and my ex Parisian girlfriend that I don't have any more contact and was sick at the time a long term sickness...and  I d like not to enter in further detail about it  All my family woke up at times the sounds entered the apartment and  were so loud that we woke up all of us and wandering, standing and  meeting in the corridor whilst stearing at watch other with fear apart of myself,the only guy , which I was  fashinated about that wonderful ""things"".

The following morning she told me all this ,but  I don't recall because obviously I was asleep and I'd an information I didn't need to process in my brain ,somehow ,it was a strange feeling ,still now. I have the same vivid sensation ..I didn't need to wake up and that's it !

I don't know about my ex ...and if she is still alive ,really .  Then after all these 3 nights  we , together with some friend of mine went outside the city s skirt up to the hills (known and recon as  ""UFO spots"") to hunt for those lights in the sky ,and we saw  white lights , bigger going in the sky orizzontally several times  ,but although they were white ,I don't remember exactly if it was true ,or just an ""illusion"" post event  related at what we experienced few metres or even inches from us ,inside the apartment .Of this I cannot be sure but my friends even nowadays say that we saw the lights..  I have never really told this to anyone apart same friends or occasionally theme relating conversations about this ""mystery"" whish isn't no more to me as I have seen them few inches away from my body ,so I believe we are not alone and there is much more.  Finally my Italian"" poem""ends here but this is REALLY what I have ,we have lived, saw we our eyes and ears ,as far as my mental sanity  is concerned this has  happened and I would be delighted to know more or share info as I have no fear but no lucrative interest .

There was no wind today, so I was confused as to how it could be something that large blowing in no wind.  It moved slowly at first, but after 2 minutes, I could no longer see it.",2020-04-09T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

It was about 10:30 pm and my daughter and I where in our outside hot tub when all of a sudden we saw the most amazing and longest shooting star we have ever seen, after seeing this we started talking about UFO’s and my many experiences in Mexico before.  After a few minutes she went indoors and I remained in the hot tub, just lying down looking at the beautiful night sky full of stars… it was then that I saw a huge triangular shape, almost transparent, see- through UFO,  it had small triangles within, it must have been  at least 100 meters of the ground and it was slow and steady, I saw it fly above me and then just flew away…  I felt mesmerized and amazed,  I felt a little bit of fear , but the fear quickly went away, and after a few more minutes I came back indoors and told my wife and daughter about the incident. I just wanted to leave some kind of report of my experience last night, thank you for taking the time to read this. I have had many more experiences with UFO’s in Mexico, but this was my first time here in Canada after 9 years living here. Now, I know they’re here , for some reason… this is very interesting!

Caught my attention when I noticed two unusually bright ""stars"" moving slowly and in unison across the sky.  When I looked directly at it, I could see that the ""stars"" were actually lights on either end of a craft. in between the two bright lights was a row of very dim lights on the body of the craft. these lights were so dim that i could not see the outline of the craft if i looked directly at it: too dim to be picked up with my cones. but i could make out the craft attached to those two bright lights with my peripherals. My roommate also saw it and he said there are no drones that look like that. It was 1/3 to 1/2 the size of cassiopia in the sky. If it were a 747 then it would have just taken off. that is how large it appeared in the sky. of course, it was mostly likely much higher than 10,000 feet because of how hard it was to make out the form of it and the fact that it was completely silent (meaning that it was probably a very very large craft). What i saw was the back end of the craft, because as I watched it the lights moved north slightly but mainly those two bright lights on the ends got dimmer and closer together until they disappeared, meaning the ship was flying higher and higher in the sky until it was no longer seen. the lights were still quite far apart when they faded completely from view. all of this from when i first saw it to when it disappeared took about 8 seconds. The silence of such a large and obnoxious thing comparatively low in the sky and the way in which it moved is what made me stop to write this report. I have no way of explaining that at all. I am sure there are planes out there with weird shapes i have never seen, but silent ones that move straight up in the sky? any aircraft I know would have made a ton of noise that close to the ground, and they move across the sky. not up. I don't know of any craft with light formations like that, or that can move straight up into the sky like that. I have never seen the alien autopsy, don't watch any of those cable channels, never had much of an interest in UFOs really... but either our government has some pretty fancy top secret spy planes or I have no idea what I just saw.  For the next half hour, the same or another craft was flying around in the same general vicinity. At first, a single light high in the sky in exactly the spot where the craft had disappeared. Of course, it could have been the front end of the tail I had seen a few minutes earlier, now coming back down. Just that now it was a single light and I couldn't make out any craft. The first time I saw the light it went from faint to extremely bright then turned off entirely. Then, a few minutes later (maybe ten) I saw a light again, much higher in the sky, and it came on and off periodically and moved across the sky as if attached to a very high flying plane going 500mph at 30,000 feet. It moved differently than the first light. More like a very high flying plane - across the sky as one would expect. It was not a satellite - way too close for that. It was now moving just like a plane or something. If I had to guess, the first bright and disappeared light was the same unidentified cra! ft I saw earlier. It did not move like anything I know and was silent. The second moved like any other normal airplane - across the sky - save only that I could not hear anything in the sky when I should have been able to. If it was the same craft, then it went way up in the sky, way back down again, then up a little bit more and then across the sky.",2020-11-05T00:00:00,39.77638902439024,-121.82759634146342

I was sitting in the first-class cabin on the left side of the aircraft looking out of my window.  The object was a single unit that looked like three metallic red round orbs that were connected.  It flashed across my view and seemed to be moving at a downward angle. During my frequent air travel, I have seen multiple small aircraft passing below my view, and they have always been easily identified as small jets or airplanes.  This immediately caught my attention as an oddity.  I estimate the size to have been about the size of a VW Bug.  I can make the estimation of size purely on my perception of distance.

NOTE: I have also submitted this to MUFON as case 110160 and I am NICAP's MADAR Node # 44 in Pike County , Pa. I am a NJ MUFON Field Investigator at my summer home in Lords Valley, Pa. in a rural community in the Pocono Mountains surrounded by forest called Hemlock Farms. Yesterday was a beautiful cloudless night in the Poconos with a gazillion stars. I took my kids out to look for comet NEOWISE but we were disappointed but just for a bit!  Something spectacular happened. I love to stargaze and was on my porch in a pitch black forest watching the stars for 2 hours with my 8 y/o son David explaining the big dipper etc. At exactly 10:16 p.m. eastern time, we witnessed an object traverse the sky from southeast to northwest in no more than 8 seconds. It was an orange cylinder. No FAA standard lighting whatsoever. No comet or meteorite like trail behind it. At arms length it was the size of my pinky nail. It did not fly head to tail but rather sideways which I found bizarre as that is not aerodynamic. I used my closed fist to judge that it took 7 fists at 10 degrees of sky each to cross the heavens till I lost it behind my roof. 70 degrees of sky in 8 seconds give or take is FAST. I did not have my phone but it would have been gone by the time i readied the camera anyway. I ran to check the time (exactly 10:16 pm) and went to my computer to check flightradar24.com which uses UTC time which is tomorrow's date July 15 at 3:16 a.m. Attached is a screenshot of what I saw overlapping an otherwise silent flightradar24.com sky for the 15 minutes before and after the event. I am a very savvy MUFON Investigator and have never filed a MUFON report of my own but this thing was anomalous. Please see my attached screengrab with notations. Here is my dilemma. I also belong to NICAP's MADAR project which means I have a radar setup containing a very loud DAS alarm and a baramoter/magnetometer checking for magnetic or barometric changes.  My NICAP MADAR node IS #44. DAS alarm has never gone off in months. In my humble opinion this thing should have triggered my DAS alarm. It did not. My son became frightened and ran in the house when he saw it. I don't know how to calculate the speed of an object crossing 70 degrees of sky in 8 seconds but it was really fast!!!! Does anyone know the formula? Please teach me it if you know!  Additionally i get a lot of small Cessna type aircraft flying at between 2 and 4 thousand feet. Moments later such a craft passed by flying east to west. Judging by its size I estimate the orange sideways cigar was lower than 2000 feet and probably about 30 feet long but incredibly thin, perhaps only 2 feet wide from front to back.  No noise. Speed blew the Cessna out of the water. Cessna took about 40 seconds to cross the same amount of sky. I have been a photo analyst for MUFON for about 3 years. I have looked at hundreds of videos of orbs, triangles, cigars, etc. While it was a common shaped cigar, it was glowing orange which is something I never saw before and it wasn't flying nose to tail but rather width-wise (imagine airplane wings without a fusalage.)  This,for me rules out meteor however I have not had a chance to check the American Meteor Society fireball logs on their website yet. However it followed a straight path without variance and I feel it was a craft rather than an odd shaped orb. It was,however, the exact color typical of an orb, the kind which Pa. MUFON F.I. Terry Ray investigates!!  Recent advances in plasma technology can engulf an aircraft and appear as a plasma in the sky. This is done because plasma absorbs a radar beam and nothing is returned to the ground station which is why I think this object did not show on flightradar24.com even though it is visible to the naked eye. The other reason it may not have shown was because it was below radar level under 2000 feet by my reckoning. Finally in the flightradar24.com screen grab you can see the only air traffic of note was far to the east - two planes depicted as yellow objects. NOTE: Flightradar24.com uses UTC time. which is 5 hours later than eastern u.s. time. therefore the bottom of the flightradar24 screen grab shows July 15, 3:16 a.m. rather than local time of July 14, 10:16 pm. My feeling is that it was a UAV, but please feel free to disagree or call me with any additional questions you may have! I have been wrong before. I am also submitting to NUFORC as sometimes they get sightings similar to mine that MUFON doesn't get and vice versa!  Thank you!",2020-07-23T00:00:00,,

I’ve posted this incident beforehand but I didn’t put much of a description. This time I will explain it to the best of my abilities.  11:00PM CST  I was 16 when this happened. I had just started my 11th grade year earlier that month. It was a school night that night. I usually go to bed around 8:00 to wake up at 5:40AM. But this night was different in regards to the dream I had and how it affected me. I believe it was sometime around 11:00PM when the “dream” I had supposedly started. In this supposed dream I am standing in my living room behind my couch looking out of the open blinds in the Southwest corner looking up into the sky above the forest tree line across the street. As I’m looking out of the window I see 3 silver triangles with white pulsing lights on their edges. The where flying in a V formation. The point of the V was flying forward and the other 2 were flying directly behind it practically touching their edges together. As the “dream” continues I see the formation of pulsing triangles silently and slowly fly over the tree line. As I see them I get immediately freaked out and I say loudly, “Oh! my God I’m going to be abducted again!”. Then the dream blacks out and I’m suddenly fighting these random people. I’m in some random building. It looked like an lobby for a mechanic shop. I was holding a revolver and running up to a man that was in the lobby area. As I run up I slide down to one knee, and aim straight at this random mans forehead. The mans face looked like he had a beard. He was also wearing a black leather duster of some sort. He was wearing a beige shirt underneath the duster. He was wearing jeans, and also boots. As I’m sliding up to him and aiming at his forehead he is also aiming back at me. I shoot at him. He falls down dead. Behind the man there were two black plastic chairs with a glass table in between. On the table there were bullets. I stay on one knee and reload the revolver. I run out the door of the lobby to the outside. Outside there was a dirt road. Across the street from the supposed mechanics shop is a red wooden building. It looked like ! a vehicle shed for farm equipment. On the wall of vehicle shed! there i s a door. From that same door comes out a guy that looks somewhat similar to the first guy I shot. I shoot him in the knee as he’s rushing out. He falls forward. Behind me from the same direction where the mechanics shop is an older woman, maybe 50 is running up to me. She had longer hair in a braided ponytail that was grey. Ah was wearing a red plaid button up, jeans and boots. She was holding what looked like a broom handle with 3 little blades sticking out the front. As she’s coming up behind me I turn around and disarm her and I get ready to stab her with this bladed broom handle. As I’m just about to stab her I hear the guy behind me that I just shot yell out, “Mama, Nooo!!”. As he says this I turn my head and look at him then turn back to the woman and I just start to sob. I lean forward and sob on the woman’s shoulder. After the sobbing started it’s like everything just froze. The woman was froze in place and was rigged. Her mouth stayed open from the moment I disarme! d her till the dream blacked out again. After the dream blacks out I wake up in bed and instantly lean forward and sit up. I look at the clock and it’s now 4:30AM CST. I then  lay back down and close my eyes till my alarm.  The part when I fighting those random people always makes me question. “Did they abduct me and take me to some farm and I attacked it? Or was it a simulation on their ship?”. I believe it was a combat simulation that I was put into. During the dream the fighting in the dream there was a weird white light coming from the sky. There were no stars. Just pitch black nothingness. This abduction makes me think that they were testing my combat capabilities. Believe that I am possibly in a bloodline that might have to fight something later on.   Months after this abduction (and still to this day) I have something that I can only describe as a “Combat sense”. When I was just trying to think my mind would constantly make scenarios. If someone was to attack me at any moment my mind was giving me the fighting moves I needed to do. Even when I was typing this report I felt it kick in. They want me to fight. And I believe that other possible bloodlines will join in this fight. If I have a dream with a UFO  in it I believe I was abducted. Sometimes there is no dream and I just wake up with a random scab.",2020-09-04T00:00:00,37.98475253093363,-87.51397041619798

We were headed to Pittsburgh to visit the in-laws for Thanksgiving.  As we were headed east, having just passed the Lordstown Assembly plant, I looked out the driver side window and spotted a couple of lights to the NE. I kept glancing over and noticed that they were not blinking.  As I was driving, I asked my 12-year old, who was seated behind me to look out her window and verify she could see the lights, as well.  She confirmed she could see them also.  The lights were heading S by SW, and we could now see 3 white lights.  I was still waiting for some blinking to confirm a commercial aircraft, but all we saw were the 3 white steady lights. The sky was very dark, with heavy cloud cover.  Additionally, the moon was at about .4% as a waning crescent so this added to the lack of illumination in the sky.  We continued to watch the object as it flew towards us at a relatively slow rate of speed. It did not match the speed of the planes we saw landing at Detroit Metro, or Cleveland on our way out of town, or in Pittsburgh afterwards.  As I watched the approach, I could make out a dark triangular shape, but was challenged in documenting much further as I was driving, and my wife was getting irritated with the amount of attention the object was getting from me. I asked my daughter to try and take a picture with her phone, but it was fruitless with an iPhone, through a window on a dark night.  When we got to my in-law's I hopped online to see which bases were in proximity. The one that popped for me was Wright-Patterson, just outside of Dayton, lying to the SW of our location and in the direction the object was heading. I am inclined to believe it was military and that the lunar phase and additional cloud cover made for an opportune evening for a clandestine flight. However, it was unidentified, and with the amount of black triangle sightings reported over the years, I thought I should share.",2020-09-04T00:00:00,,

First, the story: I was hesitant to write this experience but I feel like it is something I should share.  I was driving north on I-95 in Georgia, USA between Brunswick and Savannah in Georgia after visiting my sister in Florida .  The date was 1/11/2020 and around 1:30 AM is when it happened.  As I was driving all off the sudden, very high up in the atmosphere a red light appeared, directly to the right (east) of the highway.  It stayed there for a second or 2 before descending, very rapidly, over the course of 4-5 seconds to just above the tree line. It struck me as odd because the lights didn't blink, they were very bright from a distance, and the distance that it descended in that time was staggering.  I thought it was a plane descending the opposite direction I was traveling but the non blinking lights and fast descent threw me off.  It stopped at the end of the descent, right above the tree line, where it remained stationary.  Numerous times when I have been driving I have noticed that when pla! nes travel in the opposite direction to you, when they are low they give the appearance they are stationary so I chalked it up to that, but something still seemed off.  It took about 10 seconds before I got to the craft (I was traveling ~80 mph) and realized it was something I've never seen before. When I passed it, it was hovering about 50 ft SE and 50 ft vertical (best guess) over the tower east of I-95 and a side road (the side road was directly east of I-95, south of belfast keller road). This tower is right off the highway, maybe 100 feet. It was so close and low, and so crystal clear that I couldn't really process what I had seen at the time. It was ever so slightly rotating (barely discernable) clockwise in the x and y direction (z being vertical or normal to the earth) when I passed it. After I passed it I looked in the rear view mirror and couldn't see anything but I think the tree line hid it from that angle. I didn't have a good night camera at the time either (my! cell phone camera was cracked, and on top of that takes horri! ble nigh t pictures), which I wish I had. It was also a long drive (~7 hours) so I kept on driving to get home. The only thing I could think of was that this was military in nature and that the craft liked radio towers.  Description of craft: I would describe the craft as follows but I have also made a 3D CAD model of it as well in autodesk inventor. It was shaped like an equilateral triangle, with each side having the length of a semi truck with trailer or slightly bigger. The edges of that triangle were chamfered and it appeared to have no thickness due to the angle I saw it at. There were 6 lights, symmetric about the center and having the same exact color as a car brakelight. There was another triangular shaped, vertically recessed area in the center that was chamfered to the lower section.. In that center, there was a dome (Imagine a sphere that has been chopped at 1/3 to 1/4 of it's diameter) that appeared to be made of a thick glass but whatever was underneath was the blackest black I have ever seen. It stood out. I was driving so I couldn't say it made no noise but it didn't make any discernable noise.",2020-09-04T00:00:00,,

My wife and I were enjoying the view from the hot tub on our back deck.  It was a clear evening and blue skies with no clouds or wind.  Looking SE, I noticed a large shimmering white oval shape silently hovering in a vertical position approximately 400 yards from us at an altitude of around 300 feet.  Its size was about 50 feet tall and 30 feet wide.  I asked my wife to look and see if she saw what I was looking at she said yes. At first we thought it might be a balloon, but it was too big and the wrong shape.  As we observed this stationary object, it began to slowly rotate.  The rotating object appeared to have panels that changed to a darker shade.  I then jumped out of the tub and grabbed a pair of binoculars that were close by and focused on the unit.  Just then the object quickly dropped about 50 feet, and then shot back up to its original height.  This made me put the binoculars down. Just as I did this, I saw 3 or 4 small white lights flash approximately 50 y! ards to the left of the object and it just vanished.  No wind or any sounds were heard during this event.  3 minutes after the UFO left, a low flying military jet flew right over us which seemed odd and out of place with the usual aircraft we see.",2020-08-27T00:00:00,47.7542,-122.2444

At approximately 22:00, we noticed what appeared to be an aircraft with a red navigation light traveling in a SW direction at approximately 5,000ft altitude.  No noise was heard. Shortly after, 2 white/gold (white Christmas light color), orb-like objects appeared to be flying alongside the ""aircraft""/red light.  The orb lights then appeared to chase each other in a circular motion around the red light/""aircraft"" and also ""danced"" back and forth between the front and rear of the red light.  At times, the white lights would turn off and appear in a different location. We continued to observe the group of lights traveling in a SW direction as they traveled farther away and higher in altitude.  The white orbs were still ""dancing"" around the red object and chasing each other in completely random zig zag and swirl patterns as far as we could see.  Another odd observance was that the lights continued to travel on the same trajectory and never came back down towards the horizon.  The lights continued to be visible at a great distance until they finally disappeared approximately 1 hour after first sighting. There were 3 witnesses to this event and none of us had ever seen anything like this before. Photos and videos were taken, however the lights aren't really visible. I also recorded our GPS coordinates, heading indicator, date and timestamps.

Time is approximate, give or take 30 minutes...Sorry. I'm a night owl, so I went out to stand in my garage/driveway to observe the street.  I'm a retired state law enforcement lieutenant - so I try to be cognizant of my neighborhood and surroundings, especially since there have been thefts in the neighborhood in the past. I also like to watch the sky (we're on one of the approaching routes to Myrtle Beach Int'l Airport - and, occasionally military planes fly overhead or do touch-and-goes at the airport between the commercial flights).  At this hour, I don't expect anything from MB Int Airport, but the stars were out, and I enjoy the panoramic view of the sky this flat land affords me compared to the mountainous/hilly northeast I'm from. I've stared at the stars before, and while star-gazing, I've noticed some slow-moving trajectories across the sky.  I realize these are satellites in orbit. I've also twice witnessed the ISS cross the sky above my house (it was reported that it would be flying overhead beforehand by a local weatherman, so my wife and I would go outside to watch it).  The slow-deliberate pace of these satellites as they look like stars, but move across the night sky faster, as the the real stars seem to stay in place always enthralled me. Incident:  On the above (approximate) date and time, I was again looking into the sky at the stars when I noticed a flashing white light pulsing about every second or so.  It was already just south of my home when I first noticed it.  It was moving in a north/northeast to a south/southwest direction.  I thought it was peculiar because it seemed so high up, like a satellite would appear/similar to a star in the sky.  This one was different since the light flashed every second or so, actually flashing like a sparkle in the sky. At first, I thought it was just an airliner (even though I've seen airliners and their lights, and can still make out the red and green lights airliners have even at their cruising high-altitudes).  This light seemed higher, the white flashing light seemed very strong, and it was only the one brightly flashing white light, with nothing else. I was thinking that was odd (because the light was flashing so brightly with no other lights) and then I noticed another flashing light coming behind the first. The second flashing light was travelling in the exact same path as the first, only quite a distance behind.  I watched the two of them travel in a perfect straight-line/flight path directly behind one another, keeping the somewhat-large distance between them as they continued south-southwest. As I scanned the sky to look for more, I noticed two more bright, flashing lights coming from the north/northeast.  They, too, were acting in the same manner as the first two, and following exactly the same straight line across the sky, all while keeping the same distance between themselves and the first two lights/ships.  At one point, all four were still in my view, perfectly spaced apart, as they headed downrange to the south/southwest.  I did take notice of how how straight their flight-path was, and how perfectly distanced each one was behind the other. Unfortunately, I did not have my phone/camera with me when I stepped outside and witnessed this.",2020-08-27T00:00:00,33.89340405405405,-78.96144391891892

The information that you a receiving right now, has been confirmed by a field investigator from MUFON. I, Eric Ossmann submitted my evidence into MUFON, and after a year of investigations confirming the images and video is in fact a UAV. I have a full report on these findings. However, I would like to have this look at from a different perspective, and see if this can be enhanced through any available rendering and filtering software that you may have at your deposal? It is known that between the years of 2018 and 2019 a lot of footage, and videos have been released regarding UFO, and UAV sightings all a crossed the United States. MUFON investigation concluded that this was a UAV, and checked with the FAA, along with putting the footage and pictures through some of their rendering and filtering software. However, over the course of time when this was initially reported, technology has become more enhanced. There are no reports from the FAA regarding this UAV or anything that was reported from any aircraft around the area at that time. Keep in mind, this sighting is in proximity to Mill Stone Nuclear power plant, Groton New London Airport, and also military bases such a National Guard AVCRAD, and Groton Naval Subbase. It is known that UFO’s are attracted to these kinds of attractions. As an estimate, this UAV altitude is around 60K to 70K up. Please look at the pictures first before reviewing the video to show the exact placement of the UAV. Then review the video at the 7 second mark. The black dot you see hovering, will then move at split second, leaving no contrails.I have included a screen shot of the exact placement of this UAV, please see the red boxed area to give you a better understanding the location of this UAV.

I stopped my truck just inside the driveway and watched out my open driver’s side window thinking I was about to witness a huge explosion. I was facing north and the thing(s) I witnessed were moving toward me and to the left, so southwest. It was already dark and all I could really see at first were lights. As I watched I realized there were two things happening: one looked to be a single engine plane turning down and left (so, eastward) and crashing in slow motion toward the intersection; the other thing looked to be the lights of a helicopter staying the original SW trajectory. The first object, as it was facing me during its turn, was visible only as (what looked like) the two FAA wingtip lights, except both were red. I could just barely make out a structure between the lights. It completed its turn and slowed in the air to almost a stop, pointing down at an angle toward the intersection. At this point I could make out a third red light behind the two, which showed me the angle. It wasn’t a completely side-on view, maybe ten degrees toward me. Suddenly the area between the two front lights looked like a bank of ten large flat screens, side by side, and they were alternating the purplish glow similar to a blacklight from the center out to the red lights at the tip, then back to center. I could count five pulses from center to tips, so I assume ten “screens”. It did this four or five times that I could count as it floated. The craft was barely moving forward at this point. It was pointing straight at the westbound traffic parked at the intersection and flashing this pattern in that type of blacklight that isn’t really visible straight on. I feel like I could only see the purplish glow because of the angle I was looking at it from. The second set of lights that looked like helicopter lights kept on coasting, and after that brief few seconds of purplish pulsing the first set of lights began to turn back toward me and rise. Then a car pulled into the drive behind me, almost hitting me, so I had to pull forward into the complex and park. I did this quickly and grabbed my binoculars (I use a crappy old tracfone, so I didn’t bother trying to get a picture with it). I stepped back toward Hayden Rd. and I could see the lights were already flying together again and had resumed the SW trajectory. I looked through my binoculars and I could see that the one set of lights was indeed a helicopter because there is so much ambient light from the ground below. The red lights that floated over the intersection were on what honestly looked like a huge flat triangular box, one on each corner. And it was moving flat side forward, counterintuitively for a flying triangular shape. After a few more seconds they were lost to the distance behind a big stand of palms. I got the impression that all three sides of this craft were the same kind of screens. And as it was floating over the intersection I was reminded of how a cuttlefish hunts, using pulsing color patterns to hypnotize prey. I asked the local community in many forums and face to face if anyone saw this and found nothing. I searched numerous times over the following months for some kind of advertisement craft that matched this and found nothing. It’s unidentified, but whatever it was it’s official SOMEWHERE because of that helicopter escort.",2021-12-19T00:00:00,33.56413757440476,-111.9050830357143

Moments before the splashdown occurred (which was at exactly 2:48pm Eastern) I saw an object outside in the sky, through the southernmost of my three 2nd floor row home windows, which are facing East, and provide a very good view of the sky over Eastern Baltimore. Note: I see a tremendous amount of air traffic through these windows on a daily basis, including police and MEDEVAC helicopters, BWI air traffic (mostly making landing approaches), various private and commercial aircraft, and occasional military overflights (cargo, A-10s, etc.) I have had a lifelong interest in aircraft, have flown a Robinson R-22 helicopter, and can generally identify every aircraft I see. I first noticed this object, I would estimate, about 45-60 seconds before the splashdown at 2:48pm -- the four parachutes on the capsule were deployed, they had switched from the airborne to the the surface/ship-based camera view of the capsule coming down, and I was really trying to pay attention to what was going on on my TV, as I had been watching the stream for a good 45+ minutes, waiting for the safe return. But something about this object out of the corner of my eye, going by in the sky outside, absolutely demanded my attention -- something about it struck me as ""off"" and worthy of more attention, even though I was distracted by the Space X capsule return going on on my TV. The television was literally saying things like ""the spacecraft is about to return,"" and similar statements. I got up and walked several feet to my window, and looked out at the object. I was completely blown away by what I saw -- it was a highly-reflective/super-shiny ellipsoid, with a clearly-defined surface that looked shiny like a finely-polished steel. I interpreted it as seeing a traditional disc-shaped UFO, seen from the side, but from my point of view it was a longer oval, or ellipsoid. Toward the upper-right corner of this aircraft-sized object, there was an ongoing, irregular flashing or glinting of yellowish light. At first I thought it might be a reflection of the Sun, but for the whole (estimated) 60-90 seconds I saw this thing flying North/Northeast (I would say generally toward Towson/Parkville), there was this irregular glinting, visually evident even when the object was a speck out in the distance in the Northeastern sky near the horizon. As I said, it was clearly the size of an aircraft -- not a balloon. It traveled at a consistent speed and in a consistent direction, perhaps roughly the speed a helicopter would fly at. It did not bob around or make any sudden movements, or apparent changes to altitude or heading. I did not think to photograph the object, because frankly I was utterly stunned by what I was seeing, and the odd synchronicity of seeing a UFO (my only sighting in my ~44 years) at the exact moment of a spacecraft returning to Earth on TV, with the TV issuing a fairly relevant narration for what I was seeing out of my living room window. It was very, very odd. I have had a lifelong interest in UAP, and this is the only thing I have seen that I would remotely describe as a UFO -- and it was not a speck, not a dot, not a light, not something vague -- it was a super-shiny silver disc thing flying by in the middle of the afternoon, totally casually. My estimation is that it was flying relatively low, definitely under a few thousand feet. My sense is it was traveling between my location in Baltimore's Abell neighborhood, and Lake Montebello. I think it was probably near Loch Raven Blvd. I would estimate it was maybe 30-50 feet in diameter? The size of an aircraft, but I think closer to a smaller plane or a helicopter, versus an airliner. No obvious features, just a very shiny/reflective metallic surface, making that weird glinting flash. About a week later I had the idea to see if aircraft flight data is available online, and learned that ADS-B was at that point fully in service (I'd heard about it years earlier, but didn't know it had been fully rolled out). Because I knew the precise several-minute window of my sighting, due to its overlap with the Space X splashdown, I was able to ""rewind"" to the airspace at the time using Flightradar 24. I saw absolutely nothing, at all, flying over the entire Baltimore 495 area, for a few minutes on either side of the 2:48pm Eastern splashdown. I checked the time many times, to make sure I wasn't making an error in an Eastern to UTC conversion (Flightradar24 historical data is recorded in UTC). Nothing, within the entire circumference of the 495 beltway.

As I was driving back I noticed some very odd looking lights in the sky. I stopped my car to get a good look at them and about 5 of them disappeared immediately as soon as I took notice. However 3 were still visible and did not move. There was only 1 of them close to me in the foreground and it had a white/orange glow and waves of light were flowing off of the ship. I looked further up to the one on the top right and could clearly see that it was a disk shaped ""saucer"". I also took notice that it was ""wobbling"" on it's axis which immediately grabbed my attention. I gazed for a while before finally deciding to hit the record button on my phone as they were leaving.

I had previously dismissed them as Chinese Lanterns or drones or something, but recent posts regarding ejecta from UAPs has gotten me thinking about 1 particular aspect of this video. Some things to point out/mention: The particular aspect I am referring to is the quick moving (right to left) 3rd light at the start of the video. It's interesting to me in that it start out small and then begins to glow brighter as it travels. Also, if all of these lights are Chinese lanterns, it seems there would need to be a mighty gust of wind over there to shoot one light to the left while the other 2 continue to move to the right at a consistent clip. It appears to me that perhaps the 3rd light could have been ejected from the middle light somehow. Speaking of ""third lights"", right before I shot this, a fourth light, same size as the first two, split off from the group and also went left (but if had ejected from one of the other lights, I didn't see it). So the little light that shoots left in the video almost seems like it was going toff to wherever that other light went, in a hurry. I watched them long enough to deduce they were definitely not planes. I build and fly FPV racing drones and photography drones like the Mavic Pro with hundreds of hours of flight time so I'm fairly accustomed to observing flying objects both line of sight and FPV and I have a solid grasp on how all manner of drones move in the air...and these don't seem to be that to me, either. In going down the rabbit hole on this subject, there seems to be a common thread of ""an orange color"" in a lot of mysterious orb sightings, and these are decidedly orange, no? FWIW, around 17 seconds you can hear a kid exclaim that he sees them, too. Just mentioning that to confirm there were others there that saw, and FWIW, it did not seem ""normal"" at the time.",2021-12-19T00:00:00,40.65308611066301,-73.9558831747056

It was a very clear night so I assumed it was a planet or something I missed hearing about being able to see since I’m not so big on social media anymore these days and I don’t watch the news. About 30-45 minutes later, I was heading home on route 102 in Chester from Derry. I was on the phone with my friend who lives less than a mile from me in Chester and who was home and getting ready to meet me at my house. As I approached the center of Chester at the 102 and 121 intersection I saw an insanely bright light coming from the 121A area toward Sandown. I took the right onto 121A while telling my front what I was seeing, he said that he had “something weird in the sky” himself a little while ago. He got in his car and headed to mat house at the same time as me as we stayed on the phone. I took a left onto a side street off of 121A in Chester, the closer I got, the brighter the light got, it was so low, and moved so slowly, like a crawl. The light was this different kind of bright. Much stronger and wider than a flood light. Like a globe of bright of off-white hue. As I took the left it was to my right coming toward me  it looked as if almost barely missing the roofs. As it passed so. Fucking. slowly. Above me, I saw that it looked like a stealth bomber or something similar, and the whole entire underside of the left wing was light up red, the middle was that massive bright I was se! eing but it seemed to be dimming now, and the right wing under side was lit up in blue. It crawled over 121A toward Hampstead out of sight for just a short second, and then it reappeared- it had taken a right and was a little further in the distance. I got out of my car when I could still see it and it was silent but in its path behind it left a trail that felt and sounded almost like a wind tunnel or a subway arriving while waiting inside and underground station. It stopped what looked like over the Chester General Store area for a good a 45 minutes, it just hovered in the air.  	My friend arrived while I was still in the driveway and saw it turn and where it was hovering. We were on my back porch smoking while we watched it hover through the trees in the distance and seem to play tricks on us With the lights. Flashing greens and reds. All of a sudden we see it start moving toward us, again, so. fucking. slowly. Through trees, it goes right over my neighbors house, takes a right, we go inside and watch it through the windows, through the trees. Down the middle of the street, crawling through the air, and we go out the front door. It takes another right, so now it is where it was the first time I saw it about an hour ago. It turned slightly so it was now angled a little more toward us, then it stopped and hovered for a minute or so. Suddenly odd flashing lights catch the corner of our eyes to our right, we see what looks to be another one but seems to be smaller or look as if it were fourth in the distance. It come closer, stops and hovers. The other! one turns toward it. They both go directly at each other, a little faster than they had been, but still slowly, while red and white lights were flashing like lasers almost from each other, then they meet nose to nose and go directly over/under each other behind a thick cloud. We lose site of one for a few minuted while the other one stops almost immediately from the cloud. Then we suddenly started seeing orange and green blinking lights from much further away all and seemed to be in some kind of formation.  We saw the same things in the sky just at a further distance the next day. We both felt like it was “watching us” through the trees when we could see the light. It had a creepy feeling. I was so grateful my friend was there to witness it with me or I literally would have thought that I had lost my mind or had been dreaming, it all seemed so unreal, like a movie.",2020-05-01T00:00:00,42.9707,-71.2395

From the bedroom window at the rear of the apartment, diagonally across from the building hovering over the trees appeared a triangular-shaped object with lights around it that seemed to shimmer.  As it remained motionless, we wrote it off as likely being some sort of tower lights, a warning apparatus for airplanes in the vicinity.  The only thing is that we had no memory of such an apparatus in that location which seemed not that far off from us. I came back several times to observe it and the object was still in the exact same spot, so I assumed that it really was some stationery warning light.  At around 11:30 PM just before going to bed, I looked out the bedroom window and to my surprise the object was no longer in sight. It is now exactly 9:05 PM on Friday, March 6th, 2020.  About an hour ago, I looked out of the bedroom window and to my astonishment, the very same triangular object surrounded by shimmering lights was back in the sky behind the building, this time almost directly in front of the bedroom window at a point in the sky where a low-flying plane might fly.  However, the object hovered and remained hovering in that position.  About ten minutes ago, I went back to the bedroom window and observed that the triangular object has now moved about thirty degrees to the right at about the same level in the sky where I noticed it an hour or so ago. This is certainly no light in a tower and it is certainly not an airplane. No airplane can hover in the sky for an hour and then move to another position in the sky and hover there for how much longer, I don’t know.  I have to conclude that we have spotted a UFO.

EST. I observed a commercial aircraft at altitude, traveling in a westernly or northwesterly direction.  I was initially attracted to this as the commercial aircraft was trailing a beautiful con trail.  I took my eyes off the aircraft several times as I was driving, but I continued to glance up at it intermittantly, and suddenly I observed another object following behing the first aircraft at what I would estimate at under 1 mile, although I cannot be certain of exact distance.  First observed second object as it began to glow brightly as if the sunlight were glaring off of it.  Second object appeared behind and just outside of con trail at what appeared to be same altitude and speed, and traveling in same direction.  Found it somewhat puzzeling that there was no sun glare off of first aircraft, and also that there was no con trail from the second object even though it appeared to be at same a!ltitude and airspeed as the commercial aircraft.  Also, this second aircraft seemed to be following much closer than any I've ever witnessed within the local flight corridors.  With the recent events concerning military aircraft closing on commercial aircraft from behind and triggering the commercial aircrafts anti-collision warning system, and it struck me as being rather odd that these two were reletively near one another in flight to not have such systems activate.  I observed the second object for about 10 or 12 seconds as it appeared to reflect the sunlight, it then stopped reflecting light and the glare stopped, and I continued to see an obhject but could not determine shape.  Within a few seconds of the glare from the sunlight reflecting off the second object had ceased, I lost sight of the 2nd object.  I continued to observe the first aircraft and it's con trail as it flew off into the distance.  The best I can estimate, the first aircraft was approximately over or nea!r Gettysburg at the time I made this observation.  I'm sorry to say that I did not observe any unusual flight characteristics such as phenomenal or unusual speed or course deviations.  When I stated a commercial aircraft I was inferring larger sized, it may have been a large military aircraft I suppose.

Object description: saucer-like.  Two main sections, one lower section, and an upper section roughly half the diameter of the lower section.  Color was silvery-grey.  Object emitted an ear piercing buzzing noise at all times until it departed.  While no lights were visible on the object, night sky was lit up as if an overcast day. Narrative:  I was six years old at the time and in the first grade.  It was shortly after the new year, and my grandparents were visiting from out of town (my grandfather was a recently retired career investigator for the Federal Government who still had to make regular court appearances on behalf of the United States and as such was unable to host Christmas festivities that year, so they came for New Years). I had been awakened by the loud buzzing noise and was in my bed, which was in a bedroom that I shared with my younger sibling.  There was a window directly above his bed.  As I awoke I was lying on my side, facing his window and observed the object hovering above the block that my home was on at an altitude of about 100ft (if my memory serves, which admittedly it may not).  I was immediately panic stricken and ran to my parents’ bedroom, hoping to awaken my father, who as an avid hunter, had several firearms which I believed would be effective for protection against UFO-associated entities (which to my six year old mind meant “space aliens”).  While I did not scream (fearful that screaming would alert the entities to my location and thus put me in danger), I did violently try to shake my parents awake.  They would not awaken. Realizing that I would be unable to rouse my parents, I came to the conclusion that the only safe space to hide was underneath their blankets.  I did not cover my eyes, as I wanted early warning if entities were to enter the room so I could hide further or make some attempt at resisting.  I remained there for several minutes, motionless, terrified that they would discover me if I moved or made a sound. After several minutes had passed, I heard a loud “whooshing” noise (the closest thing that the whoosh sounded like was the sound of the SOLG firing in the 2005 video game “Ace Combat 5” from the penultimate mission).  After the whooshing noise, the sky darkened and the ear piercing buzzing stopped. I remained motionless for slightly longer, fearful that the object would return and that this was all a ploy to get me to drop my defenses.  After some additional time had passed, I was convinced they were gone for good and passed out. The next morning I told my story to my family members.  At that time and to this day, they have no recollection of the events of that night, but do remember hearing me tell this story to them in my childhood.  My parents dismissed it as a dream, but this series of events had no similarities with the dreams I often had at that time (for starters, my nightmares always took place outdoors or at school, never inside my home, and I would bolt awake upon seeing any monsters or robots – and never did I see anything that looked like a UFO-associated entity in my nightmares). Only one of my peers in school had any UFO-related incidents to my knowledge, but he tragically passed away several years ago.  I have had no further UFO incidents or any dreams/memories that could be interpreted as being abduction related.  However, a handful of relatives (also sadly now deceased) have reported close encounters of their own when hearing my tale. I suspect that this might have been an abduction-event, but one in which some other person was targeted and that for whatever reason, I was unable to be paralyzed.",2020-07-31T00:00:00,43.066514168714164,-89.38736175266175

To make a long story short, after I arrived back home, I ended up spending the next 6 hour’s watching what started as a unusually warm, beautiful day with a cloudless clear sky, transformed by a massive amount of airplane fly-bys that were emitting what at first looked like contrails. However the contrails never disappeared. They just billowed out until they eventually looked like wispy thin cloud coverings in various shapes. By the end of this 6-hour period, these things were everywhere I could see. Two or 3 hours into watching the chemtrails develop and the continuous planes crossing the sky, a flash caught my eye and focused my attention on a:  1. Solid object 2. Fat and short cylinder-like (kind of barrel shaped perhaps)--no protrusions or propellers or anything else that I could see. 2. Whitish  3. Hovered in place for ~ 2 minutes (I could tell it wasn't moving because it's distance didn't change from the chemtrail it was somewhat near). 4. After ~ 2 minutes, it started moving and went behind one of the chemtrails..at which point I could no longer see it. 5.  No lights  6.  No sound 7.  No contrail  Though I have no way to tell how large it was since it was fairly high in the sky, I got the sense that if I was standing next to it, it would have been the size of a car.  Nothing to base that on except my impression though.  Quite unremarkable other than it hovered in place for ~2 minutes and then moved at will. Even though there were countless planes going through the general vicinity during that 6 hour time period, this was not a plane or helicopter by any stretch of the imagination.  Because I had camera in hand already (I took over 30 pictures of the chemtrails during my 6-hour skywatching), I attempted to take pictures of the object.  It turned out really small and when I blew it up enough to be able to see it on the picture, it pixilates beyond recognition.",2020-07-31T00:00:00,46.17882291666667,-119.16297812500001

Downtown Dallas is clearly visible.  I saw clear as day, a saucer like, grey metallic but not reflective object perhaps 45 degrees above my 4th floor elevation in the horizon and directly in front of me.  It took me several seconds to mentally register what I'm seeing because it was surreal.  The object was perfectly still and I'm guessing it was midway between my location and downtown and as a guess, perhaps 100 feet in diameter. I stared at it for a few seconds in disbelief and quickly turned around to find someone else in my area to point it out to.  I could not find anyone at all.  I went back to the window and it was still there for a few more seconds. Suddenly, it moved west (at seemingly the same the elevation) at such astonishing speed I could not believe what I was watching.  It stopped cold where I can still see it at a distance, perhaps several miles away.  It moved there in less than one second.  Note, I watched it travel that long distance (it wasn't that it reappeared there)..  Again, it stayed afloat for a few seconds. Then, it returned to the exact same place where I first saw it - directly above and in front of me.  It stayed there for perhaps 2-3 seconds and then it moved again at lightening speed due south (over downtown Dallas) at seemingly the same elevation and disappeared from sight. I was shaken by what I saw and frustrated nobody was near me to point it out and confirm what I was seeing. This happened a long time ago and will never forget it and have told no one because of fear of being ridiculed.

The time was about 8pm. Sun was on the western horizon with dimming light through the trees, so there was no direct sunlight/glare as we were in the shadow of the house. We were facing south. I noticed a small red light appear over the trees in the distance that appeared to be approaching. Soon, the object was nearing and appeared as a red beach ball illuminated from the inside....translucent red orb with a bright dot of red light in the center. Size of craft appeared to be 20 to 25 feet in diameter. Speed estimated to be 100 to 120 mph based on experience with, and habit of observing small civilian aircraft, as compared to a Cessna 150 or 152. Altitude estimated at 1500 to 2000 feet, but seemed to be lower. Craft moved in a deliberate, controlled manner, not drifting as would a balloon. Craft traveled north and disappeared beyond nearby trees w! here sighting was lost. Craft produced no noise.  Three other witnesses present did observe this same object, but gave no two corroborating statements as to the nature of the object. Witness #1 stated it was an aircraft. (Where was engine/prop noise common to type?) Witness #2 stated it was a balloon, despite traveling in a straight line, no wavering in path, and no wind to account for velocity.) Witness #3 stated it was clearly a helicopter. (Again, where is engine and rotor noise?)  Myself and my wife were the only observers present who agreed on size, shape, color/appearance, approximate speed and altitude, and lack of obvious terrestrial  aircraft related appearance or sound signature.  Next day, encounter was related to a coworker who stated that such sightings were common and more frequent the closer one was to Whiteman AFB.  If I may... While doing my own UFO research, I have recently learned of a 1974 incident in Coyame, Mexico in which an unidentified object appeared on USAF radar moving at high speed towards US airspace. Object ""sensed"" it was being tracked and reversed course, colliding with a small, single engined civilian aircraft. Both craft crashed. The civilian plane was all but completely destroyed. The UFO was damaged but remained intact. Mexican authorities were in the process of transporting the damaged UFO when the convoy was allegedly intercepted by US CIA assets. Mexican authorities at the scene did not attempt to resist. The craft was subsequently taken to Whiteman AFB, Missouri.  I have heard your reports of similar Red Sphere craft in the past 2 weeks on an overnight radio show. I believe these sightings are connected and they are searching for the object taken to Whiteman. The craft was obviously small enough to be transported via truck and fit into a bomber-sized aircraft hangar. However, on the east side of the base are the underground bunkers for munitions storage. I believe one or more of these bunkers my be more than just a bunker, as other reports indicate frequent UFO sightings and encounters in the airspace over Whiteman AFB, with at least one reported incidence of a UFO directly probing multiple bunkers with a beam of light.  I do not normally approach problems like other people and tend to see deeper into things and make connections where others do not. Hope this helps.",2020-07-31T00:00:00,38.6503,-92.3967

I had just gotten back from Europe the night before and spent the day packing up.  That night as we were drinking we noticed a very bright star that was just over the tree line to our south.  The light was directly above the tallest tree.  It was as bright if not brighter than north star. Throughout the night we noticed that this star did not follow the sky east to west.  In fact many times we noticed it got higher in the sky, then the next time we looked it had moved to the east.  The next time it was to the west and below the tip of the tallest tree.  Consistantly it was in different locations to the point we made an active decision to look every 30 minutes.  Around 3am everyone except myself went to bed. I sat around the fire watching the light in my thoughts. Around 4:30am the light started moving much faster and I was able to see it move back and forth across the sky.  After 5 minutes of shuffling back and forth it started to blink like a strobe getting brighter and brighter then it dissapeared. For the next 20 minutes or so o was scanning the sky trying to figure out what happened when right where I was looking the bright light flashed once again and reappeared. After this it lowered in the sky and then I could tell it was coming towards my direction. Within 5 minutes of it lowering I saw it fly directly over my head to the point I could see detail. This was about 5am just as the sky was starting to lighten up. It was a square maybe 75ft long 3pft wide, with the front ""windshield"" being in the angle of a trapezoid. There was no windshield, everything was completely reflective metal. I could see giant rivets or bolts holding each section of metal together. The wings were similar to origami bird wings shape yet they were at maybe 35° angle. I did see a bluish light coming out of the back not flame but similar in shape like jet propulsion and color. However it made absolutely zero noise which was crazy being how low it was. Maybe 200ft in the air. After it flew over me it continued north across the lake. After it flew a ways away and was small in the sky again it began to flash once again and I saw it look as if it stretched out and it was gone . I noticed as soon as it flew off all the bugs started to make noise like it was an eclipse. Every bug was making noise. None of my friends would get out of the tent to watch as they were sleeping and hungover. I took video of it on my phone. The next day after charging it I went to show my friends the video and my phone had been factory reset and I lost everything. It has been 8 years and I can remember it as it was last night.",2020-07-31T00:00:00,,

It was around 0230 in the morning.  I know this, because I pulled over and drew two pictures on my phone that are time-stamped immediately following my experience. I was heading northbound about to make a right turn that would have me parallel to railroad tracks approximately two blocks from the beach on the Gulf Coast.  About 20-30 yards before making my right turn, I suddenly noticed a very bright light above my car.  I remember thinking to myself, ""Where is this light coming from?""  It appeared very suddenly and was extremely bright, almost blinding.  This blinding light caught my immediate attention, because I drove past this area almost every other night to see my best friend and this light was never there before.  Just as soon as I noticed the light, it was gone.  I take a right at a stop sign (now going northeast) and am now parallel with the aforementioned railroad tracks.  I went approximately 1.6 miles when I suddenly noticed what appeared to be a metallic saucer-like flying object in the sky appear before my eyes.  It was about 50 yards northwest of me, on the other side of the tracks, hovering above a big brown house.  I know exactly which house it was to this day which is why I can tell you exactly how far I drove.  There was light emitting from the bottom of the UFO going down in a V shape, like a tornado, over the house with the same hue of ""true"" white light that was above my car not long before.  I will now describe the UFO to you.  It was disk-shaped but fairly thick/tall/great in height.  Part of me wants to tell you to think of an oval as opposed to being flatter, like a disk.  There were lights going horizontally across the sides that repeated this pattern:  )•(  )•(  )•(  )•(  with the lights being only the center dots (white light) and the parentheses just being metallic accents in the structure itself.  What I remember extremely vividly is that while this object was stationary in mid-air above this two-story house, I could tell it was vibrating in place very strongly.  I watched this object hover over the house for what seemed like a minute, in reality probably only 10-20 seconds, while driving very slowly.  I was fixated on it.  I could not see anything inside the white light emitting from the bottom.  Then the UFO was just gone.  It didn't fly away quickly.  It didn't dart back into the sky above.  It didn't slowly disappear from sight as it got farther away or anything.  It was just gone before my eyes.  I couldn't believe what I had just seen, so I pulled over immediately to document it while it was fresh in my mind.  I opened up Snapchat because was the first thing I thought of to draw with since I had no pen and paper with me; I drew two pictures.  One drawing is of my view, showing my car in relation to the UFO and the tracks, and the other drawing is of the UFO itself with all the detail I could place at the time.  I will be emailing you those two drawings plus a Google Maps image of where I was facing.  I'm telling this now because I've been too afraid to previously.  I've heard about the strange deaths/ disappearances of people who talk about these kinds of first-hand experiences so I was very deterred from telling anyone what I witnessed, even close friends.  I ask that if you choose to contact me, which I'm very open to, please either inform me beforehand or leave a voicemail for me to call you back, because I have a tendency to not pick up for numbers I don't know.

It was only about a 10 to 12 foot with of the house directly where the craft had passed over the night before. I got up my camera and took some video of these odd shaped red droplets.  I even tried to squish one and it seemed like it was blood coming out of it I was weirded out.  I posted it on YouTube and that’s where I get the approximate date of 10 months ago.  To this day’s some of those red spots are still there.  I don’t know if it’s related or not but I found it very interesting.",2020-08-06T00:00:00,47.700352531645564,-116.78960632911392

We had met a younger couple camping on the campsite North of ours and got together as the early morning of the 13th of August 2020 approached. We all had decided we would take in the meteor shower down by the waters edge where viewing would be ideal. We had no light pollution and both campsites fires had not been lit for ideal viewing.  We had a crescent moon due east reflecting off the water.  We watched the meteor shower and shared stories and laughed into the night.  At one point, the women from the campsite two sites to the south, voiced her displeasure with our laughter.  The women also stated it was “two o’clock in the morning!”.  I jokingly, but quietly asked, “exactly?” I then walked up to the truck out of curiosity.  The truck’s clock was 0223.  I walked back and we all were all about to retire when my wife said, “WHAT IS THAT?” We all then turned to the North and approximately 30 Degrees from the horizon moving from west to east was a spinning light between 1500 to 2000 feet AGL. The object was turning in a counterclockwise direction progressively spinning into itself while moving to the east. It also appeared to be disturbing the air around it; creating a cloud or aura that dissipated commensurately with the rate of travel.

I have an M.S. in Information Systems Management and I work as an IT Project Manager for a large local employer, where I have worked for many years.  Report – Occurrence on Aug 17, 2020 Lynnwood, Washington  On the morning of Aug 17, 2020, at 12:31 am, I was awakened in my home in Lynnwood, WA, by a bright yellow-orange light shining into my upstairs bedroom window.  The source of the light was spherical, self-illuminated, approximately 10-20% smaller than a full moon, but much, much brighter.  It seemed like it was shining into my eyes – but it didn’t make me want to blink as it didn’t hurt my eyes.  I stared at the object for about 8 seconds before it blinked out. The window faces west. The orb was stationary, at approximately 175-225 ft in the air depending on how far away it was. (I am estimating its elevation in comparison to the height of some tall conifer trees. It was near the top of one of those very tall trees. If the orb was farther away, then my elevation estimate is probably wrong. I kept looking out the window in case something else happened. A minute or two after the orb blinked out, my window was illuminated with a bright white light. I had blinds pulled down but angled open between each blind so that some light from the sky could come in, and I could see stars on a clear night.  The bright white light illuminated the window for 10-12 seconds before it went out.  I thought it might be someone’s (or even my own) motion-activated light.  But the next day I realized that couldn’t be right because my motion-activated light is not nearly as bright and is set to stay on for 10 minutes.  This light stayed on for 10-12 seconds, then went out, then came back on 4 or 5 minutes later, stayed on for 10-12 seconds again, then went out, then came on a third time, stayed on the same length of time, then went out again.  When the window would light up, it looked like a glowing-white rectangle against a black background—almost like looking at a film negative.  I kept watc! hing the window but the light didn’t come on again while I was watching.  I didn’t get up to look out the window.  I was a bit scared to do that as I didn’t want to attract any attention to myself.  This time period where my window was being illuminated lasted about 20 minutes. I tried to go back to sleep but I tossed and turned and slept fitfully after this. There was a dog outside barking, coming from the same direction as where I saw the orb. It would bark for a while, go quiet, bark some more, and this intermittent barking kept waking me up. I felt like I finally went to sleep and then I was awakened by the dog barking crazily…more intense than before. I opened my eyes and there was that same orange-yellow orb again, in a slightly different position…a little bit north but still shining into my window. I was only able to look at it for about 1 second before it winked out. The way it winked out, it looked like it collapsed inward from the two vertical-ish (  ) sides, so that for a half-second I could see a vertical orange line before it went all the way out. I thought it was strange that as soon as I opened my eyes, there was that orb again, but only for a second. As if to say “Bu-bye!” I looked at my clock again and it was around 3:30-3:35 am.",2020-08-27T00:00:00,47.82361835051547,-122.29480474226804

Last May 10th at 12:17 pm while on a United Airlines flight from Chicago somewhere between St. Petersburg and Sarasota, I took photos of some picturesque cloud formations with my Galaxy S21 Ultra camera that has a state-of-the-art camera. The plane had started it’s descent and was flying at cloud level. A week Later when started looking at the photos, I noticed a tiny white oval Tic-Tac shaped objects along-side the engine of the plane, and another just above it. They looked exactly like the Tic-Tacs the Navy pilots recorded that was released to the media several months ago. As I viewed each photo carefully, I found several Tic-Tacs, and others with oblong shapes that were gray or silverish color. The last photo was at 12:37. By that time the plane must have traveled 20-30 miles. It wasn’t a reflection from the plane’s interior since my phone was pressed against the window. Besides, the ovals in other pictures are seen at different quadrants of the photo frame. If it was from the interior, the ovals would always be in exactly the same place in each photo. Some photos had multiple ovals, or cylindrical shaped objects. Was it a reflection from the ground? I don’t think so because of the various locations in each picture, and the fact that the plane probably traveled 20-30 miles during that time. So if it was a ground reflection that would have to have travel the path of the airplane. Plus, many of the images were next to clouds. I don’t think clouds reflect images from the ground; otherwise, planes would constantly be flying through a mishmash of images reflected on the clouds. Some images were alone in the sky. There is a quick sequence of pictures (not enclosed) taken in relatively the same ground area, and each shows the progression of the ovals moving faster than the plane. I never noticed them when taking the pictures because they were small, I was focused on framing the clouds, and they must have been going faster than the plane. I was able to record these because the camera was set to auto, and since it was pointed at the bright sky, the meta-data on the JPEGs indicates the shutter speeds were from 1/1600 to 1/2000. This may explain why I was able to capture and freeze the image without too much blur; although after enlarging some of the pics, some images did show blurry movement. Enclosed is only a selection of photos. These are some of the highlights. I have many more. The only Photoshop alterations are on some of the JPEGS to crop and enlarge the images, and on a few of the oblong crafts where I tried to sharpen the image to possibly get some detail. If you are interested, I will supply you with all of the photos.",2021-12-19T00:00:00,,

I stepped out the sidedoor of my garage expecting to hear rotors from a chopper because my mind instantly processed chopper. I hear No sound, and I can instantly see it was just above the neighbor’s home about 40 to 50 feet in the air. Not way off in the distance as I first had thought. The beachball sized orb then seemed to swallow or absorb the smaller one. They became one. It hovered. It shrunk to a blip and darted to MY right about 5 feet, expanded big again, darted to the left and then poof, to a blip again, then enlarge again, dart right, flash bright and big and repeat that pattern 4 times. I was just about to throw open the door and yell at my wife to come outside and again, an instinct came that was against that thinking, and I subconsciously knew it would not return so I had better keep watching it.

I go outside as I always do after supper, between 6 or 7. Walk over to my garden and instinct said look up. I saw the greyed out or shaded out bottom of three egg shaped craft, (almost Mandalorian, I swear). Surrounded or escorted by a flock of little ships. My mind immediately processed a flock of Geese until I saw the 3-egg shaped bigger ships. Then my mind was blown and the second my mind processed UFO they went POOF! And every one of the little ships were scattered in a 15-mile radius, above us, in front, each side as far as we can see. They sparkled like diamonds in the sky. The 3 main ships had a sheen about them as the sun reflected blindingly so off their crafts skins. Almost a glassy metal sheen about them. The best way to describe the glow or sunny sheen, blinding reflection would be if you stare at a house window and the sun hits just the right angle its blinding, or driving in a city and the sun blinds you with the reflection off a glassy skyscraper, that’s what it was like. As soon as they scattered, I ran into tell my wife. She came out and began to observe them also. Attempted to take videos but we didn’t have the camera set right. I was observing the 3 main ships via binoculars. I could see the, sun on glass window blinding reflection, but could also make out the shaded shape of the craft. There were 3 mid-sized ships as well. I went to view another craft, this one a triangle with it’s rear at me. I could see 3 colored tubes out the rear, skin of craft was darker. No sun blinding reflection I assume because I was looking at the rear. The tubes on the 1st one where a purple color and the 2nd triangle had white diamond-colored tubes. The 3rd looked more an amber but didn’t see it as much as I was lowering glasses as my wife passed me the camera. I took 1 photo, (hindsight kicking myself I didn’t just snap away in rapid fire), but I wanted to get some video. So, I hit video and captured what I could until suddenly I just realized I should go get neighbors to witness. I ran next door to my neighbors and he came out and watched them with me a bit, through my binoculars to, and he dropped the glassers quickly and said one had zipped through his line of sight and I have a witness statement from him. I then run across the street to another but they were not home and as I gave up the neighbors on the opposite side of me had just returned from dinner. I called them over and they witnessed it as well but have yet to submit a witness statement. My wife and I watched it until the last one left, disappeared or shot off so fast we couldn’t tell. They simply began to just thin out across our view of them. After it was all over, we stood shook, stunned, but for me, a lot of things made sense.",2021-12-19T00:00:00,38.11290000000001,-122.1331

My eyes and head turned to track this object. A flash caught my eye and I turned to look left in its vicinity over my neighbor’s house across the street. A glowing Orb hovering over my neighbor’s home. Suddenly it shot off leaving a streak from low too high for about 30 yards did I see this ""light"" streak/trail. Similar to a shooting star, but shooting stars don’t travel from low to high. Nor hover over a roofline or even at this level. Am I going crazy? It appeared at 4 feet above the roofline, but burned out at 30 feet, a certain degree of angle, no burning debris trail, just a streak, like you wave a glowing light stick through the air super-fast. So, I watched where the streak of light had burned out at its apex because instinct told me to, (at this moment I was thinking of dashing inside and yelling for my wife), and...out of nowhere, I can see depth, neighbor's houses, stars and everything behind it when a bright white light like Orb last Wednesday flashed, then the hole closed.

I am a private pilot myself and we live below an approach into KBFM that is used when the winds are out of the south so I am looking up into the sky quite often to see what types of aircraft are flying.  Being a private pilot with more than 100 hrs flying and an aviation enthusiast in general I am quite competent at identifying aircraft.  My wife is a homemaker with little experience in aviation other than the occasional vacation, but living in our area and like I said under an approach she still sees quite a bit of aircraft.  My location at the time of the sighting was 30 deg 42' 20"" N by 88 deg 8' 10"" W.  I was facing 320 deg. when I first saw it and the object was tracking a SE course.  I looked up into the NW sky and I saw what at first I thought was a small cloud due to the color.  It was very bright.  Then I realized there were no clouds in the sky on this particular day.  It was hard to say what altitude the object was at.  If I was to give a number it would be a total guess.  I began to notice that this object was actually moving across the sky.  It was moving very slowly about the speed a blimp flies.  No way an airplane could fly this slowly and still be able to produce lift.  There was no sound associated with this craft.  My wife and I stood there and watched it until it crossed behind the roof of my house.  So I ran to my front porch to continue watching.  From my front porch I have a massive unobstructed view of the sky.  I can see for miles.  I stood at my front door watching this object for maybe 5 minutes and I decided that given the speed the object was moving I could run inside to grab a drink and return and still see the object.  After quen! ching my thirst I returned to the front porch to find and empty sky.  There was no way at the speed it was traveling that it could have gotten out of my view in the short time I was inside.  The object never reappeared.  I will include pictures I was able to take of the craft.  My pictures will be in the email titled Mobile, AL Sighting.  Some of them are zoomed in and the object looks pretty weird.

I was scheduled to interview prospective students by skype from China so I was driving to campus at about 5:30 am on Friday, Jan. 17, 2020 when I noticed a strange object in a jet black pre-dawn sky.  At first I thought it was clouds partially covering the moon, but the object was far too big for that.  I realized quickly that it looked like a huge floating platform just hovering in the sky above a large shopping center near my house.  It was black and solid, blacker than the dark winter sky, with white, and the occasional red and green lights irregularly placed around it so it looked strange and caught my eye.  Since it was off at an angle and above me, it wasn’t clear if it was a rectangle shape or a triangle.  It looked like a gigantic sound platform like you see at concerts but much bigger than that, hanging silently in the air.  As I drove down the road with the object hovering to my left, I could ! see that it was ridiculously huge hanging there, dwarfing the large shopping center below it.  As soon as I could, I pulled off the road, rolling my window down to hear any sounds.  I couldn’t calculate how high it was in the sky, but I’d say it was somewhere between where a helicopter would fly but well above the top of the shopping center.  It was much bigger than the center and had no sound.  I stared at it for 10 minutes trying to figure out what it was.  I’ve never seen anything like it.  Finally, it silently drifted off beyond the tree line and I drove off to work so I wouldn’t be late for my calls. The next day I googled to see if anyone else had reported this.  No one had, but there were 2 reports from the previous year of having seen a large triangle like that with similar lights in nearby towns at night. When I looked for images on google, the black triangle looked closest to what I saw from the ground. I’m sure I saw something huge and unusual early that morning.

She spent most of her time on the phone while I laid there and watched airplanes crisscross the sky.  There was also some sort of blasting going on at a nearby construction site that was entertaining.  At one point I looked up at the moon, which was clearly visible in the daytime sky, and saw this string of lights underneath it.  The moon was basically south from me and these lights were drifting in an easterly direction.  5 of the lights where white and kind of randomly blinking.  3 of the lights were red. I had the impression these were not emitted lights, but rather were metallic objects reflecting the bright sunlight. The red objects were fire engine red.  They all seemed to be going loosely east together, not in a tight parallel formation, and moving slower than the other airplanes I had seen. I also had the impression they were at higher altitude. ! The odd thing was that two of the objects, one white and one red, where below the other 6, which were roughly in a line. Of the two below, it looked as though the red object had detached from the white object and was trailing behind it. Fairly soon the 6 in a line had faded out and could no longer be seen. This is in perfectly clear skies, no clouds, that had allowed me to see the distinct tube shape of several aircraft from one end of the horizon to the other. The two objects below lingered visible for a bit longer, but eventually the red object faded out. This left the one white object which appeared to curve more southward, moving almost directly away from me, and slowly fade from my view as it got farther away.

Quit appearing after the Mar 13 incident in Phoenix. Over about a two week period I noticed a single light in the sky at about the area of the estrella mountains south west of Phoenix. I thought it odd because I am not aware of any roads or power lines in the Estrella mountains. The light was a yellow light similar in appearance to a low power sodium vapor street light. Observed at about the same angle that the peak of the highest peak of the Estrella mountains would be from my observation point. (I had concluded that because it did not move that somehow someone had installed a street light on top of the Estrella Mtns). I did notice that it would occaisionaly fade out and later reappear in the same spot. This light was last observed on Mar 12 the day before the mutiple lights observed across Arizona. The yellow light description of the multiple lights reminded me of what I had been observing, so I double checked the angles from various reference points where I had observed the light and consistently found that that the locatio!n where I had rembered the light being was further west than where the mountains are located. This would place the light in open sky rather than on one of the peaks.I did observe this light on several different nights at various locations several miles apart. The object's aparent location was consistantly in the same area which would place it approximatly 20 miles south of Luke Air Force Base or about 20 miles ssw of downtown Glendale at an altitude of about 1000 ft (comparable to the nearby mountain peaks).Despite looking for it, this light has not re-appeared since the major event of lights here in AZ",1998-03-07T00:00:00,33.57603490701001,-112.19439241773964

It's shape was that of a carpenter's square set at about 60 degrees, each arm about 300 feet long. My 10 year old son and I had just arrived hope about 8pm and as he waited in the car for me to come around and open the door, he was looking towards the Northwest to see if the comet might still be visible, when he saw a grouping of lights. I looked and what I saw was what looked like at first a pattern of 5 lights in a half oval on its up side. I thought it was a blimp with lights on it. It seemed to be floating but I noticed it was coming directly in our direction. My son went in the house and got my wife, my 13 year old grandson and my 18 year old daughter, to come outside. We all watched these lights approach. Whatever it was it was moving rather slowly. As it came close it no longer had an up-oval shape, but began to look more lie a ""V"" of 5 lights, with one light in the center lead point and two lights on each side. The angle of the ""V"" was not very sharp, maybe 60 degrees.As we stood there watching we were completely flabergasted because it was going to pass directly over our house.  And it did. It passed directly over head maybe a thousand or so feet overhead. Our house is up on the side of a mountain in the Northeast part of Phoenix and we can see pretty far to the northwest and southwest. When it passed overhead we all were looking at it and talking. For one thing, it seemed to float over us and it made absolutely no detectable sound at all.  We were trying to imagine what it was. It certainly couldn't be a group of aircraft flying in formation, because the lights remained absolutely fixed in relationship with each other. As we looked up we could see through the middle of the ""V"" but each arm seemed to be flat shaped like a ruler, and rather long from the first lead light to the tip lights, maybe a couple of hundred feet or more. It was huge.The kids got a little frightened, I suppose because we had no explanation for what we were seeing. We watched it continue to fly towards the southeast until we no longer could see any lights.My background: I am 54 years old, in perfect health. I have a Masters Degree from Columbia University Teacher's College. Formerly worked for IBM as a systems engineer. More recently worked in the electronics repair industry in management. Presently executive in a manufacturing firm. My wife is a secretary at St Mary's Catholic High School. My one daughter is an honor student at the High School. We live up on the side of this mountain and are always looking at the sky, so if we're outside not much is going to go by without us seeing it.

I was visiting my family for several weeks while my husband was chaperoning a high school trip to Europe. This report was written down on July 27, 2016, one day after the sighting: 	 Driving south on I-75 in southern Missouri, we came to a line of dark clouds, but there was no rain or storm. However, as I was in the back seat of the van, looking out of the window to my right, I saw the strangest disk-shaped flashes of light.  I have never seen anything like it and told my Mom to look.  She saw it too. Dad was driving but he said he also saw it a few times out of the corner of his eye. I saw the light between 15-25 times. Sometimes it was behind a very small, light grey cloud. Other times it was in the pale part of the clear sky, and other times in the dark storm clouds, but I only ever saw it in one place at a time. It appeared to move south, towards the dark cloud line, faster than we were driving south. However, sometimes it appeared to have “backtracked” a bit. The light itself never moved, but each time it appeared, it appeared further to the south, faster than we were driving. The light was exceedingly bright and blinding, and exceedingly quick, flashing for only an instant and disappearing. Wherever it appeared—-behind a small light grey cloud, in the clear sky, or in the dark clouds—-it was an elongated disk or elongated diamond shape, like this: (Note: There is a hand-drawn picture here in my original account), and it was quite large in the sky. It was so bright and so fast and very frightening for both reasons. It did NOT “light up the clouds” li! ke lightning or heat lightning, but it was so bright that it seemed to shoot out its blinding white light all the way to me in the van. It was as bright as the sun, if you were to look at the sun, but it was not near the sun, even though the sun was still brightly shining in the clear part of the sky. Both Mom and I tried to film it on our iPhones.  I took a video longer than a minute, during which Mom and I both saw the light multiple times, but it does not show up in the video.  Strangely, after watching the video later, I did see a very quick, bright flash that appears for an instant on the telephone poles as we whiz past them in the video.  In reality, the light was up in the sky, and not on the telephone poles.  However, we think that the light was perhaps a type of St. Elmo’s Fire or similar natural phenomenon, and my own guess is that the light did shoot from the sky to the tops of the telephone poles, which is why it appeared so blinding to me from the van, and why it appears on the telephone poles in the video footage.  It was very, very strange looking, whatever it was. At one point, Dad even pulled over along the freeway so that we could all watch for the light, but we did not see it at all while pulled over.",2020-07-31T00:00:00,,

During this time, I was visiting with my slightly older cousin, who only lived five minutes away at my aunt and uncle's house, which is also in the suburbs.  He lived in his parents' basement, which had a door leading to their backyard, and it overlooked a small field.  While hanging out, we would frequently use the door to go outside and smoke cigarettes, as we were both heavy cigarette smokers at the time.  On this particular occasion, my cousin and I were in his parents' backyard smoking cigarettes and conversing as usual, when all of a sudden, my cousin stopped mid-conversation, and proceeded to point to the sky, and he began to exclaim: ""Oh......oh......oh....my....God!""  I immediately looked up to see a glowing green craft that was more oval-shaped that spherical.  The color of the craft was gorgeous, and I can only describe its color as a bioluminescent! green.  The craft was flying over the field that the backyard overlooked.  Then, it accelerated at a high rate of speed until we could no longer see it.  What I also found interesting, was that the craft gained even more speed when it emitted a small flame that was approximately halfway between the bottom and back of the craft.  The flame was comparable to a rocket or a jet, which was yellowish/orange/red.  When the craft began to emit the flame, my cousin and I could even hear the ""ppffffftttttt"" sound that the jet-like flame was making due to the fact that it was approximately 2:00 A.M. and its almost always quiet that late at night in the Delaware suburbs.  P.S.:  Approximately 1 to 2 years after this particular sighting, I had witnessed a similar craft (bioluminescent green, oval-shaped) on two other occasions; however, on both occasions I was alone on my parent's deck smoking cigarettes late at night, so there would be no one to corroborate my story for those other two sightings.  The other two sightings were even quicker than the sighting I had with my cousin; and had occurred within 6 months of each other.  P.P.S.:  Roughly 2 years ago, my cousin (who witnessed the craft with me in my first account) and his father (my uncle) witnessed a silver cube-shaped craft in broad daylight while they were working in their garage.  During this sighting, my cousin took a picture of it on his phone, and I will make sure to get the picture from him.  I can personally attest to the existence of this picture, as it depicted this silver cube-shaped craft that had a long grayish / smoke-like trail behind it.  The trail was almost cigar-shaped, and it emitted from the back of the craft.  My cousin and uncle stated that the craft was moving at a high rate of speed, and it appeared to disappear along with the long trail in an instant.  My uncle is an avid airplane enthusiast who once had a pilots license.  He frequently enjoys looking up at the sky and identifying the airplanes that are flying about by their appearance and sound.  He told me that he had never seen anything like this, and both him an! d my cousin seemed extremely perplexed and somewhat uncomfortable with what they saw.  Every now and then, I bring up their sighting of the cube-shaped craft during family get-togethers, and they both get slightly uncomfortable; but, I believe that I could get them to report their experience on this website.",2020-07-31T00:00:00,39.65195779310345,-75.71214262068966

Disappeared within minutes of each other after traveling north. I came outside to gauge the weather to see if the sky cleared, as it was overcast earlier, it was now a solid grey high ceiling with not even a breeze or gust of wind. The overcast provided bright gray backdrop which the red/orange circles stood out against. I immediately noticed two red lights with orange centers heading north. No sound was heard from the objects moving relatively fast similar to a plane but not as fast as one. The two separate circles which appeared a meter apart from my point of view on the ground. Initially, I thought it was a reflection on my glasses but it wasn't as they were around my neck. I observed and noted that these objects were definitely not our usual airplanes.  Living on Long Island the flights, currently, fly low across Long Island east to west on the south shore heading to Kennedy or LaGuardia. Normal commercial flights that travel south (up the coast) north across Long Island, as the 2 orange circles did, but at a higher altitude as they are heading towards Connecticut using Robert Moses water tower as a landmark to cross Long Island. The red orange circles followed a similar path but on a slight angle no greater than 10° west at a lower altitude. There was absolutely no engine sound or buzz from a drone which our neighbors fly frequently. I put my glasses on and by the time I looked up one had disappeared maybe 20 seconds. The overall distance covered was at best estimate was somewhere between Montauk Hgw and Union Blvd past Southern State. I don't believe it reached Long Island Expressway before the second one just disappeared. After, September 11, the sky above Long Island was constantly monitored by our military. There were similarly spaced however these apoeared side by side not the usual one aircraft leading. Depending on the direction some of those aircrafts appeared to have a solid red light but never in the path these 2 red orange circular objects traveled.

Coming towards towards me, so probably heading toward the South/South East. After I went outside, on my porch. I looked around the side of my house (North/Northeast facing). Again, to check for Animals. And I saw the aircraft heading in my direction.  But this time, It seemed characteristically different. The tint was the normal yellow-ish.  Like from an airplanes guiding light.  But yet, there was still no emergency light blinking. The craft then seemed to be almost above my house, at the normal altitude of the regular aircraft's in my area. (And it seemed to be on the normal flight path too.)  Then all of a sudden. IT STOPPED. Midair. Stayed there for about 30 seconds. It got brighter, and looked to now be an orange tint light. (I tried to get a video, but my phone was in the wrong mode.) And before I could gather any sound evidence. The craft LITERALLY went back the way it came, and disappeared. No U-Turn. IT just stopped, Mid-Flight. Went dimmer, and shot off the way it came. That was it.  The whole encounter lasted about 3-5 minutes.  (I'm also counting from when I first saw it through my north facing window before going outside.)

My mother in law said, “What is that in the sky?”  Just seconds after discussion of the comet that was supposed to be visible that night.  We all looked up and saw a white cylindrical object high in the sky.  I am a private pilot and I would estimate the object to be around 20,000ft to 30,000ft or possibly even higher in the sky.  It appeared to be above the cirrus clouds. The sky was blue except for a few clouds.  The object did not move at all and stayed in the same exact spot for about thirty minutes.  It was eventually obstructed by cirrus clouds as they moved under the object.  We attempted to take photos of the object but none of the photos came out clear enough.  I wondered if it was a star or planet, however the sun was not set yet and there! were no other objects or stars anywhere else in the sky.  This object looked very much out of place.  I questioned if it was a weather balloon but like I stated above, the object never moved from this spot.  It never appeared larger or smaller as if it was ascending or descending.  It stayed completely still and the size did not appear to change.  It was white in color, assuming it was reflecting sunlight and we were unable to properly identify the color.  Several hours later, my friend sent me a screenshot of the object that someone took in Johnstown, NY. About 15 minutes south of our position.  This picture was much more clear than our blurry photos and the object looked more like and unidentified flying object.  Not just a weather balloon.  This object did not make any noise.

There were no flashing lights, no sound, no contrail, and no definitive shape to it other than a single bright light.

It traveled up and East then seemed to head South away from us, faded quickly and disappeared within 30 seconds from when we first saw it.

As we watched it directly overhead, 3 of us saw a third bright light appear in front and to the right of the plane. The three of us jumped up at the same time to get a better look. The light was maybe a little higher than where the plane was flying and moved in front of the plane from right to left (northwest direction) and not straight but around the nose of the plane as if avoiding it. Then the light quickly faded to red and disappeared. Later that night I was heading inside the house just before 11:00pm and in the sky to my northeast this time i saw a forth bright light as the one first described traveling in the same eastern trajectory in the exact same fashion.

The movement was too slow to indicate a meteor, and it was almost as bright as Venus in the night sky, although the wrong location.  It was also far too bright to be a satellite, generally speaking; and because it also had a significant period of no movement, it appears that it would not be a satellite.

We walked the short distance to the other end of the lake and started to fish.  We were catching fish every cast, so very preoccupied with excitement.  My son, looked up and noticed it first (he is three years old).  A plane was flying close to the object.  I looked at my mom and asked, “what is that?” The plane kept moving and the object was at a dead standstill. There were hardly any clouds in the sky, so it was not a reflection of anything.  It was oval/oblong and glowing white.  I was able to get pictures of it, but they don’t do it justice.  My phone battery went down to 1 percent quickly, so I was only able to capture a couple pictures.  It stayed above us for about 20 minutes and then just like that, gone.  We must have looked down for just a brief moment and then looked back up and it was gone.  It was larger than a plane, because the plane flew by it and it was just a bit larger than that (depending on how close to us it was compared to the plane) but to the blind eye it appeared to be bigger than a jet.  It stayed put, not moving at all, for about 20 minutes and then disappeared.  I posted a comment about it on social media and my phone started to blow up with other people having similar reports this week and previously.  One was a man that works for Game and Fish.  He saw it on Tuesday (August 11, 2020) and at night.  He said he went to go investigate what the light was over the ridge (same area I saw it), and he said that his phone wouldn’t work when he tried to take a picture, almost as if it was scrambled.  He also reported that there was a vibration on the ground below him.  Another resident of Centennial wrote and said she saw the same thing, around 5pm early in the week, and that she looked up with her husband while driving and said, “wow, a UFO!” and that she was almost “so mesmerized that she couldn’t take a picture” – she’s a professional photographer, so this is really odd for her. Prior to this sighting (which is the first time I have ever witnessed something like this), I had an overwhelming feeling of joy.  Like a flood of joy just overwhelmed my body – it’s hard to describe.  I have been going through an incredibly difficult time and so joy isn’t something that I have experienced full-on in a while.  This feeling was immense and strong.  Not sure if its related, but I believe that it is.  It looks like that was a similar sighting (recorded on video) over a ranch near there on November 6, 2019 and that was posted on LaramieLive (a local news source online).  There have been several other reports from Centennial residents and it sounds like they are all in the same area, so I am finding out any way.  I did call our local airport and asked if the pilot in the plane had reported anything suspicious.  They said they would get back to me.  Incredible.",2020-08-20T00:00:00,,

I am the head of a household of four individuals: myself (age 36), my wife (age 36), and my two young daughters (ages 7 and 5).  In mid-March of 2019, our family began construction of a home in a new residential area on the outskirts of the city of Surabaya, Indonesia.  Our property faces south, and is in direct view of a nearby volcano called Mount Penanggungan.  One night, as our family was visiting the construction site, I turned and looked toward the volcano and saw three distinct lights in the distance moving in a slight side-to-side pattern.  All three lights were alternating colors, from red to blue-green, and were positioned high in the sky, above any transmission towers in the vicinity.  Moreover, there was a faint buzzing/humming sound that I could hear emanating from that direction.  I asked my family to verify what I was seeing and hearing, which all of them did promptly.  Over the course of a year, I observed the lights on two more occasions when I visited the property at night to check the progress of construction, but not always in a group of three. The lights never appeared during the day, and there were no towers tall enough or far enough off to produce the lights. When we finally moved into the home in April of this year (2020), I began seeing the lights almost every other night, but not always in the same location. Sometimes one light would appear to the west, while other times the same kind of flashing light would show up in the east, but by far the most common place of sighting was to the south, near the volcano. The movement of the lights also changed. Often times the lights would move in a circular pattern, and other times would appear to fall and rise repeatedly over the course a few seconds and then remain still for an extended time, only to do so again and again over several hours.  Last night (13 August 2020), what I can only describe as a singular craft with multiple flashing lights in very close proximity to each other appeared to the south. It was quite close, closer than I had ever witnessed before, and it gave off a low, pulsing, buzzing sound. The lights flashed white, red, and blue-green, and the craft seemed to be rotating. I couldn’t make out the exact shape of the craft, but the lights did not at all resemble those of airplanes, helicopters, or power towers. Seeing the craft so near to my home alarmed me, and I felt a need to report it.",2020-08-20T00:00:00,,

Our city experienced a double rainbow and of course everyone was looking at it and took to social media (I say this because I might not be the only one who saw it but idk). But that's when I noticed a single, VERY bright light that was small (my first initial thought was a plane or maybe a satellite). You could tell it was far away. It stuck out like a sore thumb. The brightness of the light was different and that's when I decided to watch it because I've never seen something like this. From my perspective, it started to moved towards the rainbow. It wasn't moving erratically and not necessarily in a straight line, but instead in a smooth fluid motion regardless if it was gaining or losing altitude. And it was moving fast considering how far away it was.  It's nowhere as fast as a shooting star but it was definitely way too fast to be a plane. Once it got to t! he rainbow, it stopped and sat motionless for maybe a minute or two. It then started to move back in the same direction it came from. Definitely never seen a plane do that. This whole time while I'm watching this light, the light was going in and out. Not flashing in and out, more like dimming. It wasn't sequential or in a pattern, you couldn't time it. It was completely random. Sometimes it would vanish for a split second up to a few seconds. And sometimes the light got brighter all the way up to an obnoxious bright. This went on for about 15 to 20 until I lost sight due to the tree line. A few moments later, I saw AN ACTUAL PLANE in the same general area as I just saw the light. The plane was very visible and I could easily make out the main components of it, as well as seeing and identifying the familiar flashing lights in perfect unison that all planes have.

August 19, 2020 @ 9:47 pm Rural Eastern Ohio  While taking the trash can to the curb. I noticed a pair of odd flashing lights in the night sky, traveling west to east in a straight trajectory at a slow but constant speed.  The event lasted a little more than a minute before the lights disappeared behind the trees. The bright white lights were flashing in unison and similar to anti-collision strobe lighting on an aircraft. But there were no red or green directional lights observed, just the two very bright flashing lights.  I was a bit stunned at first. But then I remembered I had my mobile phone in my pocket. I took it out and attempted to record the object. I say object because the two lights appeared to maintain the same distance from one another the whole time.  The lights also appeared to be at a lower altitude than normal nighttime air traffic for this area. At one point I thought that it might be some type of consumer drone. But there wasn’t the telltale buzzing sound that a drone makes. It also appeared that the lights were quite large. At the angle that I was viewing them, I’m guessing that they were somewhere near a thousand feet AGL (above ground level). Therefore being too big to be a drone. There was a slight low rumbling sound during the sighting. If it were a standard aircraft flying at that altitude it would have been easily discernible.  Though my video was a bit shaky, I did manage to capture footage of the flashing lights. I also pulled a still from the video. When enlarged, it clearly shows the two individual lights.  As far as I know I was the only witness to this event. Our neighbors were outside at the time having an argument (which was captured on the video’s audio track). But I believe they were too immersed in their confrontation to notice the lights.  Our property is located about 2 miles east of a small city and these lights were traveling from that direction. About 3 miles to the south west is a small municipal airport. These lights did not take the normal flight path that local aircraft make on approach or departure.  I’m a retired security lieutenant and I used to work night security at a factory adjacent to that airport. I have seen countless aircraft on approach at night. These lights did not match anything that I have seen before. I’m also a hobbyist UAS (unmanned aerial systems) pilot. I’m familiar with drones and their flight characteristics. Which is why I do not believe this was a drone.  I still have no idea what I witnessed on the night of August 19th 2020 @ 9:47 pm. It has come to my attention that a sighting of a similar object occurred that same day approximately 12 hours earlier in the Cleveland Ohio area.

I am also a Coast to Coast subscriber who, up until now, has never witnessed and unidentifiable sighting in my 10,000 hours of flying. Due to the unusual nature of this event, the crew tried to capture as many details as possible. While flying from Richmond VA to our hub, the crew noticed a satellite looking object bearing NW, moving what appeared to be easterly. The object was approximately three fingers high from the horizon. The object was devoid of any beacon, strobe or other flashing lights. At first, the object was a dim white light but in the span of about 15 seconds, it went from dim to a very noticeable bright white light and then dim to out of sight. This event was soon followed by a succession of about 15 more of the same sighting for a total of 16 observed. Duration total of event was about 9 minutes. The observation began at Fl 300 and persisted during our descent until about 13,000ft. We believed the succession of events ceased but they may well have continued as we were getting closer to our city base and the preponderance of lights made the night sky more ablaze. The first object was observed at 03:30z and the 16th object was observed 03:39z. The spacing between objets seemed to be consistent and on-time. The speed appeared to consistent with that of a satellite moving across the sky. It was difficult to ascertain the height above Earth but all objects occurred at the same altitude which was noted at about three fingers above the horizon. The objects location were noted at a 330 degree bearing from our airplane and our heading was 270 degrees.  ** crew hypothesized that these were either a result of private enterprise technology or from the military.

Saturday 7-31-21 11:42p.m. My friends came to see me again tonight. Knew it, (I think they've been talking to me, memories, words...long story), 2 sets of doves came by, some land, some sit in the tree across the road and some pairs that just circled. This is 3 nights in a row. Last night, I ask them to mend my heart...our agreement, ""They"" flash a star just like last night, a pure white colored, bowed like a kite, star shaped light! Tonight was amazing, I said OK...you confirmed your desire and agreed to mine, I asked for a tiny orb in my hand.... got tinker bell,(what I call a series of flashes I witness in the sky many times, some as many as 13 flashes)...and a little later a star, and I said if you can’t put an orb in my hand how bout planted thoughts and such. Oh, I get that in spades now. All day yesterday I recieved images, thoughts, smells, memories, letters and words. Before my wife got home and after and in front of. I had a visitor over today for 5 hours, and it felt good cause they stopped all images, words etc... during those hours. Had a hunch this was going to be a big night. I start ce5 at 6, ask for something bigger, like beckoning them to come out of the clouds and closer...nothing, watch Olympics, go out at 10...ce5, I do everything in 3's when I perform CE5 meaning dots and dashes of threes.! <-- A bright light, diamond white appears over my right shoulder up in the sky, my 1st thought...satellite. Looks, acts, travels in a straight line. Traveling South to North, maintaining elevation. But then I notice the location/elevation. Not high enough at all, airplane height at best if that. Tell my wife about the sighting after I can’t see it anymore. No sooner than when I get back outside into position the very same light appears from the same direction I had lost sight of it from in the North, it flew/glided and went off over my right shoulder till I couldn't see it anymore. North to South, the exact same line it was on when it traveled South to North. I tell my wife again, so that she can help me remember details. So suspicious. I go out back sliding door after telling my wife, she’s watching the Olympics, when I round the corner of the back of our home where the Big Dipper is on my horizon. I see a bright light just like the two that flew by. I can’t believe my eyes! NO WAY! When “nameless” said they were shouting at me, they are. WTH is happening here?? I thought at first, it’s the big dipper arm star, should be right, then my eyes adjust and see the arm star I'm referring to in the background and this light looks like it's directly approaching me! Watch long enough to determine it is indeed flying straight at me. And it’s NOT a satellite. It’s blinking and shifting shape. I grab my binoculars and can see two elongated, rectangular bright light like windows, and between the lights is a blank black area. I grab my somewhat better camera I’ve had for years and mounted on a tripod earlier. I hit record and held in my hand trying to capture what before you I have captured. In the beginning, you can see the big dipper arm star faintly twinkling. Freeze frame it and Walla. Especially at the end. There’s a lot of dead space because I ran to get my wife, it was directly over us headed southeast. (I’ve since edited and shortened that video and will share both original and edited copy. I yelled for my wife and she came running out the back sliding door. My wife looked up and saw it as it passed over the rear of our home. I had this sudden feeling, HURRY honey, that it would stay just long enough for her to confirm the sighting. Soon as she was saying, oh yea right there it started to fade. I saw it go out, my wife said she saw it flash a reddish hue a few times before she could not see it anymore. (I was not able to upload the original video as it is quite long but it is available to you if you need it).",2021-12-19T00:00:00,38.11290000000001,-122.1331

We were driving home and notice the car in front of us coming from the other direction was flashing there high beams non stop. The driver of the vehicle I was in started to slow down, and while I was talking to the driver he was looking at the sky in front of the vehicle. And asked me “ what is that”? I looked up and directly in front of us was 5 lights like a car high beam flashing at us. The lights were in a straight line, one on the outside either side and 3 in the middle. But it was coming right at us right so the driver asked is that a plane, with real concern. Next thing the lights went out, it honestly looked like it was coming to land on the road. The sky was completely dark, We both looked at each other with confusion not sure what we just seen. A couple seconds later this giant sphere with two standing columns on either side of it was gliding fairly slow over the trees just off the road, on the passenger side. sphere had those same 3 lights on the bottom, and the flashed every couple seconds like a plane but bright white. Now when those 3 lights flashed the two columns on the sides lit up from the bottom of the column and went straight up to the top, then this flash came down from the top like a lighting bolt to the bottom of the column. It was like a very light purple colour. And it would do that repetitively while it was gliding over the trees. When it lit up the colums were like transparent, I can see into them. I rolled the window down and you couldn’t hear a sound from this thing. It was not far away maybe 30-40 ft away from me, litterally hovering the tree line. And when it lit up you can see this enormous sphere clear as day. It was no plane or anything I’ve ever seen. Im know artist but I drew what I seen on a piece of paper. We were driving a ford transit double decker. The sphere alone was almost as big as the truck. We got to see this thing glide for about a minute. Because we were going the opposite dirty.

But there were cars behind us that were turning back, it was like a convoy before this thing showed up. But We kept driving even stopped for a few minutes no cars passed us. So we’re sure at least a few of them had turned around to follow it.. I was not going to do this, because this is the type of thing to make someone seem crazy. But from research of passed UFOs being scene. There is nothing like this!!

On the night of September 27, 2021 I was going on a night drive on the Blue Ridge Parkway. It was just me in the car. I accessed the Parkway at Aho Gap, which is milepost 288, and drove south towards Linville. I left at 10:00 p.m. and was home by 10:40. I will acknowledge now that this was a normal time for me to be up and active. I work second shift at a hotel and am usually up until midnight or until 1 a.m. I do not know at what specific point I saw the three red lights, I just remember looking straight ahead and seeing them. I remember I passed Cone Manor (milepost 294) and Julian Price Park (milepost 297) and saw the lights before the Linville Viaduct (milepost 304). The lights were large in diameter and had an aura around them that was the same color. I initially thought they were the lights of the radio tower of Black Mountain (around milepost 342.2), which can be seen on the side of a mountain far ahead. However, these lights were straight ahead of my car. I remember thinking, “That’s weird, I’ve never seen them straight in front of me before.” I was also not on the Parkway long enough to be anywhere near the radio tower lights. It would take me over an hour to reach them going 30-35 mph and I was only on the Parkway for roughly 40 minutes. That includes the return time. But I did not think much of it beyond that, until I went out again the next night with my sister. Not much further ahead, the lights disappeared and then they were right outside my car. They appeared between the front passenger side window and the right side of my windshield, and I was above the road. It felt like I was driving above them (not directly above, but to the left, since I could see the lights through the front right windows of my car), and then I was turned around on the Parkway to head back in the direction of Aho Gap. It is difficult to describe this part. I wrote down everything that happened when I got home so I would not have to rely on memory. However, this event is hard to describe because when I was at an overlook that I did not pull into (Grandmother Overlook, milepost 307.4) I could not remember turning into it. Whenever I tried to remember, I just got flashes of driving over the red lights. Since I was facing the direction home (north), I decided to return home. It felt later than it was, I could have sworn I got home after 11 p.m. and closer to midnight, but I texted my sister when I got home and I was home at the latest by 10:40 p.m. I thought it was my own decision to turn around at that point and head home, so I did. On the way back, I was not sure which way I was driving. I knew I turned out of Grandmother Overlook but I could not tell if I was driving towards home or away from it. I frequently drive the Parkway, even at night, and I always drive south since I am more familiar with that direction and I can easily recall how much farther until I can turn down Aho Road (via Aho Gap). The frequency of which I drive the Parkway is anywhere from two to four nights a week from June to October. Even when I reached Julian Price Park, I had to think and remind myself if it was always on the left side of the road when I return home (it is). I felt calm during all of this on the night of the 27th. However, I saw faces in the trees that looked like the typical greys, but their faces were stretched. I thought my eyes were tired and I was making faces out of nothing, so I moved my eyes around and the faces were still there. I looked directly at one, since if it is difficult to make something out clearly from my peripheral vision and I look directly at it I will see it for what it is. But the faces were still there, they were not made out of the leaves in the trees, they were superimposed on the leaves. I was calm on the way home but felt like there was someone in my car. I do not know if that feeling is relevant to answering anything about what happened that night, or if it paints a bigger picture. I just wanted to get this somewhere where someone might know what to do with it, because I cannot get the experience out of my head. I have also attached images that I drew to better explain it and document it without relying on memory alone. The images were drawn on September 29th, since I did not think twice about what happened two days before, until I was on the Parkway with my sister on September 28th. It was not until that second night out that I realized it would have been impossible for me to have driven anywhere near the Black Mountain Radio Tower in 20 minutes. I drew the initial sight of the three lights, then I drew what it looked like when they were by my car, and then I drew what I saw on the way home.

My first thought, due to the proximity of RDU airport, this was a 747, or some other very large aircraft either landing or crashing. I realized this was not the case, due to the object making no sound. I turned and drove up Vision Dr., while watching the object continue in a south easterly direction, close to downtown Apex. As I watched, the object changed direction, shifting north. The object did not bank, but merely shifted North while remaining horizontal. Very bizarre. When I got home, I called the Apex police department, asking about any known low flying aircraft in the area. Apex was celebrating an Oktoberfest festival that evening, and I thought maybe it could be related, formation night flying or some other “show”. Their answer was no, no scheduled traffic. This week (Thanksgiving) I found a commercial aviation radar app that has flight histories and whatnot (Flightradar24). There were no commercial or civilian flights recorded at that time on October 30, where I was driving. For this reason, I’m making the report. In conclusion, the object was very large, flying low, slow and without sound. I saw no details of the airframe or other structure, due to the brightness of the lights. The lights were arranged in a “4” square pattern (which I reasoned maybe what 4 light aircraft flying in close formation would look like). All I remember is red and white, with 2-4 very bright white strobes. As another report on this same evening stated, this was a very busy highway and time of evening, with lots of traffic.

The Objects were a solid white with NO strobes or any dimming. Upon seeing the first in the string of 5 It appeared to be a low orbiting satellite. Then I saw number 2, then 3, 4, 5 and possibly 6. They maintained a constant speed to stay the same distance between all of them. If I was guessing (from my POV) they were at 40-60,000 FT AGL and based on their size and speed, they were ALL maintaining approximately a 2 miles separation from each other.  But again they looked like satellites and from everything I have seen and know with an 18 year career in Military Intelligence satellites do not fly in a trail formation with only minimal separation between them.  They looked like satellites but were so much brighter and I have NEVER seen satellites traveling in a trail formation (especially) not traveling in a group or trail formation. Each object was maintaining the EXACT path as the previous as I was able to use a star behind them to verify the flight path .  As they moved further East they dimmed until they were out of visual sight. I called the Tower at MCI and have been checking ALL flight record sites to see if anything was up at that time and have not found anything.  I have NEVER seen anything that I could not explain. IF they were Military aircraft (as we have Whitman AFB East of us and Omaha North) they were NOT showing the common single red strobe or solid red light.  Further more they had NO sound that one would hear upon observing a high altitude Aircraft and with the weather being cold there was NO contrail.  If I had only seen one, I would have said it was a satellite. But 5-6 in a row all maintaining a perfect trailing formation with each other leads me to believe that they were not Satellites.

Observed streaking object leaving one orb and traveling at a high rate of speed in a horizontal manner and leaving a ""tail"" or ""trail"" behind (much like a meteor, but in a straight path).  The lights extinguished quickly with no fading of ""fizzling-out"". I have been observing these ""lights"" since approximately August/September, 1996.  I live approximately 4 miles north of Buckeye and in an area that is in a diaganol line approximately 15 - 20 miles south/southwest from Luke Air Force Base.  The first night we observed the lights back in the fall, they appeared due South of my home.  There were three large orbs and were yellow/white in color.  I called to my roomate to come and see and she observed them at that time.  We concluded they were flares of some sort.  However, they disappeared very quickly, as if a switch had been turned off.  A few moments later, they appeared, all at once, in a location several miles to the west of the original sighting.  We were not at all convinced that these lights were unexplainable, and we were mildly curious.The second sighting was perhaps a week later, with the same type of behavior.  This time, however, I retrieved my binoculars and both my roomate and myself wathced the lights for several minutes.  It appeared that there was heat emanating from the orb...we thought it might be smoke, but it appeared more to be like radiant heat.  We assumed that if it was a flare of some time, it would gradually burn out, but once again it exstinguised itself very rapidly and we did not observe it again that night.In visiting with my new neighbors, I asked whether they had seen these lights and they had not.  However, a week or so later, once again they appeared (in the same location), and I called them and had them come outside to observe with myself and my roomate.  They confirmed the sighting, and also thought that perhaps it was some type of flare.  The also observed the heat radiating from the orbs.  They disappeared as before.I am not a very good judge of distance or size, but if I were to estimate the size of these object in relation to the night sky, I would say they appeared to be the size of 1/2 dollar piece.  They have appeared in numbers of 3, 4 and in a configuration of 3 with 2 to west side.I remember two other occasions in which I observed these lights and began to feel that it was some sort of Air Force exercise or some other explainable phenomena.The night of March 13, 1997, I was driving from Phoenix, west on I-10.  I had left town at approximately 7:45 p.m., and am guessing it was around 7:20 to 7:25 that I began to notice the lights.  I remember thinking that the lights were in a different position that I had observed them before.  They were more closely situated near the Estrella Mtns (west side) and seemed to be moving.  Before, I had only observed them being stationery.  It did not really dawn on me that they were moving until I turned South off of the interstate and began traveling south.  I realized that the lights had moved to the location I was used to seeing them...approximately 20 miles west of the Estrella Mts.By the time I was within one mile of my home, I began to sense that these lights were moving much more erratically than I had previously observed.  They had moved even further west (it was approximately 7:25 - 7:30 by this time) and suddenly I saw the streaking object seemingly coming from one of the larger orbs (there were 3 at this time) and move VERY rapidly horizontally across the sky (to the northwest I believe).  It seemed there was a tail of sparks or matter coming from this smaller object and I can only compare it to a meteor, although I am certain it was NOT a meteor (it moved in a straight line and then went out very quickly some distance from the orb). I ran into the houseand summoned my roomate, but by the time we went outside, all signs of the objects were gone.I began asking people at work back in Aug/Sept if they had seen any of these lights.  I suppose they thought I was a bit touched, but now that this major sighting has occured, they are remembering the days I came in with details of what I had seen the night before.  I wish I would have known how to contact someone back then.I am a Data Processing Assistant (15 years) with a large school district in Phoenix.

It was brighter than the stars, and too high for a tower light, no skyscrapers in this area, mentally I eliminated what it wasn't.

Im not sure whether I blinked and missed something orthe object just moved up very fast.  I could see that the bright white light was a cluster of 3 lights.  Itmoved to the far left as if circling and moved out in front but below the cluster object.  I assumed thiswas something examining the larger object, possibly an USAF jet.  My mind curiously questioned,if the smallerobject is a jet what in the world could the big thing be?  The smaller craft (size of a tack)  stayed out frontfor a while.

I noticed its approach and then realized that it had a unusual, triangular-shaped aircraft flying close and to the left of its tail.  This craft? was about 1/4 the size of the UAL plane, triangular-shaped, flat, light grey color. Why? On Feb. 17, I was returned from Chicago on a United Airlines flight to Ontario, CA at about 10AM in the morning. We were flying at about 32,000 feet and the weather conditions were very clear.  Approaching us from the south going north and a bit easterly, I noticed another aircraft flying beneath us.  I am no expert, but I could identify the aircraft as a UAL aircraft. What originally got my attention was that it didn't seem too far beneath our flight and it seemed so clear because of the lack of clouds, dust, etc.  Then, I noticed that something (another craft?) was tagging along with it, rather close and off the left side of the UAL's tail.  When I looked closer, I couldn't figure out what it was or why it was following so closely.  I am not sure of the model of the UAL aircraft, but the ""unknown"" flying with it was about a quarter of the UAL's size, triangular shaped, point forward (but the forward point was slightly rounded toward the tip).  Its color was a flat, light g!rey - not shiny as a usual, unpainted aircraft would be.  It was as though the two crafts were flying in formation - that close.I keep them plain in sight until they had passed completely beneath our flight.There is probably a logical explanation for this, but it seemed very strange to me and when I review the sight in my mind, it still seems strange.   Others on the plane may have noted it, but no one else mentioned it.  I was sitting in a row next to a window, just forward of the leading edge of the aircraft, by myself.  My husband picked me up at the airport in Ontario and I mentioned it to him right away.  He guessed maybe it was some kind of target or balloon, but it did have some depth to it, yet nothing on top that I could see which might be like a raised cockpit area, nor did it have any tail(s) or projections, nor any indentation on the back edge like I have seen on some experimental aircraft.

I was taking the dogs out before bed (I'mnot exactly sure what the time was, around 2100 I think)and I looked to the north and saw 5 very bright white lightsin a triangle (or V) formation moving really fast southeast.Then they broke formation.  The light in the back and below(from my angle) slowed up.  Now I started to wonder what I waslooking at because most planes would keep formation or at leastbreak formation completely.  Never saw a plane with lights asbright as these also.  The group seemed to rotate 90 degrees tothe left and go a little south of Mingus mountain.  I was suprisedthat I couldn't hear them so I listened harder.  I did hear thesound of a faint rustling in the sky, not like a jet, but of somethinmoving extremely fast through the air.  The sound was a ways behindthem also and did seem to follow them.  I then started lookingaround at two other planes flying.  Sessna's by the sound andspeed of them.  Also by the red flashing lights.  I saw the lights fadeinto the distance and I headed back inside.  My first notion was whathas our government got up there?  New stealth technology?  Then whythe lights?  I also thought the lack of sound could have been some formof some top secret frequency cancellation system that the governmentis checking out.  But still, why the lights?It didn't hit home that these could possibly be UFO's until I heardpeople talking about it on Friday.  Then I knew I had seen somethingthat was definately unexplainable.

Stops, hovers, and speeds away later. We witnessed a very bright reflective white/silver orb, flying very high, following alongside a big 4 engine 737 type plane.  It was directly overhead and it was a very clear sunny day.  It appeared to be about 1/4 of the plane's size.  The plane had very strong contrails and the weather was warm, so it was at least flying at probably 20,000 feet. My attention was first drawn to the jet because of the thick contrails.  It was directly overhead as I laid down on the grass in the park to relax a cramp in my back that I have been suffering after poor home office ergonomics (Covid 19 lock down). The UFO was following southbound about 5 plane lengths, dashing through the contrails, in and out for about 15 seconds (from the point I laid down and noticed it).  Then it went out along side the plane and followed it for about another 15-20 seconds, and then it just completely stopped (now about 20-30° away from the zenith).  It up stayed in place for about a minute before a small dense cumulus cloud passed between view.  (Confirming it is at least 10,000 feet and likely higher, since it was in the contrails before). 2-3 minutes later when it passed, it was still there. It stayed there for about 10 minutes, not moving.  The plane now was long gone.  I pointed it out to another man in the park and we watched it together.  Suddenly, it accelerated towards the north-east extremely fast, at least 3-4 times the speed the plane was going earlier, instantaneously!  In maybe 5 seconds it was out of sight.  I had chills and tears, and still do writing this now.  It was clearly an object at a high altitude, performing very unusual and quite impossible flight maneuvers. Afterwards, I scoured social media and newspapers for any other sightings but didn't find any to my surprise because it was so obvious to me.  But then again, not too many people are staring straight up, sky watching in the middle of the day. I thank my back problems for my experience. I am 32, married with two children. I am a social scientist by day, weather and astronomy enthusiast by night.  I have never seen any UFOs before, although I have spent far more time watching the sky than most people, for other reasons.

I went outside about 9:40 pm to water some grass areas of our lawn due to burning and dying areas of lawn near the house.  As I proceeded to water areas of the grass the needed help I could hear just a few local fireworks going off not to far away from my location.  Then after watering the grass areas for about 7 minutes approximately facing my north, northwest position I turned to northeast to hit and bad grass spot and noticed what appeared at first to be a red firework I thought approximately 3-5 miles away above the neighbors garage across the street.  So thinking that it was just a red firework that had exploded I noticed that it did not dissipate.  So I proceeded to keep watering but kept looking at this red light ..at that distance it just appeared to be round.  Then I focus back on it and noticed that it began to slowly move north to a northwest direction and slowly moved more northwest.  Then watching for a couple minutes this red object turned toward my direction and began coming toward my direction.  I thought oh I must just be a plane or jet heading this way. So after another minute it came close enough to notice that it did not have any flashing lights or appeared to seem like it was a plane or jet.  Then the object appeared to slowly move in a southwest direction still coming towards me.  After another minute passed I realized it sure was not any plane, helicopter, or any type of jet or even a drone.  This red object then slowed to complete stop approximately and guessing an altitude of about 10-12,000 feet above it was probably no more than 2 or 3 street blocks just to the north of me and I noticed the shape better colors better and had the shape of a cigar or rectangle sitting totally vertical straight up and down.  I noticed this craft had some white colors appearing to blend in with the red and the very top had sort of a T shape to it but small and was hovering in that position for well over a minute.  I knew right away ! the this was some sort of UFO and it did not make any sound or! sounds whatsoever.  At the time there was a couple fireworks that rose just over the tree tops as I was facing north while watching this object hover at about an 75-80 degree position just above me.  The fireworks down the street then stopped and I figured those people might be seeing this same cigar shaped object.  Not sure why the fireworks stopped but then I noticed this craft began to slowly start moving towards the west and began to rise a bit higher while still moving 45 degrees upward towards the west. I then glanced back at where I first saw it and took maybe 5 steps back away and noticed the same exact red ball in the same exact location I saw this one. Almost seemed like this object was waiting for this other craft.  Turned my attention back to the one closest to me and noticed to was rising up much higher at 45 degrees and eventually went thru a very high light cloud bank and noticed the red color thru to white and then fade as it rose attitude much much higher then disappear almost like watching clouds start to cover a star at night. So I kept looking for it but it completely disappeared.  After that I turned back to watch the second UFO and it basically took the same path as the first did but didn’t stop over my head.  That object was identical to the first.. same colors, same shape and size.  It also proceeded to rise up at the same 45 degree angle and follow the first one until both completely disappeared just towards the south area of where the Big Dipper was.  I looked around to see if anything else would appear and just noticed the clear moon with I believe a planet and star I’m guessing near it. Was I fairly clear evening with moonlight visible and I don’t recall seeing and type of glow from these objects reflecting off the ground. I contacted the two nearest police departments the very next day knowing they probably would be busy due to the 4th of July. I can tell you that I was semi skeptical about UFOs my whole life..well up until the l! ast evening and now I am a believer 1000%. These two objects I! saw wer e definitely not from this planet. I tried to take a video with my cell phone and it turned out bad. Tried zooming to focus but some reason video ended up 16 seconds long w a white blip (the UFO) and you could hear the last 2 fireworks go off and then completely stop well before both craft had completely disappearing, I am bit upset that I did not snap photos but tried to video the first object while tossing the garden hose on the ground without me getting wet. I thought i had good video footage so I never attempted to try to shoot some photos of both objects.",2020-07-31T00:00:00,38.4782,-75.1981

This report is written by the husband of the observer.  I am writing this with her knowledge and given permission to distribute it to interested parties.  Her name may not be used or given unless requested in person. On or about June 17, 2020, I saw a triangular-shaped object to the front of my car and slightly off to my left.  My car was heading in a southerly direction.  The time was about 2000hrs. I was just returning from fishing at my brother's pond. As I cleared a grove of woods and entered an area with fields on all sides, I saw a large solid triangular object moving very slowly in my direction.  I slowed my car to a stop and rolled down my driver's side window.  The flowing best describes what I saw:  The object was triangular, grey-white in colour.  From point to point it appeared to be about 120 feet long, moving at a speed of only several yards per minute.  It’s height above me and toward my left was roughly 200 feet above the ground.  It made no sound.  I noticed it had a light on each tip of the triangle, when it momentarily flashed blue and did so again about five minutes later.  It continued in the same general northerly direction until I stopped observing it approximately 15 minutes later. My wife also said during this time she saw a smaller object, a lot higher in altitude approaching the UFO from the opposite direction and then slowly circle around behind it and maintaining the approximate speed of the UFO.  Yet she feels this was more of a traditional craft that seemed to be observing the UFO. Some additional information she mentioned in our conversation:  She did not leave the car. The sky was totally clear, except for the object.  The Wind was calm and never changed. There were no sounds coming from anything in nature.  No reaction from nearby domestic herd animals.  No changes in the car or electronics.  She never thought of taking a picture with her cell phone, and does not understand why.

One came close to a bird feeder pole and slightly banked, then re-positioned as they continued flying. I have no clue what this and other recorded events like it were that followed for a few days after (July 21, 22, and 26).

Littleton, CO 80128 At approximately 10:02pm on Monday, July 21st, 2020, I was reminded by the local news to take a look outside as the Neowise comet may be visible. I didn’t see the comet, but knowing that the ISS was also supposed to be visible from my location around that time. I immediately spotted a slowly blinking light moving from west to east. Its direction suddenly changed to the south and slowly made it towards my community. As it got closer, I noticed to trailing lights that were just a bit dimmer. Looking closely, it was obvious this was a triangular arrangement of lights that were now hovering over my townhome complex and making no sound. On a couple of separate occasions, the “trailing” lights got slightly brighter which allowed for more illumination of the overall craft; it was indeed triangular. It was then that I noticed other moving lights in the area. Some with a faint red glow and others that appeared to be smaller versions of this particular craft. At one point one of the smaller crafts flew under the larger, original triangle and completely illuminated the underside of this object. The shadowing that the smaller craft cast provided a brief glimpse of texture to the underside of the larger craft. Think 4 very distinct “ribs;” like you’d see on a leather car seat. The object would also occasionally shift as if to redirect its course while not actually going anywhere. Originally, the brightest light was facing south, but after about 30 minutes of observation, it was apparent it was now facing west. At this point I asked my daughter to come outside and tell me what she thought she was looking at. At first she said some planes, but I had to remind her that planes don’t hover; and they are not generally silent. She then said, “Dad, what’s that,” and point in the direction of northeast sky. It appeared that there was a larger version of the original triangular-shaped object just a few miles to north of us. This one had all of its lights illuminated so that any observer could make out its outline – triangular but twice as large and with what may have been a tail, like a stingray. It then emitted a streak of white light to the northwest that left the atmosphere within a split second. This was the first of three instances that I saw streaking white lights heading in that direction. I could not verify any other sources however. Then the drones started flying. This was clearly a man-made object that flew from the north just along the top of some trees, took position just south of the object and flew up to an elevation of about 300 feet. It stayed right there for at least 3 hours. By 1:30am on Tuesday, there were at least 5 drones surrounding the object(s). I Invited some friends over to have a look and also met my neighbor in the parking lot; they all confirmed exactly was I have described. In fact, once they went home, they could actually track that at least two small triangles had migrated slowly to the west. The drones moved accordingly. At this point I was too tired to stay up and just accepted that there are things out there that I may never understand.",2020-08-06T00:00:00,39.56792218259629,-105.0102302425107

It was pitch dark but our eyes had adjusted to the night and we could see almost everything, including the stars and Milky Way formation.  We were setting outside watching stars and talking.  We had been outside for several hours.  We were looking over a large clearing in the valley of two large mountains when all at once we both witnessed a orb of light come over the mountains and drop into the valley about a mile away-directly in front of us.  Within a second, it flashed directly in front of us about thirty yards away.  Within another second or two it passed our position before turning back to us . It hesitated directly in front of us again about twenty yards away before zipping directly opposite our position and back over the mountain.  The event lasted about 6-8 seconds and it was over.  It reminded me of watch fire flies in the back yard.  Only these orbs were larger and coveri! ng large distances between flashes.  They were about the size of a golf ball . They would flash in one spot and then flash again within a second somewhere else Covering large areas at a time. You could see a slight tail of light behind it giving the eye a sense of direction when it flashed as it was traveling.  Other than the slight tail, it was basically a flash of light in the shape of a round ball.  The color was about the same color as the stars; a light blueish-white color.  We were both surprised and amazed at what just happened in front of our eyes. The size is somewhat confusing because it is hard to place its size to scale.  That’s because the country behind it was so big, and the distance it was coving was so large.  He is fourteen years old and I know it made a huge impact on his life..  At the time of the encounter, we  were having a conversation about the stars, life in outer space, and religion.

Multiple UFO sighting in Sioux City, IA.  My girlfriend and I counted approximately 15 satellite like objects flying one after another across the night sky on March 20, 2020.  Objects were flying in the same direction spaced apart in equal distances.  Only 2 or 3 were visible at a time.  They all appeared at the same point in the sky.  They also disappeared at the same point in the sky.  Each object was visible for about 20 second or so.  I would say they looked to be just seconds behind one another.  Objects were flying in the exact same path in the same direction.  Other commercial planes where flying by which gave a great comparison to how much higher in the sky the ufo objects were.  I have never seen anything like this. I have seen satellites that look similar but never so many one after another after another. 	&#9702;",2020-04-09T00:00:00,42.50055538461538,-96.37649128205128

A few minutes after arriving I spotted what I believed to be the comet.  It appeared as a white ball of light with a streaking tail. Just below & to the left of the big dipper.  We were facing northwest.  When I spotted it I told the children to get out of the car that I found the comet.  When my oldest child got out & spotted the object he said ""dad there's no way that's a comet.  Its moving too fast.""  I immediately realized he was exactly right.  In the matter of seconds it took for them to exit the vehicle the object had traveled from below to the left of the big dipper to far above and so far to the right of it, it wasn't even in the vicinity of the dipper anymore.  Believing at this point it must be an airplane. We continued to track it through the sky.  It very quickly descended to far below the big dipper to! the right and continued on that path.  While tracking it through the sky eyes fully on it, it instantly disappeared and within maybe 3 seconds reappeared slightly above and to the right of the big dipper. It sat motionless like a star for a matter of seconds. Having my camera ready for pictures of the comet, when it reappeared I took a picture while it was still. Then it dramatically took off to the right. I also took a picture of this. As I was looking through my camera I again lost sight of the object. I lowered my camera and searched the sky. I found the object again in a lower position far to the right of the big dipper. Perhaps in the northeast direction. With my camera zoomed as far as possible I was able to get one last picture. The object then dramatically moved in an upward direction to the left. Towards northern direction and disappeared from sight. The last picture I took, although the object appeared as a white ball of light to our eyes. The picture displayed something appearing triangular with a circular field of white light around it. 3 aircraft passed over head while we were at this location.

Second light seen that night. I may have seen two UFOs this evening over the southern Nevada desert. I live near to the Air Force Nevada Test and Training Range for decades, and am familiar with all types of military aircraft and drones. These observations did not match any aircraft I have observed flying around the area. The observations verged on natural phenomena so I was not alarmed, but these were unusual .  I work in the sciences and field biology, and am an active night sky astronomy fan for decades. I headed outside at early dusk just after sunset around 20:30 hours Pacific time, to check whether Comet NEOWISE was visible yet in the northwest sky, as I have doing all week. It was not yet visible. I have also been observing very bright Jupiter (magnitude -2.75) and Saturn rising in the lower sky to the southeast every evening.  As I walked out into our rural driveway in the Mojave Desert I looked up and saw a bright “planet” which I first thought was Jupiter, as it was a similar bright white light high in the sky. Although I was somewhat confused as this seemed off the ecliptic and much higher after sunset –almost overhead—than Jupiter has been. I admired it for several seconds in the darkening blue dusk sky, just before stars were becoming visible.  As I walked a few steps further around some trees I then noticed the real Jupiter and Saturn rising on the SE portion of the sky above the horizon, glowing as they have been during the past week. I became confused and placed my iPhone camera skywatch app onto this Jupiter, and it identified as Jupiter. I then looked back at what I had supposed was a very bright “Jupiter” and was even more confused to see it moving in a straight line heading due north in what appeared to be high in the sky. It was like a bright star or planet moving at an even speed like a jet aircraft, but with no blinking airplane lights. It appeared to be high in the sky like a jet airplane would be, but there was no sound and no appearance of sunlight reflecting off a high metal airplane. But I wondered if it was a strange military bomber heading to the Nevada Test and Training Range which has a boundary 10 miles to the east of my location.  The object was similar in appearance to Jupiter as it is visible this week, but very slightly brighter. It seemed to move somewhat faster than a typical jet, but slow enough I could see it move clearly and follow it with my eyes. It continued “flying” at an even speed to the north until it was blocked by trees and I lost it.  I was confused and thought it must be a strange military bomber jet, although it was stationary when I first observed it, like a bright planet first appearing in the dusk sky just after sunset. The white light was circular like Jupiter appears through binoculars. This happened before the stars and night sky appeared, and there was still some sunset “alpenglow” on the desert mountains. I have never seen anything like it, although it was not large or flashy.  Later that evening around 21:40 my husband and I watched Comet NEOWISE for a few hours into the night, dark Moon so excellent viewing and no city light pollution in the Death Valley region. We were sitting in the yard with binoculars admiring the comet. The night sky was now very dark and full of stars. A small white light then appeared in our view in the northwestern sky, low, and traveled in a slow straight line to the east. It traveled perfectly straight and at an even speed. My husband asked what was that? I put my binoculars on it and saw no flashing green or red airline lights as was typical. Just a white pinpoint of light. I said I did not know what that was. I wondered if it was a satellite, although it was not rotating and catching sunset light as satellites often do, nor was it traveling overhead across the night sky, but low on the northern horizon from west to east, again towards the Nevada Test and Training Range. We both thought it was unusual and wondered if i! t was a military aircraft. It passed under the view of the comet. My husband said it was traveling faster than a normal commercial airline, but it was slow enough that I could fix my binoculars on it and see the white point of light, no apparent shape and not appearing to be something reflecting high altitude sunlight—but more like it was producing its own light like a bight star. It passed out of view to the NE and we were left wondering what that seemingly distant traveling light object was. No sound, no contrail, no tail.",2020-07-23T00:00:00,,

Unfortunately, due to this awareness of my altered states of consciousness, a lot of people with whom I’ve talked with seem to dismiss my experiences as “drug psychosis”, however I believe if anyone were to interview me, my testament is so honest that unless what I experienced was in fact a drug psychosis, I can only attribute my experience to some sentient being making contact with me while I was in a psychologically “open” state of consciousness. 	On Thursday evening I was sitting in my bedroom watching episodes of a television show called “King of the Hill” with my partner.  I remember the specific episode was regarding Tarot cards and magical themes, which is relevant to some other “supernatural” phenomena that I’ve been experiencing.  During a particular scene where the characters were invoking a “magical ritual”, I felt the air around me shift, and I knew that what I was experiencing was only for me and not my partner (he did not experience the phenomena, but can attest to my urgent and focused behavior).  When I say the “air shifted”, what I really mean is that I believe, through the television’s waves, gravity was being manipulated, and I was being called upon by something that made me feel overwhelmingly compelled to follow it. 	From the television, I can plainly see a tube-like faint glimmer providing the “map” in which I was following.  It looked slightly pale yellow and translucent.  I ran out of the house with no shoes, cellphone, keys, ID, or anything but the clothes on my body. I left the doors agape and left in such a frenzy that my partner tried to chase me, but ultimately didn’t follow me beyond the end of our street.  In that moment, I was so compelled to instinctively follow this feeling in my stomach that knew there was something to behold on the other end.  As I’m speed-walking through the neighborhood into the woods nearby, I hear lots of dogs barking in a fright for a few moments, only to all suddenly go silent, which I thought was unusual. As I’m following the “tube” I was in a trance like state.  I thought it was divine, to be honest, until I felt the gravity tube go from pulling me forward to pulling upwards.  I looked up to see a LARGE craft that made a very faint noise which sounds similar to when an airplane is heating up the engines before takeoff.  It appeared to be traveling at a fast, but not overwhelmingly so cruising speed.  The craft was a circular, flat disc which I could only see from the bottom from my vantage point, but it had (I believe) either nothing on it whatsoever, or faint lights surrounding the outer perimeter of the craft; though I believe it was the latter, I cannot be certain.  The craft also moved through the air as if it was frictionless, which is physically impossible (to my knowledge) unless it is able to operate in either a state of superposition, or if it could manipulate gravity itself. 	I tried to get the crafts attention by waving, but I did not make a sound. I was speechless, but to be quite honest, not surprised. Unfortunately, the craft flew past me and I was left following the direction the tube shifted to, but it grew faint when I got to a parking lot which was empty except for two vehicles.  The tube led me directly to one specific vehicle; I approached a man whose face was illuminated by a light and attempted to inquire if he was experiencing anything strange, however I quickly saw that the man was masturbating to something on his cellphone, so I walked away startled, but did indeed call out to him from afar asking him if something weird was going on.  Obviously, the man said yes, but If it were not for the tube that led me directly to approach him, specifically his cellphone, I would have felt less convinced that this is something that uses satellite technology or cell phones to communicate. I believe these beings may be using technology to manipula! te gravity remotely.  Unfortunately, I was not able to follow on foot for much longer, as the tube of light led me to Worcester Technical School where I lost the trail. I walked all around the premises trying to get in to no avail. There is, without a doubt, video surveillance of me in the school’s possession which can hopefully provide a more accurate timestamp of when this occured, as it was only within 10-30 minutes after the sighting that I arrived at the school.",2020-08-20T00:00:00,42.26863925549915,-71.80715499153976

My sister and I were on deck of beach house looking south and out over the gulf, at I guess a 30 to 40 degree angle, we saw an orangey red light (appeared larger than Jupiter that was visible that night) in the sky. It was not moving. A second light seemed to move out from the first and they both were stationary for a moment and then disappeared.  I few seconds later, another orangey red light of the same size appeared then after a moment disappeared.  After a couple of seconds another red light appeared and as in the first instance, a second light seemed to move out from the first and both were stationary and then they disappeared. Although the lights were stationary when they appeared, the location of each event seemed to very slightly more eastward.  Although not certain, it seems that the appearance of the second single light was slightly lower than the two events involving 2 lights. After the sighting, we called other people out on to the deck in hopes that they would see it too. There were approximately 15 of us. No more red lights appeared but at about 10:30 pm, to the west above the shoreline, a consecutive burst of lights appeared, seemed like 5 total, then disappeared. It was quick and those who saw it were left with different impressions. Some thought the lights looked almost square, other though round and some though maybe just cloudy puffs of something. However, one of us got a photo with a phone although it is fuzzy, the photo definitely shows it was lights, not anything cloudy or flame-like. I am aware that there is an airport somewhere to the west of where we were located. Considering that, there may be a plausible explanation for the lights. However, the red light were definitely not the common red light you see on aircraft.

I'm in a urban area with a lot of light pollution and the comet is faint so I never had any success. At 10PM EST I went out again. By this time it was fully dark and there were large white puffy clouds moving swiftly from WNW but the space between the clouds was * crystal clear * and I could easily see stationary stars. Suddenly I noticed a fast moving ""star"" traveling from WSW coming from behind clouds.  It was white and as bright as Venus.  At first I thought it might be the International Space Station as it was moving at a constant speed high behind the clouds but since it was moving slower I discounted it as the ISS. I watched it travel in a straight line moving from WSW to North at a constant speed disappearing and reappearing between breaks in the clouds. When it passed the Big Dipper, two more bright white moving ""stars"" came into view between the clouds. One heading WNW and one heading West. They were dimmer than the first moving ""star"" and moving at about the same rate of speed but slower (I assume because they were farther away). Unfortunately the white puffy clouds were increasing so the moving ""stars"" were difficult to track as they disappeared behind the fast moving puffy-white clouds. As the clouds were increasing I began to look for spaces between clouds and I looked almost directly up and saw another very bright moving ""star"" heading WSW. It was white and as bright as the first moving ""star"" but the clouds were increasing and it disappeared behind the clouds .  I eventually lost track of the first moving ""star"" behind the ever increasing cloud-cover as it traveled North.  The moving ""stars"" weren't an illusion caused by the moving clouds.  I could clearly see fixed, stationary stars and the moving ""stars"".  The entire incident lasted less than 5 minutes. I'm about 5 miles from an airport to the North and during this same period of time I could see two low flying planes approaching the airport in front of the clouds (lower than the clouds). The moving white ""stars"" were not planes. The planes were easy to identify because they have red, green, and white blinking landing lights and moved like planes I see all the time.   I also had another incident on the last Saturday of May.  It was 10PM EST and I went out to toss some trash. It was a clear night.  Whenever I go outside at night I always take a moment to look at the night sky; seeing which constellations are visible. As I said, I live in an urban area with lots of light pollution and there are houses and trees that block my view so I'm limited by what I can see; usually only the Big Dipper and Orion depending on the time of year. On a good clear night if I look out a second floor window I can see the Pleiades. Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn are easy to locate.  As I turned to the house to go inside, I was standing in the driveway looking SE. About 45-50 degrees above the horizon I saw a redish-orange ""star"". At first I thought it might be Mars which is fairly common and easy to see. However it just didn't look exactly like Mars. My next thought was it might be a candle sky lantern someone released so I stood still to see if it would drift. It didn't. It was stationary.  Then, without notice, this redish-orange ""star"" shot directly away from me and in less than a second disappeared.  After these two sighting I have gone outside when the night sky is clear but I haven't seen anything since.  Best regards",2020-09-04T00:00:00,42.902226093175315,-78.85083919084595

It made zero sense as I was miles from the nearest ATV road and the moon was in a different direction.   One evening I woke up to an extremely bright light shining into my tent.  It is abnormal to see anyone in back country that time of year, but occasionally I come across bow hunters.  I began speaking that I was in tent, it was not vacant.  (I've had people mistake me for a friend they were trying to catch up with as well).  But no one answered.  The light stayed there, lighting up the entirety of the interior.  After a couple minutes I was fully awake.  I thought maybe it was the moon, but them remembered I had seen the moon earlier before going to bed.  The moon was not that bright and in a different area of the night sky.  Confused I continued to speak to what could only be a bright flash light coming through the fabric.  I explained there were ""other great tent sites with flat/cleared ground just up the trail.  After a few attempts with no answer I decided to go out.  The light was too bright to ignore. When I walked out of the tent, all the ground was illuminated with bright white light.  There was no sound, none at all.  In front of me, maybe 30 yards and 30 yards up was a very bright light.  No shape to it.  The light was brighter in the center and faded out as it hit the ground.  I am an intelligent and well educated, but I did not know what I was looking at.  I still cannot properly explain it.  The light was well above the few trees and was silhouetting the trees in front of me between myself and it.  I stared, just curious.  There are no roads near me for miles.  The moon is to my left and fairly high in the sky by this point.  It lit the clouds and silhouetted the mountains across the saddle.  The light was slightly to my left.  It lit everything around me. I have little fear and walked towards it slowly.  I was very confused.  I didnt ask any questions, not even to myself other than, ""what the heck"".  I got closer and only see light with darkness behind it.  No real form or shape, just light.  After several minutes with no noise, it moved back away from me and to the left.  It went very very slowly over maybe 1,500ft of a saddle.  The light became dimmer and dimmer as it moved but still visible.  After maybe two minutes it resembled a dim flash light. Then 1 second later it was out.  I was left looking at the silhouetted mountain and was fully back in my typical mountain darkness. I stared and listen for a several minutes longer.  I was completely perplexed.  I originally walked out of my tent expecting to see a person or two with very bright headlamps, maybe back country rangers.  But I saw nothing but this hugely bright light coming from above the few trees there.  I had picked the campsite because of the beautiful view yards from the ridge where I could see the valley of Apens changing..  I still have a photo of my view from earlier that afternoon looking out from inside my tent.  This completely perplexed me. With very little moon light I made it to my tent and decided I wouldnt tell anyone.  What was there to tell?  There was zero sense.  I told my wife when I got down eventually.  I think it was an after thought over dinner and wine one night.  Now after her asking about it again, the memory came right back.

On the night of August 20th, 2020 my girlfriend and I were leaving my house to her apartment around 9:15 or so.  As we left my house, which is on top of a hill, I noticed a long string of lights flashing in odd patterns sitting in the sky.  As we noticed it, we stopped my car on top of the hill and watched it.  It continually changed the pattern in which it flashed its light, it almost looked as if it was communicating in morse code or something like that. Eventually, the object slowly lowered and disappeared.  We did not see it again.  We kept driving to see if we could find it again but it was gone…  However, as we did keep driving my girlfriend noticed two more solid colored bright lights sitting in the air.  They sat near each other motionless except for slight rotation.  Slowly one drifted away from the other toward the right and we could make out a box looking shape with two flashing lights on opposing corners and two solid lights on the other two.  This object! made no noise and disappeared behind a building.  Simultaneously, the other object remained perfectly still in its original location until it seemed to slowly rise and start hovering ever so slowly toward us.  We watched it come closer and take the form of a disc with two large lights in the middle and two smaller lights on the edges.  It continued to approach us noiseless until it came right over our heads.  At this point, I could see it was no longer a disc but a boomerang shape with one light in the center and another two lights, one on each point.  It made no noise at all.  As it hovered over me, still noiseless, it maintained its boomerang shape and then suddenly I saw a tail and it was a plane.  The essence of it was eerie almost like it changed its shape upon approachment.  My take on this scenario is that either this was a plane and it was after the original UFO, it was a UFO with shape shifting capabilities, or the US government has antigravity technology as this object/p! lane hovered over one spot for over 10 minutes before hovering! slowly and noiselessly.",2020-08-27T00:00:00,29.488865917141535,-98.4752404435546

Best example i can give is If you held a full lenth #2 pencil up in the air with your arms stretched out and pencil held by fingers, showing from left to right, the length of the pencil, thats the width from left to right on the V shaped object or close to it. Using that, that should give an idea of height as well.  It was moving pretty fast. Saw maybe 3 to 4 seconds of it.  Pretty amazing actually.

We also have NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) out here, so I've seen weather balloons before, as well. As I drove closer into town, down the mountain, I noticed they weren't descending, which was odd. As I almost got down into town, 2 fighter jets flew by, that's when I decided to pull over and film. Again, I know we have a large Air Force base in Colorado Springs, so not super unusual to see some fighter jets, but quite interesting I saw them during this moment. The objects were silent and hovering together, also too large to be drones. I wish I had a way of demonstrating size, but they were in the distance and definitely too large for drones. I watched for as long as I could, I had to get to an appointment, but I lost sight of them after driving into Lafayette, about 5 miles from Boulder. I drove up to another high spot and couldn't find them anywhere in the sky. Watched the news hoping someone else might have recorded or seen these objects, but I haven't found any info.

There were super clear skies and the sun had just set. As we walked we watched the sky change colors from the sunset and I noticed a bright white star which I guessed was a planet.  As we kept walking I noticed an even larger light in the sky which at first glance looked like Mars.  It was bigger than the other planet we saw and was bright orange and red.  I thought it odd because its size was much bigger than usual.  Maybe twice as big as Saturn in the night sky.  I mentioned it to my girlfriend and we were both curious about what it could be.  We talked about it a bit and both thought it was odd.  So I set my bags down and got out my phone and opened the Star Walk App.  I lifted it up to see what the object could be and the object was gone.  I then pointed the Star Walk App at the other planet we saw and that was Saturn.  Then went back to the area in the sky whe! re the Orange ball had been.

THEY DO NOT APPEAR OR BEHAVE AS PLANETS The below refers in part to materials I was not able to include because of your file limits. I can send you the materials discussed but not included via Google or We Transfer. Hello - My name is ((namea dleted)). I am a music teacher and photographer who lives on the West Side of Santa Cruz, California. I am writing to ask for your help in interpreting one of the strangest things I have ever seen. It has been occurring since late October and continues each night there are no clouds or rain. On October 29th my neighbors and I first noticed two unidentifiable lights in our neighborhood - one smaller and distant, the other large and seemingly closer. I am a layman and not a scientist, but I feel like I can rule out a planet because: - they don't move position in the sky from night to night, or even week to week.They appear to return to the same coordinates each night; Both the smaller light and the large and bright one move in the sky visible to the naked eye. The smaller lights’ movement is very jagged. The brighter objects’ movement is more of a swaying back and forth. When I center the brighter object with my camera on a tripod, it moves out of frame in minutes, to the point where it is no longer visible from my vantage point. After several repositionings of the tripod, I have always had to move to a new location to continue shooting it. The brighter object has many smaller, fainter, fast moving lights near and around it that are very visible in the screen of my camera when it is in live view. The brighter object is usually accompanied by a triangular looking object that moves from frame to frame around and near it, photos 5347-5357. There is some wind, but the tripod is fixed, and to my layman’s eye it appears to show both objects moving in contrary motion to one another. I have also been videotaping the object since October 30th with my cell phone. I am enclosing a few videos and some freeze frames. In movie 1423, I was actually able to film the brighter object arriving in daylight. In movie “Video 2,” taken on 11/13/21, watch for a series of flashes, about 25 in all, starting in the upper right moving left, above and around the bright object. I did freeze frames of these flashes, which are enclosed. In movie 1579, taken November 23rd at 5:48, to the lower left of the bright object is a smaller flashing light, which when zoomed in on looks very curious, almost like a metallic, spinning hexagram. Beginning on November 10th, I started using my Nikon D750 on a tripod (although I had to move the tripod several times when the lights were moving quickly.) After observing and photographing the larger object with my 500mm lens, it seems like there is a pattern to what is occurring on a nightly basis. I want to say again that I am a layman, and so the terms and descriptions I use may not be scientific or accurate, but they describe what a layman has seen and photographed on several nights. The object arrives as a sphere (Movie 1423, taken November 6th at 6:27pm). It seems to grow in size and brightness and then goes through a series of intense flashes, lasting several seconds, where the intensity of the light increases, and the sphere appears to change shape. In the photos where the sphere is not a sphere any longer, for lack of any other way to describe it, multi-colored, worm-like objects that to my layman’s eye resemble DNA strands fill the entire sky. To my unscientific eye they appear to be clones of the object in some way, because these “DNA strands” are the exact shape of the nearby object as it flashes with different shapes in each of these photos. I have taken photos of this on a few different nights. Photos 4812-4912 are from 11/10/21 at 7:55pm. Photos 5615, 5677, and 5691 were taken on 11/17 at 8:30pm and show very similar images to 11/10. 5691 shows a stick like object that appears in many other photos. The last series of photos from 11/24/21 are for me the most puzzling and the most disturbing. I can only describe it in my very unscientific terms. During this stage the object moves a lot, and so I was struggling to keep up with it. They show the main, bright object being surrounded by multi-colored projectiles of some sort. I struggled to get the first shots of this, photos 5364-5378, which are partially obscured by the trees. (One interesting thing to note is the way the triangular object is visible even through the tree in photo 5364). In photo sequence 5379-5385, I got a clear shot of this head on. The projectiles surround the bright object and seemingly penetrate it like sperm to an ovum for lack of a better metaphor, exploding out the other side of the object with a great flash of energy. On November 17th I captured the same images a third time just before the object moved and went out of range, photos 5781-5794. I have many more images that I can send that span several weeks if you are interested. I am simply looking for a scientific, rational explanation for what I have filmed and photographed. Thank you so much for your help!",2021-12-19T00:00:00,37.011256646216765,-122.04450858895706

It moved up into the sky, moving southwest to northeast in a trajectory between the cross and whatever planet was bright and about 30° above the horizon at the time.  It wasn't as bright as the planet and had a similar appearance to a satellite in the atmosphere.  It caught our attention because it moved much faster than a satellite or an airplane, was either far to small or high to be an airplane, and it made no noise.  When we lost site of the first light, qe noticed another emerging on the horizon from the same place, on the same path.  When we lost site or the second, a third appeared.  Came up from the same place, on the same path.

My elevation 500' multiple objects passing in front of the moon at that time but in and out of the clouds , very close together and approx. 10 degrees to the West and traversing from the north. Facing north the objects would be at the 10 o'clock high altitude position at the moons proximity. Objects looked like a string of black beads without sound no light no aura no uniform shape but daisy looking folding and changing shape all moving up and down then all vanished instantly appearing to rollup and disappear. Their were at least four jet aircraft in the vicinity,two very large white jet liners without windows navigating due east one very high about 20,000 ' the other close at about 5,000' . At least two fighter jets headed southwest at &lt;  10,000'. Just before the black objects were seen the sky was being painted with chemicals by at least four other aircraft . I took some photos from phone but nothing showed up.This sighting is true and accurate to the best of my ability. But the objects were so fast that they were gone all in about the blink of the eye. I don't hardly believe that this is worth reporting but I'm positively sure that at least several military aircraft know everything , military might talk to you for confirmation but you won't get the truth ! from them and that is a fact . Never report anything to the military . My brother worked at Papoose and area 51 installing navigation equipment in underground antigravity craft from 1994 and in 1996 they said he died .My brother would come home for Christmas and draw us pictures and diagrams of the craft ,  facilities and nasty military police that were ordered to shoot him if he stepped outside of the hallways. He worked on a particular disc that was silver without seams or external gear but a ramp to inter the ship once inside of the saucer you can see in every direction like inside a fish bowl . Solid metallic exterior but completely transparent while inside . ( All of the seats and accommodations were very small , like for a five-year old children's furniture size ). Saucer floating but could not be tipped. Several of these disc were reported from eight foot to eighty feet in diameter . I remember too that they would change color like carnival glass. Their were no contr! ols or buttons but graphics would appear and fade-out. Their w! ere hier oglyphics copied. We never got closure for my brothers supposed demise but my mother said that she has gotten phone calls from him on his birthday 01/22/56 for several years then nothing . Really don't think my recent sighting is worth reporting but maybe someday I'll be able to get some pictures to make things worthwhile for you . I don't really know why you want folks to report their sightings because we all see them and we know extraterrestrials are everywhere that there is no secret only the gov. military industrial complex evilness and ugliness. If you are part of the cover up and I expect you are then you are culpable for many crimes against humanity and you too must be indicted .

When seen through my telescope (wewere looking at the comet and the planets),it had this strange light and dark light,pattern or field around and above it, likelight defraction patterns. No other starswere as low or had that effect. I could notsee colors with telescope. Only by naked eyeobservations. I was visting a friend and she and I werelooking at the comet on Easter night andshe said hey, look at that satellite! I wasfacing north and I focused my Meade telescopeon it. It was flashing orange and green in arotating fashion...I then looked at itthrough my scope and to my surprise I couldntdetect the colors!Instead it had this really weird lightfield...of dark and bright lines above andaround it...like a light defraction pattern.The object was really bright white with thosestrange lines going around it in a strangestriped pattern. The colors could not bedetected with the scope! I then thought itwas my lens so I focused on a bright star andthe patterns were not present on anything else!When I looked again with just my eyes I sawthe flashing rotating orange and green lightsbut when I used the scope, all I saw was thestrange dark and light patterns. It was lowin the sky, and stationary. I was facingnorth and it was to my right. I looked at itoff and on for about 2 hrs. while checkingout the comet and mars.I went home, I live a block away, and when Igot to my house and looked up again to find it,it was not there--to my right! I was stillfacing north. I looked to my left and thereit was! It was so close(low)that a one blockdrive was enough to move it over. So it meansit was positioned in between my friends houseand mine! I dont think high altitudegeosynchronistic satellites would be lowenough to cause that much of a difference ifI moved only a block away! Plus later, after2 days of clouds, it was no where to be seen!Ive never seen anything out of the ordinarybefore. I know what venus and mars and theother planets look like through my scope, soI'm sure it wasnt a planet!My friend saw the colored lights, cause shepointed it out to me, but she went intoher house while I stayed outside and lookedat the sky and the ""object"". It was too coldfor her!

It very clearly hovered beyond the display over the water and dramatically moved up/down/left/right in a way very similar to how a drone would move, however the light on it was constant and drones are NOT this large. I wasn't sure where to report this and only just thought about actually reporting it so I'm sorry it's so late.  I'm guessing you can find a recording of the event and it was very clear there was something there. The UFO floated most of the time, moving left/right and based on the size within the stream/image I would estimate it was at least 20ft across.  The light was continuously on and there was a slight blur when it moved, it also seemed to move in a way I've not experienced drones being capable of.  I fly drones and that area is a 'no drone' area and I'm convinced it was not just a drone, it was far too large.  Unfortunately the only recording I can find is an angle from the airport, the Roche Harbor resort live streamed it from the resort/dock perspective.  Whatever it is, it was behind the fireworks by a large distance so you won't see it in the airport video. I should have filmed it but hopefully you can find something.

My son said “ look ” ,  what he thought was a formation of birds approaching was actually a dull glowing triangle composed of three spheres that flew directly across our field of view.   The craft’s  design  had two spheres  on the bottom and one on the top.  They  were even spaced a few feet apart with no connecting structure being visible. This craft was traveling swift and silently on a straight line course from SE to NW .  Flight was steady and without any rotation or spin.  This craft was in flight at an altitude that I estimate to be 200 to 300 feet,  thus  placing this craft relatively closer than many other sightings.  The spheres each had a very faint internal illumination resembling the dull matte glow of a paper lantern.  At first I thought this was moonshine on the craft as there was a first quarter moon that had risen early to our backs and behind us , however, my son verified witnessing  this internal light source. As far as size.  I would estimate the craft to be no bigger than a full size pick up or van.  My son watched this approach and I watched it from the mid way point until it disappeared.  This was about 3 to 4 seconds of viewing time.   Estimating speed could be difficult ,  I would say that maybe take off speed of an Air Force jet.  I have a somewhat wide view of the sky and 3 to 4 seconds of passing flight time could be a close estimate.  We both watched this event happen and this was not a drone , balloons or aircraft of any type that I have ever seen.

I immediately nosticed a bright starlike light, not twinkling.  It was sitting still at first then it started moving.  It looked just like a satellite which I have watched many.  You suddenly it moved very uncharacteristicly, very quickly.  As I watched it became very erratic in its movements.  I asked my new friend to look at it.  He seemed very uninterested.  He said, “Oh, it’s just a satellite.”  I told him it could not be a normal satellite because of it’s erractic, sudden movements and it’s sudden changes of direction. He looked but still was disinterested. He said something lie, you don’t believe in that stuff do you?”  I told him that I do because of past experiences  but that I never had witnessed before. He said that he had to get home and he left. He asked would I like to ride along another 2-3 miles to my car. He had to continue a few miles further. I said no, I’d like to watch this light another10-15 minutes, which I did. Though it moved most of the time it seems to remain i a small area of the sky.

The light was just below 11 o’clock high to the East-Southeast. Due to its position few people would be looking unless on purpose.

The tide was extremely far out, so we walked very far out and were enjoying the sand, the waves, and stars. Around 3:00 or 3:30AM, my boyfriend noticed a craft with lights come from behind him, heading west from the east, and then hovered infront of us, along the shoreline, above the ocean. He asked me what those lights were, and I noticed some lights, but waved it off as being a plane headed to LAX. He insisted that I look harder, because he believed the craft to be much closer than a plane would be, and he insisted that it was lingering infront of us. I squinted and really focused on the lights that I was seeing, and was shocked to realize that there was in fact something floating above the water's edge, above us, and it was much too close to be an airplane, and much too large to be some kind of drone. I could see two round, peach colored lights, almost a creamy light-red color, sitting right next to each other, and then somewhere close behind them, there was a white light that was flashing very, very slowly. It was hard to see a complete definition of the craft, but I could see that the oval outline of it, and area surrounding the lights, was a darker shade than the night sky around it. My boyfriend said that it was a helicopter, and I was skeptical, but as I focused in on the craft, it seemed to be hovering above the coast line as the police helicopters do during the day. We slowly came to the startling conclusion that it was a police helicopter, and began backing up, meanwhile never taking our eyes off of the craft. I ! was about to call for my two friends, who were slightly infront of us, slightly west, and then I suddenly realized that there was no sound. There was no sound of helicopter blades. I said that to my boyfriend, immediately as I thought it, and shock hit him, his mouth dropped, and he looked scared. We realized that one of our friends infront of us, was looking at the craft, and pointing. I called to her and asked if she saw it too. She said she did but had no idea what it was, and was trying to figure out if her eyes were playing tricks on her. She couldn't understand why the lights looked like they were so close. She asked me if I thought it was a satellite, and I pointed out that it was hovering right above us, and slightly infront of us, and she said, ""oh, is it a helicopter?"" and I repeated to her, that there was no sound. She had the same reaction as my boyfriend, that realization that there was no sound, made her mouth drop, and she looked shocked and scared. Our other friend, who was standing with the girl I was speaking with, was focusing on us talking, and then once she realized what was going on, she started wildly looking around, in the wrong direction, but me, my boyfriend, and my friend who saw the lights, looked right back at it. It seemed to be! slowly heading south, along the coast line, and at this point, the lights made it look like it was some sort of a triangular shape. I looked away, and made eye contact with my boyfriend, and when we looked back, the lights were completely gone. This was a very clear night, and there was not any fog or cloud covering. The lights just vanished, and they had previously been right there, slowly heading south. Two bright, creamy light-red lights, and a blinking white light just vanished into the clear sky. None of it made sense. The fourth girl that was down in the water with us, did not see the lights of the craft. We then realized that this girl's sister, the fifth member of our party, was still alone, higher up on the beach, where the sand was dry, and as we walked over to her, she was walking towards us. She immediately asked us if we saw the lights too. A chill went down my spine. She said that it came from behind us, from the east, just like what my boyfriend saw, and she said that it was a triangular shape, and when it flew above us, it had green lights lining the sides of the dark, triangular shaped craft. Once it was ahead of us, above the water, there were fewer lights, and the colors changed. She watched as it hovered above us, and came down slightly, and then slowly left, before disappearing. My boyfriend agreed that the craft looked like it was about to land. I saw it hovering infront of us, slowly going south, and then hovering north slightly, before going south very slowly again, hove! ring in place, and then leaving south, before disappearing. The girl who was down in the ocean with my boyfriend and I, she agreed that it looked triangular in shape, but that it looked oval at first to her too. We did not have our phones out when this occurred, but I did draw a picture of exactly what I saw immediately when I returned home. I will send it in an email. I began looking into what I saw, and I quickly realized that UFO spotting in Malibu, and the surrounding area, is extremely common. For this reason, I felt it was important to share my story. This was my first encounter with anything like this. Let me know if you have questions, but I feel as though I have been extremely detailed here.",2020-08-06T00:00:00,34.06816860465116,-118.8163988372093

No blinking lights to indicate aircraft. It was not a meteor or comit there was no tail/debris trail. The first one flew in our line of sight for approx. 30 sec before shrinking to a tiny speck in the night sky (on the same horizontal plane as it appeared.). As the first one vanished, two more appeared flying in the exact same trajectory as the one previous. Same speed, same altitude.  One about a thumbs length in front of the other (if holding thumb out sidewa! ys up to the sky). Those two repeated the same as the first, passing before us in a perfectly horizontal line as they diminished to specks as quickly as they had appeared. Best way I can describe it read as though they materialised/dematerialized by illuminating/extinguishing. They appeared to head in the direction of the city but never descending - 2 more appeared. Same path, same distance apart same everything. Then two more and same thing. It appeared as though once they got closer to the city the went from solid orbs of light to specks instantaneously. Was able to see them through binoculars but couldnt identify anything more then orange/red glowing orbs. We were left dumbfounded by what we saw.

My sister and I were looking at the night sky for those two hours by lying on our backs on chaise lounges on the outdoor patio (completely unenclosed) and looking up into an almost completely clear sky.  There was an extremely bright half moon behind us, that eventually moved away from us to the West behind the house so that it was no longer shining behind us. We were looking in the direction of the constellation Lyra, in order to see if we could see any meteors from the Delta Aquariid meteor shower.  We were both concentrating hard, and not moving around.  We had very good unimpeded visibility of the night sky from our left at the back of the house from the constellation Big Dipper in the West (our view when turning our heads to the left while lying supine almost completely flat), and to the East turning our heads to the right almost to the horizon, which is impeded by a tree line about 9 feet tall and about 9 yards to our right.  We had unimpeded views of the sky to the North at about the same height tree line but much farther away from us at a distance of approximately 30 yards, so that we had very good visibility of Lyra and a relative view to the ground from the bottom of the last visible stars Earthward under Lyra that would have appeared to us as approximately 5 feet above the horizon.  We weren’t looking at the Southern sk! y, but would not have had visibility behind us for 10 feet above the horizon due to houses and a distant tree line impeding our view below that height.  We were not observing that part of the sky (South) in any case. At approximately 1:00 AM on July 30, 2020, we both saw a bright flashing white light moving from our West (latitude above the Big Dipper, but below Lyra) to the East in a straight line to the East until it disappeared (or stopped flashing) as far to the East as I could see.  I believe the total travel time from West to East was approximately 30 seconds. Our surroundings were silent.  The light made no sound.  It did not curve or bend, except to follow the natural curve of the Earth.  It flashed a variably changing white light from very bright to extremely bright about every 5 seconds as it moved across the sky.  Nothing was in its way.  There were no airplanes near it or around it. The white flash was so bright, and so big at one point when it was almost to the furthest East on its path, that it looked like a giant white star-like shaped photo flash bulb firing down from 30,000 feet up in the sky. If I were standing up and holding a brand new pencil straight up and down by the pointed end in front of me with my right arm extended all the way out and the eraser up where the light was at its brightest, the light would have looked approximately the same size as that new, unused eraser looked with my arm extended and angled up.  At that point, the light, which otherwise appeared mostly round, appeared starfish shaped when it flashed its brightest flash, which occurred only once.  Otherwise, it was various sizes, but always larger than the visible stars/planets (per the Internet, 5 planets were visible that night) and always round.  The only thing that was larger in the sky that night was the moon. The light was very high the whole time, and I believe it was traveling at the very highest height that an airplane could travel, around 30,000 feet.  It did not look at all like an airplane.  Neither did it look at all like a natural phenomenon.  It looked like an extremely white artificially created light.  The pulsing of the light seemed intentionally regular, not sporadic, but not at all like any airplane light that I’ve ever seen.  It was much too bright, and much too big.  It was also solo.  There were no other lights emanating from whatever was moving the light along the sky.  There was no vapor trail at all, like the kind that follows an airplane.  I could not see any kind of structure attached to the light.  The flashing white light was the only thing I saw.  There was nothing carrying or holding it that I could see.  I have never seen anything else like it.  It truly looked as if something was taking pictures of our community from way up there. We exclaimed to each other such things as “Did you see that?  Are you seeing this?  Wow!  I see it, yes, I’m seeing it too!  It’s so bright!  What is that?”.  We talked about it for quite awhile afterward. About 3/4 of an hour later, we finally saw one very bright, long meteor flashing from East to West, lower in the sky than the flashing light, and lasting about five seconds, traveling at the same latitude in the sky as the bottom most two stars in the constellation Big Dipper.  Its ending point was directly under the constellation Lyra (but much lower, almost eye level), just where instructions on the internet indicated one should look.   It was definitely a meteor.  We both saw it at exactly the same time, and remarked similarly to “Oh!  Finally!  A meteor!”.  We talked about how it was the largest, longest, and brightest meteor that either of us had ever seen.  It was not anywhere nearly as bright or as large as the earlier flashing light had been, and it had the natural quality of every “shooting star” I have ever seen, not an artificial quality like the earlier flashing light. Later, each of us independently saw a very quick, small, barely visible meteor at separate times.  I missed seeing my sister’s because I was looking through binoculars at Lyra.  Then I saw one a short time later through the binoculars, but my sister didn’t see it because it was small, even through the binoculars, and very fast, and not very bright. We didn’t see anything else that night, and went inside at 2:00 AM on July 30, 2020.",2020-08-06T00:00:00,40.2093,-74.1588

I couldn’t sleep so I went outside to look at the stars. The Moon was overhead, the ocean reflected it on my right.  It was relatively clear with a few clouds. The wind was blowing from the West.  The time span is roughly 2345 – 0015. I checked the clock when I came back in.  Not sure when I went out. Seemed like a half hour.  There was a lot going on.  This is what I remember from the night of 7/30/2020 over the Atlantic. Holden Beach, NC.  I sat and faced South, enjoying the night.  The Moon had things lit up to my right and it grew darker to my left. I noticed a light on the horizon, SSE. (Well left of center if I looked straight out at the ocean).  I thought Oh, a boat or a ship. And started looking at it. Then it disappeared.  Then is was back.  I sat looking at it and a red light streaked out at a 45-degree angle to my right.  No more light.  I couldn’t figure out what I was seeing.  Military? Whatever it was happened way out on the horizon . I strained my eyes to see. Then I saw a light kind of corkscrew out of the same spot. Then a light with a short, wavy path. Same spot. Not travelling far, but enough to see. I started wondering if it was a cruise ship shooting fireworks, but there were no bursts, just lights. Then a light started at the same place and went straight up to about 20 degrees above the horizon, hesitated and then streaked off to the right at roughly 45-degrees. I’m entering the realm of disbelief.! Standing now…  To this point everything had been emanating from the same spot on the horizon. At one point I stared at a light and lowered my glasses to make sure it wasn’t a reflection, then I looked away and looked back to make sure it wasn’t an issue with my eyes. I’m 62. There were streaks emanating from that point upward. Hundreds of them, like someone was shooting at something. Not like tracers, more like faint trails from shooting stars, but going up. Just a bunch of faint lines, making a vase shape. White lights streaked downward toward that spot from different directions occasionally. It was becoming surreal. I thought about waking my wife but I was afraid I would miss something. Looking behind me and getting creeped out.  Then a white light streaked across the sky parallel to the horizon. It came from right to left and traversed most of the sky. It winked out above the spot with all of the activity.  One light appeared a little to my right on the horizon and shot up and right disappearing in a short red line.  Next one started directly in front of me. Maybe 20-25 degrees above the horizon and shot down and to the left in the general direction of the original spot on the horizon. Same thing, short red streak and then nothing.  Saw what appeared to be a couple of dark objects moving together over the water and not on the horizon, but my eyes could have been playing tricks on me.  Now more to my right and entering the brightness of the Moon another light appeared. It was low, but not on the horizon and appeared to be on the end of a cigar shaped object, black and tumbling. Bizarre. Not a lot of logical movement out there. I began wondering if there was some kind on war going on that I don’t know about.  A bright light shot up from the location with all of the activity. It was bigger and brighter than anything I had yet seen. Had the color of an old street light before they started making the amber ones. Kind of an electric green. It moved from the horizon to the cloud in an instant. The clouds were long and made up of small puffy clouds all lined up. The light flew up close to the end of the cloud formation, stopped and made a right angle turn in between the small ‘cloudlets’, lighting them up. Then turned back out from between the clouds and stopped. Not turned, instantly changed direction. It then split into 2 lights. They moved exactly the same, one dropping to the left and one dropping to the right. If you kept the original location it would have probably been an equilateral triangle. I guess I freaked out a little when it lit the clouds and split, because I can’t remember after that. I may have looked away and then back and they were gone.  Hair raised on my arms. I got scared. I watched for a few more minutes. Nothing more happened so I went inside. I woke at 0500 and went back out to see if my eyes were playing tricks on me. The Moon had set and it was pitch black. No lights created by my eyes due to low light. The next morning, I sat down, made notes and drew it out, then went outside and took a picture from where I was observing.  I went out the next night at the same time. The Moon was in a slightly different place and there were no clouds. Nothing.",2020-08-06T00:00:00,,
