I initially discounted it as a helicopter or other aircraft as our home is frequently overflown by the Carolinas Medical Center helicopter and commercial and private aircraft from the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport (25-miles south) and the Concord Regional Airport (8 miles North).  Approximately 1.5 hours before this sighting a single low flying (<500 foot altitude) C-130 flew over at a rapid speed from east to west.  This overflight by C-130 military aircraft occurs on a limited frequency (4-6 times/year) always in the same direction.  This may be irrelevant but I thought it appropriate to include it.  After about 30 seconds the light became brighter and less distant prompting me to go out onto the back step.  The following is a description of what I observed:  In the WSW sky elevated at approximately 15 degrees from horizontal a radiant slightly pulsating symmetrical source of extremely brilliant light was visible. White, blue, green and yellow were the most noticeable colors of light emitted. The light was being emitted in all directions (object or light source appeared to have 3-dimensons). The axis of symmetry for the object was elongated along the vertical axis and compressed along the horizontal.  The light source seemed to stay in one position for about 1.5 minutes then moved off at a moderate velocity until no longer visible 30 seconds later. The size of the object at the distance viewed was approximately that of a Quarter held at arms length. No sounds of any sort were produced. No extraneous sounds from other sources (people, machines or animals) were noticed. It was very quiet.  Weather: Slightly cloudy (altocumulus clouds in western sky)unusually warm 60 Deg F no wind.

I had learned of the comet recently and knew it was bright enough to see without optical aids in a dark sky area and probably visible from most light-polluted areas.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the sky was pretty clear where I live, for it had been raining periodically for what seemed weeks and more rain was due to arrive.  There was plenty of moisture in the air causing the sky look terrible for star gazing; this I know because I am an amateur astronomer.  I grabbed a pair of 7 x 50 binoculars, knowing they would provide much aid in locating the comet under any conditions.  I had looked at a star map on the Internet earlier in the day and knew that I could easily find the right location to look because it would appear near the Pleiades star cluster.  Without using the binos I looked up and immediately saw Orion's belt and then used the bioculars to scan upwards from that point to pass what appeared to be Aldebaran, a bright star in Taurus, and then the Pleiades (which were not very apparent with the naked eye that evening).  As I moved around from Pleiades it only took a few seconds for me to notice a white, faint fuzz ball that I figured was probably the comet.  I only glanced at the object for a second before I decided to mark its position in relation to the other landmarks so I could verify that it was not just a deep sky object like a globular cluster.  I scanned upwards and located the Pleiades (very close to the supposed-comet) and then I started back down.  As I was going over some stars, something about them caught my attention.  I held the binos on an area of sky with what appeared to be quite a few remarkably similar stars close together.  As I was looking I thought I was moving the binoculars because it was a strain to look upwards at the very high angle that this part of the sky was in.  It turned out that I was moving the binoculars ever so slowly and that I was following these lights I had originally thought to be stars.  I was able to discern this because (after a mental double, no, triple-take) I saw the 'regular' stars stationary in the background as these others moved across the sky.  Within a few seconds I counted 9 in my field of view (and recounted), it appeared to be 4 in one group and 5 in another group that were so close together they all could have been just one group of 9.  These lights appeared to me to be a whitish-yellow color; very much like a typical incandescent light bulb in color.  The shape of the light was hard for me to discern, but they could have been a small bar that was perpendicular to their direction of travel.  If it was a bar, the bar appeared to be dimmer on each end leading me to also believe they could have had brighter lights towards the middle of the bar and dimmer ones at the outer edge.  I couldn't be certain of the shape of the lights but I was absolutely certain that all 9 were identical.  And the best part of the whole story is that this 'formation' of 9 lights did not stay in a static array.  The lights were moving amongst themselves changing the 'formation' almost constantly.  It would be impossible for me to tell how far away they were, but if I guessed I would say if they were smaller objects they were probably about as high, and moving as fast, as a commercial jet.  If they were much larger objects I'd say they were about as high, and moving as fast, as a standard orbiting satellite.  I watched them for about 2 minutes and that was long enough to see that they were getting slightly dimmer and slightly smaller as they headed in a southern direction.  The course never changed but the lights were moving among themselves almost constantly - not all of them at once, but maybe four or five being actively moving at any given time.  I put down the binos and went inside to tell my wife and that was that.  I would like to say that I've spent hundreds of hours looking at the night sky with and without binoculars and telescopes and I also look at the sky during the day quite often.  It is incredible how many individual small balloons I've pointed out to my wife as they traverse the sky, undoubtebly escapees from some poor child's clumsy grip.  I also have a habit of noticing aircraft and am particularly joyous when I see military craft as they fascinate me (and I'm fairly good at determining what make they are).  I'm very familiar with the sky and I would be very surprised if there are not at least a few more reports that mirror mine.  I knew that the closest Comet Machholz was going to get to Earth in its orbit was to occur on this particular evening.  Because of that and because of the proximity of my sighting to the comet, I am certain there were other eyes (trained ones, too) looking at that area at that time.  I guess I'll find out soon enough when I enter this site.  On another not, given my awareness of all environmental factors it would be easy for me to get a pretty close fix on the actual location (Right Ascension and Declination) of these objects by using a star map or planetarium program.  Also, I'm checking the box here that says there were aircraft in the vicinity.  The sky here is very busy at this time of the evening but I didn't see any aircraft chasing the objects I saw.

It seemed to be gaining speed and as it neared my vicinity, I was trying to see the blades or the tail of the craft. It was about 1/2 mile away and at 1,000 feet. Thinking it was a helicopter, I thought that it must be on a heading for some crime that occured in our area. But, it didn't slow down. It was picking up speed and then turned northwest and as it did, I could see that it had no wings, tail, or blades. It was shaped like the front of a helicopter and on the back were 3 large round purple sphere. It made no noise and seemed to just glide along. Then, I thought it might be a weather balloon. But, the direction of the winds were easterly at 30 miles per hour due to a rain storm earlier in the am. It was heading against the direction of the wind. It gained altitude about 500 feet and maintained its speed north west. There was no jet trail, or sound of it moving. It was if it was scouting for something or sightseeing our city and the traffic.  I took several pictures with my throwaway camera. They have been developed and you can see a small object in the distance in each photo. But, because I used a cheap camera, anything more than a 1,000 feet away is just a spot.  I called the airport radar tower. They didn't want to say anthing about it.  I called the paper, they just sd send an email and copy of the pic. Oh well, I did see other people in thier cars staring at it. As we were stopped at red light for at least 1 minute.

I noticed an unusual star, or so I thought at first. After watching this 'star' for about a minute, I noticed it moving in a southeast direction at a very slow speed. I could see with my naked eye, several different colors flashing, so I thought it must be an airplane of some sort at a fairly high altitude. I am very knowledgeable regarding aircraft, since I am a licensed commercial pilot and former flight instructor. This 'aircraft' did not appear to be moving at a steady rate of speed. After watching this 'thing' for several minutes, it suddenly split into 3 different and distinct lights. I could not make out what exact shape they were, and at this time I called for my wife to bring out the binoculars. She quickly came out with them and I focused them as quickly as possible. By the time I got them adjusted, the three lights became only one, with the same blinking. We watched this 'thing' for the next 15 or so minutes, me looking through the binoculars and my wife with only her eyes, it suddenly split into 2 distinct lights, one white light shooting straight into the atmosphere, the other white light shooting in a northerly direction. The rate of speed could not be calculated, but it was only a matter of maybe a couple of seconds before the objects were both out of sight. No noise was heard, and I suspect the objects were many miles away and at an altitude again, that could not be judged, but it was most likely above 18,000 feet. The sky at this time was clear, and the big dipper could be observed to our northeast direction.  Other stars were visible also. We then went back inside to eat dinner, and around 730pm I went outside to see if this 'star' was still in the general vicinity, but, of course, it was gone. I've been flying since 1975, hold a commercial license with single engine, multi engine, seaplane, and CFI-II ratings.

At night you can see the lights of Dover Airforce Base across the Delaware Bay.  We were just standing on the beach talking and as I always do I was looking up.  The sky seemed to be very active with planes, and I am always on the lookout, epecially on Fortescue beach, perhaps to just to catch a glimpse of a low flying plane heading in or out of DAB.  We were on the beach or sitting nearby from about 6:30 until 7:30PM  It was already dark.  My boyfriend is a skeptic and has never in his 51 years seen anything that he could call a UFO.  The temperature was about 40 degrees with no wind.  There were some low altitude patchy clouds that seem to be making their way out as I was seeing more and more stars.  There was a slight amount of haziness to the atmosphere, perhaps later in the evening it would turn foggy, but Dover was still visable.  I was watching one light that was about 30 degrees up from the horizon, waiting for it to turn enough or for it to get closer so that I could see the strobe lights blinking and confirm that it was indeed an airplane.  It was white, perhaps a slightly yellow color.  It was out over the water, apparently and about 20 degrees right of the last row of visible lights at Dover.  I was facing for the most part West, perhaps slightly South.  I watched the light move at a what seemed a normal speed for a plane, moving ""right.""  I noticed what seemed like some irregularity in it's speed as it continued moving to the right.  It seemed to slow and speed up slightly, but it was not very obvious.  It then shot up and to the right slightly and very quickly at about a 70 degree angle of accent and about five degrees up.  I then alerted my boyfriend who had been looking elsewhere, never taking my eyes off of it.  We both then saw it move right and slightly up a few more degrees more quickly than the first time I had seen it, but it's erractic speed was more apparent.  It then shot down at about a 45 degree angle with the erractic speed still visible, even though it was moving quickly, only going a few more degrees and then it turned a sharp ""v"" turn, maybe 15 degrees from being directly vertical and much more quickly than before, shot up, got about ten degrees and disappeared apparently into the low lying clouds.  We looked for it, but it was gone.  We watched the sky for half an hour more but never saw anything else like it.  I had a similar experience about a year ago, listed on this website, in Millville, New Jersey, which is about ten miles away.  About fifteen minutes later we had gotten in the car to get warm and were still watching the sky.  We saw coming at us another light, but saw the strobe lights, from the same area of the sky as the unexplained light.  We watched it for less than a minute and we could tell it was headed straight for us, guessing I would say a few thousand feet up.  I watched the white part of the light ""turn"" and get very bright as if a helicopter had made a turn to go right at us.  But it was still too far out to hear the engine.  The light ""turned on a dime"" and we both agreed at that point that it had to be a chopper.  It headed over us within a minute, seemed to be roughly a thousand feet up or more, and we could hear the engine of what sounded like a prop plane, and not a helicopter.  I'm not an expert on planes, but we both got the feeling that we were being checked out, and just assumed that it would be a helicopter, epecially the way it appeared to make a turn directly toward us without having to ""circle around"" like a plane. Perhaps the light ""turning to face us"" makes sense to others who will read this.  There are several houses near the beach but there were only two homes that appeared to be occupied with full time residents.  The road along the beach was otherwise empty of cars.  We have discussed making further observations at this location and I will further document any occurances here.",2005-01-11T00:00:00,39.2376,-75.1716

At first glance it looked like a plane but as it got closer overhead I began to watch and follow its unusual movements and shape.  The object was moving from west to east at a speed that was faster than an airplane, its shape was unrecognizable even though there was a full moon.   The object moved in an erratic nearly snakelike formation.  Many lights could be seen flashing across its middle girth in a very random, flickering red and white pattern.  I couldn’t judge its distance from earth nor its size but I believe it was larger than a plane.  Once the object disappeared in to the eastern horizon, I heard the tremendous trailing noise of a jet-liner back to the east where the object first appeared.  I noticed a flash of dull white light, similar to a lightning flash, illuminating a cloud in the sky, as the rumbling of the aircraft tried to catch up to the object.

That is all any of the three of us remember and in fact we didn't talk about it for almost ten years, like it had been teporarily erased from our memories, until one night when someone brought up UFO's and the three of us spoke up about our experience.

It's highly possible that there was an abduction experience when I was not quite three, and my mother was 23, involving not only us but a busload of soldiers en route to Augusta, GA, in 1957.  But when the incident I'm reporting now happened, I was around 25, and my mother was 45.  I had driven from my suburban Alexandria home to visit my mother in Front Royal, VA, and we decided it was a lovely summer afternoon for a drive.  We went on one of our old favorite rides: to a nearby mountain where an airliner had crashed a number of years before, just up the road from a semisecret military installation.  The road led through some beautiful countryside, and we'd always enjoyed taking leisurely drives and talking about life in general.  My mother and I had seen many UFOs, both together and separately, and had, as mentioned earlier, a bizarre bus trip when I was very young, but on this summer day the conversation was light, and the subject matter was strictly terrestrial... except, of course, for our traditional speculation on what went on at that semisecret military complex out in the boondocks yet so close to DC.  We were travelling north in bright sunlight early in the afternoon... then the next thing we remember, we were travelling south, about 20 miles from where we last remembered being, and the sun was almost setting.  We both seemed to be coming out of a brain fog -- speech was very difficult.  My mother spoke first, saying in effect ""How did we get here, and how can it be this late?"" It took great effort for me to respond that I had no idea.  We literally did not say another word for the remaining forty minutes of the trip -- very unusual for two chatty sorts, especially given the circumstances.  I could not comprehend how I could have been driving in such an apparent fugue state, and that both of us were in the same condition was quite disturbing.  Neither of us could remember a single thing that had happened to us during the five or so hours just past... and neither of us were capable of talking about it -- or talking about anything else, at that time.  Even years later, it was exceedingly difficult for us to discuss the incident beyond the bare known facts, and both of us vividly recalled the incredible introversion of our thoughts on the way back to her house.  But we both, as we managed to admit to each other years later, were positive that we had seen ""something,"" that a craft (UFO) was involved.  Our difficulty talking about this event even years later seemed perhaps the result of a mental block of some sort placed by an outside source.  Especially given our individual and shared histories with UFO sightings (also witnessed by others numerous times), there was little doubt in either of us that we'd had an intense and lengthy encounter with something, and some entities, decidedly not of this world.  The roads we were travelling  My mother was an accountant for a furniture/appliance store, and I was a chef/restaurant owner (physically a bit disabled now, thanks to years of heavy lifting, etc.) and am now a professional artist and writer.  This report is probably only the first in a somewhat long line -- it's time I deal openly with the strangeness in my life that seems to have revolved around UFOs, and this is step one.  I'm very open to discussing the full range of experiences and incidents with an investigator, if you or an associate are interested.  I will also consider hypnosis in order to penetrate the mental veil concealing the two incidents of missing time, providing that the hypnotherapist is reputable and well-versed in probable abduction incidents.  Those two incidents have haunted me for so long -- once for nearly fifty years -- and I'd like to know the truth, however discomfiting it may be.

I think that this happened in the spring/summer of 1982. It might have been 1983, but I am pretty sure that I had just completed my first year of college and I have a vague memory of feeling irresponsible about missing too many days of work at my part-time job. I have to admit that I can't pin this down exactly. I know it happened no earlier than 1982 and no later than 1984. There were green leaves on the trees; the temperature was neither particularly hot nor cold.  I had a close friend who was several years younger. I think I was 19-20 years old, so she was 16 or 17. Her father was a boy scout troop leader, and he, her mother, and other adults were taking their troop camping at Swallow Falls State Park, near Oakland, Maryland. (Here is the url for more information: http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/western/swallowfalls.html.) She was a bit of a problem teen, and there was no way that her parents were going to let her stay home alone while they took the troop to Swallow Falls. She had to go, but they told her that she was allowed to bring a friend. She asked me and I agreed to go along.  Looking at the Swallow Falls camping maps, I believe that we camped in the Youth Group Loop. I’m not sure exactly where on the loop we were positioned (http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/maps/msfmap.html), but my gut tells me we were in camp site number 2 (http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/maps/sfyg.html). I am sure that no one was in camp site 3, but I am not clear if any one was in camp 1. I have no recollection of seeing any other campers outside our party during the entire trip.  The camping loop went fairly deep into the forest of huge old trees. On the first night, there was a heavy rain storm. My friend and I were sleeping on the ground in a small two-man tent. We were utterly miserable; our tent was damp and leaking. It kept raining into the next day, and in fact, by the evening, it was absolutely pouring. We decided to spend the night in her father's car. It was parked facing the loop road, next to the encampment. My friend, who was a tiny person, took the backseat, and I planned to sleep in the driver's seat in recline.  I recall that we sat in the car talking for hours while the rain pounded the car. I don’t remember thunder or lightning, just driving rain and some winds. I don’t think the car had a lighted clock. (Now that I think about it, I’m not sure cars had lighted clocks in the early 1980s.) But I guess it was around midnight.  At some point while we conversed, I noticed a light through the front windshield.  I can remember that it illuminated the hard streaks of rain hitting the glass.  We both stopped talking, so I assume that she also saw the light. I never turned my head to look at her in the back seat as the light wended its way toward us. It was yellow-greenish and about as bright as a car headlight pointed full on very bright. It did not have a defined shape because of this brightness, but I assume its core was round. It moved smoothly, about 3-5 feet from the ground, swerving gently a few times to avoid trees. I remember wondering whether it was a car on the muddy loop coming from camp 1. Then I thought, ""Maybe it’s someone walking with a really bright lantern.""   My last memory of the light is as it reached the front of our car.  I retain an image of it crossing in front of us, as if it was going to follow the loop out of the woods to the parking area.  But I can’t recall it actually doing that.  I think I saw it start to illuminate the tents that were to my right.  The next thing I remember is disorientation then turning around to my friend to say, ""That was weird."" The two of us immediately picked up our conversation from before the light appeared.  After that night in the woods, I didn’t think about the odd light for years. I don’t recall ever mentioning it to anyone until the early 1990s, when I read a description of ball lightning.  How it can glide and make unusual maneuvers. I decided that was what we had seen and mentioned it to my husband and friends.  When I was in my 30s, my friend visited from Arizona, where she then lived. I asked her if she remembered that night in the car. She did, except for the light. In her memory, we sat in the car talking in the driving rain until we fell asleep.  Now, after another decade of consideration, I’m no longer sure what I saw was ball lightning and lean more toward a UFO-type experience or that I am simply misremembering an event with a rational explanation: a car; a camper.  I have to rule out it was a vehicle for several reasons. First, there was only one light, not two, although I concede it could have been a car with one headlight. But I don’t remember a car. Second, the only source for a car would have been camp site 1. From where I sat, site one would have been at approximately 1 o’clock. I would have been at roughly 7 o’clock. My memory is of the light coming toward us from about 10 o’clock, out of the woods. I don’t remember seeing camp site 1 occupied. If it was, and this was a car from that site, why would they drive the long way around the unpaved, muddy loop in the storm to exit into the parking area?  Was it a person with a lantern? It might have been someone armed with an incredibly bright light, but I don’t remember a person. I’ve wondered if it was someone from camp site 1 walking to the toilets. I personally have no memory of the bathhouse that is shown on the youth group loop detail, however, a site 1 camper would again be taking a very long route to get to the toilets, through driving rain on a muddy trail.  I also wonder about the disorientation I felt. I don’t know exactly what time it was when the light appeared, so I don’t know if we were missing time, but something felt wrong. I also wonder why my friend and I never discussed it, and why I barely recalled the incident until I read the description of ball lightning years later. I don’t remember any other experiences that could be construed as abductions. Perhaps they were coming for her? We had a falling out in the late 1990s and no longer are in touch or I’d ask her if she has had further experiences. Aliens? A one-headlight car? Another camper? Ball lightning? I don’t know what I saw that night and I never will, I suppose. It’s been bothering me so much recently that I thought I should file a report.

We all saw what I am about to describe-  three lights in a triangular form, though we never saw the form of the vehicle.  They floated, hovered and moved slowly.   The lights were equidistant from one another, and they were white--and very very bright.  They remained the same distance from each other, the entire time, and it appeared to be 3 lights on the same craft.  I never saw an acutal craft, just the lights of it.   The lights moved FAR to slowly to be a normal object (like a plane), and at times didn't appear to be moving at all. I realize that objects appear to move slower than they actually are, the farther away they are.  I know that objects can look smaller than they are the farther away they are.   Over the years, as I have tenatively, and cautiously shared this story with a few select people, I have been given the following explanations.  ""Sue, you probably saw an airplane.""   Well, do airplanes hover?   Are there lights completely equidistant, like the lights on the point of an equilateral triangle?   Do they hover? I know that they can appear to hover, if they are far enough away. But the size of these lights made it impossible for them to have been that far away. Suggestion number 2:  ""Maybe you saw a spot light.""   Maybe...if there were three spotlights and they moved in a straight line, and all moved together;  and, if they hovered. Suggestion number 3:  ""Maybe your eyes were playing tricks on you.""   Okay... for over half an hour, that's a long time for my eyes to adjust to the night light, whatever.

It was a summer's night and I'd recently had an intense religious experience.  I had become a Christian in the traditional sense of accepting Jesus/God into my soul/heart.   I was outdoors praying very, very intensely.  The most intensely I've ever prayed.  Suddenly I heard a voice in my head say to look around behind me.  I turned and saw a large white brilliant light that was sparkling like a 100,000 glitter-sticks.  It was slowly moving, soundlessly, across the sky, above the tree-tops, and above my parent's house.  It was silent.   It suddenly just dissappeared. No noise, no smoke, nothing.  I did not see or hear anything after the incident.  It scared me.   I walked quickly into the house.  I felt at the time that I'd experienced a ""close encounter"" with an alien of some sort.  I was truly afraid.   I walked into my parent's house, went immediately to my mother's desk, and wrote a poem about titled, 'The Light.'  I told others what I'd seen.  Some were interested, some not, but the Youth Director at my church took the poem and sent it to some publishers.  I did not know he'd done this until he approached me one day and said that he'd done so and had two offers to print the poem.   I was paid money for my permission.  One magazine printed the poem and illustrated a young man looking up into the sky at a brilliant light.   Something of interest is that before I this incident, I'd seen what looked like a very unusual ""shooting star,"" several times.  Each time I saw it, it seemed to be closer and closer to me.  It was quite unusual and got my attention.   I've not seen the light again, but have seen other things, including an angel, or at least what I perceived as one.   I am a mature adult, a medical professional, and I would have absolutely no reason to lie or joke about this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in the summer of 1984 is approximate.

I was eight years old when this event occurred, I was sitting with my baby sister in a pontiac convertible while my brother was sitting in the front seat with my Mother. We all had mixed emotions. My Mom was frightened, I wished to leave the car, and she kept screaming for me not too! She recently died.  Until now I was not allowed by my family to discuss the event. We held it in our family. My brother has zero problems talking about this, nor my sister but my Mom was frightened to a point where she tried to speed away in our car, however time stopped, we could not move! It was really fascinating I thought?  I knew all about UFO encounters as my father was in the Korean war and the US Air Force.  This occurred while we were heading home from my grandmothers home in Short Hills, NJ on Old Short Hills Road prior to reaching Walnut Street in Livingston. I remember the UFO was hovering near the property that had a hidden resevoir behind it, and alot of power lines. I lived on the East Orange Resevoir in Livingston NJ and knew that some people thought UFO's where seen near water, so I was use to going and playing and ice skating on the resevoir and had zero fear, however my Mother would not allow the door to open and the car only had two front doors, and she remained fixed behind the wheel of the Pontiac convertible. I asked her years later why this scared her and she refused to speak ever about it.   However when I arrived home to Baker Road, I phoned my Dad whom worked in the Menlo Park Mall in Edison he owned a furniture store there.  He was working late that night.  I do recall we left during semi-daylight and arrove home in the dark!   He told me to call the Morristown Airport and report it! I did, at a small age, I never forgot this experience and have had an insatiable yet calm interest and patience abpout this topic.  I was married in 1977 at the young age of 17 years old, and when I told my future husbands Mother about how I had witnessed a UFO, she declared,"" Wow, I saw it along with most of my eight children and my husband, who at that time worked for Bell Labs in NJ,  My Dad was working close to the Thomas Edison Labs in Edison NJ at that time.  We always wondered, if this UFO had something to do with the fact we did marry and have a son?  Many years later yet young as teens. I do truly believe that the UFO's come out of the Bermuda Triangle and are seen by many.  I saw on the news in the 1990's UFO's hovering over Phoenix, that was not like our experience.  Time stopping, I remember the exact clearing in the woods where this occurred, the exact home it happened in front of too. It is amazing to me that I am now 47 and this still perplexes me although I realize my Mom was aware of military interogation, blue book files etc, from my Father collecting Time Magazines, and the fact he always was into the paranormal!  Alot of people in my immediate family saw this occur, aprox 13 of us are alive to talk about it.  I have drawn it, however do not share it. I feel that we all have individual incounters and that they may be helping or hurting us? I do not want to open a pandora's box. I feel this is how my Mom was protecting me and my siblings, or I could have been reporting a encounter of the third kind or missing! I am glad I am not doing that. I wish all of you success. Do you realize that the UFO's are hanging out near the USA submarine bases? Look on the World Map? I do not know but would like to if they are hanging around other countrys submarine bases? They are built by General Dynamic's and Electric Boat, the fact that our Star Wars program has begune makes me feel like I just may see one soon, since I live near the Bangor Wa submarine base now? Who knows? It can not be a cooincidence, your tracking is excellent in my mind. Keep up the fantastic work and I will report any others I happen to see, to the US Navy or Marines since my son is a US Marine he told me I may have had response had I called them in NJ, way back when I was a little girl. True story, no additions. The craft was circular and looked invisible however you could see windows and lights. Within the circle. when I was interogated by my Dad in a most professional way, and this is more then likely why I have such a memory! I told him exactly what I am telling you, This craft flew over us, and then all of the cars behind us could move, and my Mother could have had a speeding ticket~! However we got home safe, and I wrang Dad He was excited and wanted to know more, at such a young age I was allowed to stay up late and explain and try and draw what I saw! It was round, perfectly, looked to have some sort of craft in the center, like if it were spinning or creating a temporary worm hole? It had beings in it, as they gazed at me out of tiny slits, within the outer ring, sort of how Jupiter has rings this one had one bright light ring belt around it.the center looked like an inverted bubble, unlike all of the drawings my Father had seen elsewhere mine was upside down? He did not question me. I still stick to seeing what I did indeed see, my brother remember it too. I have not asked my little baby sister because I do remember she was in a car seat at this time, so she was a baby of around two, it would definitely be in her memory from Dad bragging that his wife and family saw a UFO for real!",,40.7871,-74.3291

Hi, I'm an engineering student from New Delhi, India. Before describing the actual details of what happened that night, please allow me to describe the general geographic background. New Delhi, though an emerging cosmopolitan city is still lacks from high rises and military exercises which are anyways apparent during the republic day rehearsal and that too once an year or two in the locality i live in. The gist being, its a calm locality at night where one can see all the stars as clearly as in any other location. Ever since i was a little child, i had always been taking routine walks on my terrace late at night after studies or for a cigarette or two. The time period ranges from any where between 12 AM to 3 AM, with most of the visits occurring after 2 AM. Date: 21st July 2006. Time: Around 0150 hrs. During my yet another late night walk, i saw a huge ball of light emanating from something which looked spherical in its shape. I am not able to describe it's exact shape, but because of the light that was coming out from it, it resembled a sphere which was on fire. I am totally into astronomy and space sciences and for long have been an observer or night skies, hence, i am completely able to discern a commercial aircraft from something this spectacular. The UFO (as I'll call it) was spotted on the eastern horizon, almost exactly aligned with my line of sight. It was not a light coming from a Mobile Receiving Station, it was very high up in the sky and was non moving. For once, i decided not to pay any attention as generally i don't expect such things to crop in New Delhi sky (i thought they could only be a part of lives of people belonging to developed countries) But once it stayed still at its position, different from any air borne object i've seen in my whole life, i came to deciphering that it has got to be something Unidentified. i kept a close look at that thing. To describe more about its appearance, it looked like lots of stars have conjoined into one object to emanate a big ball of fire, which some times kept low and sometimes kindled to life again. (By this time, it was already 3 - 4 minutes into the whole phenomenon) Out of anything that came into my mind, i decided to light a cigarette, i went to bring a cigarette from a room which is on my terrace itself, but to my utter amazement, i could now see the same Craft from a big frame less window from that room itself. It had the same properties - stayed still in the air, glowing very very brightly and differently from any other object in the sky. To confirm what i was seeing was the same Craft i saw 4 minutes ago, i rushed back to the same spot where i had spotted it initially. And to my utter amazement - It Was Not There. I went back to that window again. I could now see it brightly staying still in my south - western line of sight. The ""thing"" had almost covered more than half of New Delhi within seconds of its appearance and disappearance. I rushed to the stairs to call my father and by this time i could see the ""thing""'s light going down slightly. But when i bought my father upstairs to witness the phenomenon, it was not there. Date: 22nd July 2006. Time: ~ 2315 hrs My little reported seeing exactly the same kind of Craft (that is today at the time of writing this) of exactly the same appearance and at exactly the same position.

I would have reported this sooner if I had known your organization existed. I just learned of your site from the Discovery channel. The date of the siting is within 30 days of event date.  I live in the northern most part of Bakersfield California, In a small sister city called Oildale.  My son and I left our house traveling west bound on seventh standard road  just as the sun was setting, The sun had already dropped behind the mountians, but the sky was still illuminated enough to see. The moon was in the southwest portion of the sky over the city of bakersfield. The moon was halfway between straight up and the horizan, The sky was completely clear.  There was enough light from the sunset that you could still makeout a blue tint to the sky.  The moon was 1/3 crescent and looked like a giant sized cereal bowl slightly tilted as if it was spilling some of it contents. Thats what attracted my attention to the moon and I said to my son jokenly, Look the moon looks like a cereal bowl, maybe thats what GOD eats his breakfast out of.  My son who was 12 years old at the time started asking me some questions about the moon so I pulled off the road to look at the moon safely. We exited the car looked and talked about the moon for 2 or 3 minutes or so and just after I answered his last question. ""remember the sky is clear and there is still just enough light to see faint blue sky"". The background was faint blue sky.  As we both where looking directly at the moon something like a dark, fuzzy like cloud started to move in front of the moon from the left side to the right, But there was no clouds. None! It was like the cloud/ship? was only visible as it moved in front of the moon and only at the right edge of the moon as it moved across.  This is where it really get strange and hard to discribe.  As this thing moved from the right side of the moon to the left, as more of it moved in front of the moon it changed from fuzzy dark smoky cloud looking to horizontal lines as it moved across in front of the moon. But the lines where like see through so you could see the moon through it. But you could still make out the lines.  It was like this ship, craft whatever it is. Was projecting an image from the outerspace side of it to the earth side of it and was having technical difficulties and not doing a very good job of it.  It only seemed to have trouble projecting the moons image, Because before it moved in front of and after it passed the moon it was invisible.  As for the size. It must have been huge because it covered the whole moon with its lines/image as it passed. The lines where something like when you get to close to a bigscreen TV. It was like there was a image line then a thinner black line then image line then thin black line etc.  The speed seemed slow. It took aprox 2 min maybe slightly less to pass completely in front of the moon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Flying north across Lorane Valley (southwest of Eugene - several miles west of I-5). White lights on each tip. One bright searchlight in center. The searchlight scanned the earth (across Lorane Valley and the hills and valleys to the west.) Because it took a long time to fly south to north over the valley (most planes fly it in a few minutes), and it was able to send the light over such a distance east to west, my sense was that the craft was at typical plane altitude or higher. However, it was so enormous that it was hard to tell.It seemed like it was in low gear - flying straight and steady. The searchlight was scanning back and forth (I thought it might be a defense operation practice). Yet, it felt creepy. It scanned my yard, and I moved under a tree so as not to be seen! When I went back into the house, I asked my friend how long I had been gone. I was only half joking. The experience was more than simply visual. It was so big, so quiet, and the searchlight was so bright that I felt like something ""special"" had happened - although not a pleasant special. I am a skeptic about UFOs - maybe because I don't want to think about how scary ETs might be. But, I don't drink, do drugs, and I am a relatively sane, balanced person. I don't usually get scary feelings; I don't imagine things. I certainly am not inclined to watch the skies for UFOs. I pushed the experience to the back of my mind, until I heard about a black triangle book, and that others had seen them. Figured I better get my visual on record as well. Wonder what they are?!!

I cannot remember the exact date...it must have been in April or May of 2000. After it was over my date and I were driving to Rapid City from Pine Ridge (not sure of exact road) to spend the night there. On our drive, some time after 11:00pm, she and I were driving along before you get to Red Shirt when we noticed a strange light in the sky on her side of the car about a mile (not too sure, it was hard to tell). We could tell that it was definitely abnormal because it was some sort of flying object but it was way to low to be a plane or anything else in the middle of nowhere SD. Then all of a sudden, almost instantly the object was about a few hundred feet from us on her side still, probaly 50-70 feet off the ground moving parallel with us. It stayed right along with us for maybe 30 seconds, not long, before it just shot off as fast as it had pulled up. Then, a moment later it re-appeared again, this time on my side of the car about the same distance away and high. It paced with us again for about another 30 seconds and as we approached about a few miles from Red Shirt the object shot off again. We pulled into Red Shirt and drove around the small housing area just to gather our thoughts because while all of this happening, the most typical of things occured.  I know it sounds lame to say, but while the object was in our sight, like within a few hundred feet, all of the electric functions in my car began to go crazy. My headlights turned off and on, as did the hazard lights, the stereo, dashboard lights, I mean everything. We even had this junky car phone, which was cool at the time, now it is a piece of junk, but even it started making beeping and ringing all kinds of sounds. It wasn't until I realized that I couldn't control what was going on that I instantly thought what to do if the car shuts down. That was the first moment I remember when a bit of panic set in. At first, I was completely in awe. I remember being almost completely fascinated with what we were looking at but it wasn't until the electronics started going awry that I realized that my date had completely tried almost to hunch down into her foot area of the passenger seat. Then I kind of snapped out of the ""awe"" and started to feel panic. I remember trying to speed up but that didn't do anything but mainly I remember just thinking to myself to not let the car stop. It was truly the strangest thing i've ever experienced.  To be completely honest, even though it was only about 6 years ago, I really don't remember that many details as I think about it. I remember the lights were different colors, but none were distinct, like they weren't like christmas lights where there is blue, a green, a red. These were more like yellows and reds I think and I remember they were all in what seemed like the outside ring of the object, not on top or below. And I don't really remember what shape the object was, it was really dark on the road. I just remember being really awestruck, almost excited, and then overtaken by a bit of panic and it was over.  I remember we tried telling people right after that but nobody thought much of it. I told a few close friends but I, just like them, really wouldn't think much of it unless I saw it for myself. This honestly happened, and I have no problem talking about it to anyone but, either people don't care or probaly don't believe me. I tried to bring it up only one time with the girl who was with me that night since then but I could tell that she really didn't want to talk about it so I guess we'll just leave it at that.  I told my grandfather a few years ago who lived in outside of Pine Ridge for many years and he said that he would sit outside at nights and watch all sorts of flying objects fly similar routes. He never say anything like what I saw or anything as close but he thought it was just some sort of test or practice flying that pilots from Ellsworth were doing at night and what I saw was probaly just something that Ellsworth was testing, not aliens or that type of UFO's.

Two of us took a quick hike to the nearby ridge to get a better look.  I thought at first that it was a campfire (it looked like a flame), but when we got a better look it was clear that the object was floating in the sky just above the trees; and it was lighting up the ground below it.  It seemed to change shape (sort of like how a flame moves and changes); and its colors were a bright redish-orange.  The object moved very slow, but it did hover around methodically; yet not really precise either.  There was absolutely no sounds from the object.  The phenomenon lasted for about 10 minutes; and then the object literally shot into the sky at speeds that I didn't think were possible.

There were no street lights of any kind.  I worked 2 jobs and was leaving for what they call the midnight shift at a convience store in Gainesville.  As i was backing out of my yard and going forward to the dirt path/road thru the field (which had not been mowed for sometime, and was taller than me)i got chills going up my spine.  I felt like i was being watched, but it was so dark out and with no lights,you can't see what is out in the fields.  I do not know why i did what i did next, i turned my car off, opened the door, got out and looked up.  I was in awe at what i was seeing.  This craft was rectangular in shape and had to be the size of a football field.  It seemed so close, i almost felt i could reach out and touch it.  Not one sound came from this object and it had about 6/8 dull>non flashing red lights on the bottom.  We just sat there and watched each other for about 3/4 minutes (yes, i knew they could see me, just can't explain how i know).  It then started moving NE very slowly not making a sound.  How could something that large not make a sound.  I kept watching them leave, when all of sudden, it went from slow to gone with a flash of light. Of course no one believed me.  Then about 1yr later, and i thought i was dreaming.  I was standing outside by my electric pole, watching this same craft leave.  I did not want it to leave, for whatever reasons i do not know, i was saddened by its departure. I could smell the crisp morning air and feel the dew on my feet>>it was so real.

At one particular point, I was the only car on the road, and it was pitch black (no street lights), and I was driving past a farm field with woods surrounding both sides of the road.  It was then that I noticed a large rectangular object hovering over the trees to my right and slowly starting to move across the sky in a northeastern direction.  This object was completely lit with many colorful lights on it's underside.  I remember being completely aware of what I saw, and knew at the time that it certainly could not have an airplane, because of it's shape and many, many underlying lights.  It was completely rectangular, approximately the size of a football field.  I also remember thinking, ""I can't believe there aren't any other cars on the road to witness this with me.""  Although I thought that was strange that I was alone to see this, I also felt very certain that I was supposed to see this. It's as if it waited for a car to come by so it could show itself.   As it slowly crossed over the road ahead of me and headed toward the trees, it disappeared with no sound.  I felt this was a very deliberate incident.

I had an overwhelming urge to go to Covent Garden which was unusual as I try to avoid tourists places.  My partner and I took our daughter and her friend to the swimming pool and went off for a drink at the opera terrace.  It was a bright clear day with not a cloud in the sky. My partner went to get the drinks and I sat at a table.  Looking up, I saw a silver disc in the sky. I couldn't tell you how far away it was or what size it was as I had nothing to compare it with. The waitress came to clear the table and I said to her 'Look at that,' pointing at the craft. She said it looked fantastic but took no further interest.  I spoke to the people on the next table and they said it was great but when I suggested it was a ufo they turned their backs and didn't want to know.   I showed it to my partner and we watched it for a while.  Passenger aeroplanes passed by without it moving but then it went away. A light silver plane flew over and when it had gone the craft reappeared.  We watched it until it disappeared again and a Harrier jump jet flew over rather slowly. When it passed the craft returned. It was almost a spiritual experience. Every so often clouds of luminous substance I presume were ionic bursts of blue and orange were emitted from the craft. It was a truly amazing sight looking down on the streets with all the people walking by, bulders high up on construction sites and nobody aware of the craft. A heliuum filled balloon escaped and flew off in a different direction. It was as though all this was happening to remove all doubt that it could only be a craft. We had to collect our daughter and I said to her and her friend do you want to see a ufo and they laughed thinking I was having a joke.  Walking back through Covent Garden I saw some one with a camera and asked him to take a picture but he could not speak English ! and I di dn't pursue the matter. We watched the craft until about 7.00pm. It did the most amazing thinks, appearing and disappearing instanly it was like blinking. Then a sort of brown cloud appeared around it and it disappeared and then returned. Eventually I had to take the children home. This happened a few years ago but it is very much in my memory. I have a degree in analytical chemistry and was wearing a new set of contact lenses. As a child I had many dreams of being abducted by aliens. One vivid one was of flashing lights at my bedroom window. I lived in a large house overlooking Elswick Park in NEwcastle upon Tyne England. In this dream I was the only person left. The aliens had everyone I knew and many other people I don't know where but I was aware of being the only one conscious. I also had dreams of beings in my bedroom thsat were so frighteneing that I would have to sleep with the light on and would always get into trouble for it but the trouble was never worse than the fear. Playing in the park one day I noticed a lump under my skin on my knee cap. I could mmove it around under the skin. It is not there now and I have not had it removed. There is more things in my life but can be interpreted in rational terms so I will not go into them here. I have often wondered about hypnotic regression to see if it would reveal more of my dreams but am unsure about the technique. After seeing the craft I looked into ufo's and alien abduction so my mind may be contaminated with this information. I am still unsure whether to be contacted by an investigator but I assure that what I have written is true and would testify to it in a court of law or on anything that I hold dear. Thank you.

We drove to the top and parked on the overlook.  She was still driving her green 47 Chevy, she left the engine running and the heater on.  We noticed two triangle shaped objects comming down the Hudson from the direction of the George Washington Bridge they seemed to be at an altitude lower than us. They came very close, perhaps 1/4 mile or closer. We were looking down on them they were above the water perhaps 300-400 feet. As they passed the Chevy stalled and the Heater blower also stopped. The Blower started running when they were some distance out to sea.  About two minutes later two aircraft that I think they were F-80's they had wing tanks. Shortly there after the two objects flew past and up the Harbor toward the George Whashington Bridge at a high rate of speed the two F-80 were close behind.  The objects appeared to be playing with the jets. They slowed down and sped up a couple of times turned sharply and headed out to sea over Coney Island.

It was a perfect summer day, and I was with my mother outside the kitchen door of our home.  I was with two friends and we were discussing the subject of lunch with my mother.   One of us looked up, pointed, and we all looked up over Lake Pocotopaug, into a cloudless sky.  We observed about six silver discs (flying saucers) flying in a loose formation. They were absolutely silent.  There were no obstructions in our view of them.  It was an amazing sight.   At that age, I was not yet exposed to science fiction, and this was all new to me.  The craft floated (for lack of a better word) at a speed of perhaps several hundred miles an hour (relatively slow) towards us, then turned left out of our view.   Afterward we all discussed what we saw, agreed we all saw the same thing, and then my mother, ((name deleted)), told all of us that we should not discuss what we saw.  At that age we obeyed, but I never got to query my Mom about the incident before she died.  It was such an important event in my life that I have always remembered it.   I am 58 years old today, and I want to submit this report today, before my recollection is forever lost.  It also may be substantiated by other viewings.   In respect to the craft themselves, the were saucer like with bubble tops.  It's almost embarrassing to report this as modern fiction has capitalized on this vision.  The craft were basically silver but with colors of red and blue.  I used to know where all the colors of red and blue were, but I have forgotten.  Using my experience at the time, I used to say that the edges of the craft were wavy like the heat coming off a hot summer asphault(sp) road.  I now watch on TV theories of gravitation, etc. and see similar results.  All I can say is that for my craft, they were solid objects with fuzzy edges.

I was 18 years of age, so this was a while back, but after supper one evening, my father and I took a usual short walk through a school yard next to our house.  From behind, over my right shoulder, I noticed a flying craft.  It was low enough to tell it was nothing but a flying disk. I pointed and said ""Look!"".  It went overhead, flying low and not making a sound nor leaving any contrail. We did nothing but stood still and quiet and noticed that it had no rivets or seams in the metal.  The sides didn't come to a pointed edge but were somewhat rounded.  I could see no windows and regret that I hadn't seen the front of the craft.  It moved at a steady rate of speed and, withing minutes or less, went over the hills in the distance.  To my knowledge, no one else in the small town saw it and I can understand why as it was completely silent and, if seen from the side, would probably be hard to see.  But this went right overhead.  Needless to say, we were frightened and not quite believing what we were actually witnessing.  My father has died within the past few years, but we talked about what we saw to each other many times. This sighting is absolutely true, but I have never posted it before now.  I have mentioned to others, throughout the years, but found only a few who would believe it.

This bottom section was surrounded by colored lights that did not revolve but rather flashed.  It was hovering over a parking lot on a sunday afternoon and was less than 100 feet off the ground.  It wasn't shinny but more of a dull metallic finish. It also made no noise.  My best friend noticed it first and fell off his bike.  I only noticed because I heard the crash of his bike as I was riding next to him.  He was staring up and speechless.  I too was startled but I asked him if we should call the police.  Mind you I was only 10 years old and inexperienced at this.  He didn't answer and at that point the lights on the bottom section instantly began to spin at a greater revolution than before and flew off in a straight line disappearing over the hudson river in a matter of no more than 5 seconds.   There was only a slight humm eminating from the craft as it accelerated.  My friend was not able to function in school for a long period of time after this.  He would just stare blankly at the chalkboard.  I attempted to verify this event with him 15 years later after we grew up.  Even then he was visably upset and did not want to talk about it, waving me off whenI began to ask the question.  I have not seen another object day or night since this occurred.

When I was about 13 years, a student of astronomy, interested in aircraft, and the NASA “space program”, I saw a UFO.  I was at that age a model rocket, math, and science enthusiast.  As an adult I graduated with an engineering degree.  On this special day, it was clear and sunny.  It was in the month of July.  The sky was blue with few clouds and maybe 90 F.  The winds were clam.  I first noticed it coming from the North floating towards the South or South Southeast.  Its speed seemed slow but did travel in a straight line of flight.  The object shape was clearly a rectangle.  Note, it was only a two dimensional object - no thickness.  You could not see through it.  Its color appeared as if it were a solid black - no color changes.  It floated along as if it were a plastic sheet one would hold by hand along the short side in front of a strong fan watching the greater length of plastic flutter very very slowly yet perpendicular to the fan face.  It remained level and with no sound, always keeping the same altitude, same speed, and same direction.  I followed it for nearly 20 minutes and was finally unable to continue.  It just continued southward, in the same direction, same altitude, same speed, unabated.  To ascertain a speed relative to ground, I estimate a segment distance of travel of 500 feet.  During that distance it traveled that distance in about 1 minute.  To estimate the size of the UFO, I would compare it to holding in my out stretched something 1.5""x3.0"" in size in my hand.  As far as I know I was the only one to see it.  Comment: Over the years I often wondered if it were nothing more than a plastic sheet floating along.  But anyone experienced in kite flying would know that any flat plastic sheet would not stay aloft parallel to the earth indefinitely as this object.  I felt when watching it as if it were a hole in the sky.  Almost as if I and the homes were being observed.  I was never frightened.

One voice very powerfully vibrated through the air and me said, ""I AM JEHOVAH, the Father Almighty, the Creator Almighty."" (note: this means the tetragrammaton. i was standing there amazed, with a broom in my hand and i noticed i was still holding it and i immediately thought of the moses movie and took off my shoes and put the broom on the ground and did the same thing, got on the floor on my knees, and started praising God.  i thought to ask HIM. HE asked me to be HIS Wayshower, and showed me a vison of a misty white large road in the sky with viscous black walls on either side, and that the light of the Creator fell on on this road.  HE said, ""If anyone argues with you about what you think, do say and testify to leave them by the wayside."" i was shown a image of me grown up as an adult showing a indian man into the viscous wayside, where GOD looked down on his entrapped form crying and turned away from him with finality.  i then said l""let everything i think, do say and testify to be of you and not of myself so that otheres will know you have sent me."" then i worshipped THEM and i looked up from where i was bowed and they were gone.  in the afterward, my foster monm and two child siblings entered the house and said to me ""what happpened? you're glowing very bright."" I was lit up like a neon sign, and they put a sheer curtain over my head so they could look at me.  afterwards, there was a ufo silver disk, with a bulging ring of protholes, about 15' across that landed in the next week while i was up at the nextdoor neighbors camping out and i ws ""abducted"" from the tent, given a physical examination and tatooed with an egyptian heiroglyphic that is the name for NIT- a weaving shuttle- on my right groin area over the ovary.  my stomach bulgeed and i felt like i had radiation sickness for the next 2 weeks, causing my family to be tightlipped and very worried, but they refused to tell anyone because my dad worked for the government.  the blue book came out and white curtained the area of the landing, because the craft burnt depressions into the asphalt road at the bend right past the house where i lived.  I peeked over the edge of the hill and was pspotted and photographed (glowing) because i wanted to see what was going on behind the white curtains. that fall, the family doctor gave everyone a complete physical examination and photographed my tatoo for the FBI (i saw the markings card marked FBI which the doctor with alot of excalamations filled out and took a one step polaroid picture of the mark.  i didn't tell him the truth.  and that began to be the first of countless ufo contacts with the good guys of Heaven.  unfortunately, years later, the two other girls with me in the tent have succumbed to cancer, although that didn't happen till they hit their adult years.  i began to be very talented and did amazing things which my foster family couldn't get over, like levitation and fire shooting from my hands and body.  i was a pretty good little girl, and i was known as a mindreader and very pronounced psi talented.  athere were other events, but this is where it first started, although i remember instances in milpitas california as a baby where shadowy ""white"" people like ghosts used to come into our house and visit me, telling me not to forget what i was here for, to be with me when i was scared at night, etc.  alot about don't forget the promise, the plan.  that's all for now.  these are not all the details of what happened the first time for me on doerner road in oregon.  oh, and the guys that got off the craft were humanlike, with golden blonde short, curly hair and gold and purple close fitting jumpsuits and white silverish boots.  they didn't seem to have seams in the clothes who piloted the craft that burnt the holes in the road.

I am responding to a sighting reported on this site on 7/15/2004.  I was telling coworkers about what I experienced when I was nine years old at my elementary school about my UFO sighting.  One of my coworkers went on your website and found where someone else had reported basically the same thing that I experienced.  This happened at school and from memory it was called Crestview Elementary School and was in Opa Locka, Florida.  This happened in 1966 from my recollection.  We were in school and all of a sudden our teacher told us to be very quiet and not get up from our seats.  It seemed like we were sitting there forever, when finally I began to see Military men with Air Force hats (caps) on walking around outside our classrooms.  They came from the Homestead Air Force Base.  I was told that later.  I remember that finally they allowed the kids who walked home or rode bikes home were allowed to leave the school.  As I was leaving I remember looking to the North by the playgrounds and looking up towards the street light and saw a shiny silver disk shaped saucer (ufo) by the street light.  I remember my mom asking me why I was home from school early and I told her to call the school that they sent us home early.  One block over from us lived the Science teacher who had her classroom in the portables in the playground.  My mom talked to her and she said that if you hear that something landed next to the portable that it was true.  She said that she was worried about her job so she wasnt suppossed to talk about it so that is why she told my mom that if she heard about something landing at school it was true but did not come right out and tell her that that is what happened.  I wanted to assure the person who reported this to you on 7/15/2004 if they are still looking for someone who remembers this incident, I do.  Just like they said, it seemed exciting to us, but I was scared also.  Probably because of the appearance of so many military men in our hallways at school.  I seem to think that something was printed in the paper about this being a weather balloon.  I agree with the other person who reported this incident to you about the military doesn't evacuate schools due to weather balloons and they would not seem worried as they seemed to be to me.

It was very bright and it traveled from the moon to a star and then stopped for a few moments. It then started again and went to another star and stopped.  At this point I was quite excited and convinced my mother to stop the car at which point she and I got out and proceeded to watch this thing.

South of Richmond, but north of Berea.  All four of us saw an object overhead, directly in front of us, with an apparant altitude of a few hundred feet.  The size cannot be estimated because the actual altitude could not be determined, as there were no clouds or hills, mountains, etc., behind the object..  The object was round, and glowing with a white color, giving an appearance similar to that of a floresent light, but round, i.e. a circle shape.  At that time, so far as I was aware, flouresent lights were only tube shaped, whether straight, or sometimes bent into a circle.  I am referring only to the type of light produced by the object.  The object had an apparant size larger than a full moon, and the brightness was similar to that of a full moon on a clear night.  It was definitely NOT, however, the moon.  The object was hovering, moving very slowly from east to west.  As we watched, the object suddenly accelerated to a speed far faster than it would seem would be possible within the laws of physics, and moved beyond the western horizon so quickly that it was virtually instantaneous.  At the point of the sighting, we were going down a long slope on the interstate, and the terrain was such that there was a very wide, unobstructed view toward the western horizon, of several miles.  ""Accelerted"" is actually not the correct word, because ""acceleration"" implies that the speed increased from a slow speed to a faster speed through a process of going faster and faster.  To the contrary, the object appeared to have NO TRANSITION from the slow east to west hover to a speed which covered miles from our location to the western horizon in, perhaps, a hundreth of a second.  The four of us agreed that we would not report the incident because of the ridicule that we would probably suffer.  About six years after the sighting, I saw a newspaper story in the Louisville Courier-Journal newspaper about a professor at Eastern Kentucky University, which is located in Richmond, who was gathering information about a large number of unexplained UFO sightings in the Richmond area over the previous several years.  The article pointed out that the US Army Bluegrass Depot, a storage area for nerve and other weapons grade gases, and perhaps other weapons, is located just south of Richmond.  I wrote to the professor, telling him about  the sighting in 1969, and offering to meet with him if he wished  He returned my correspondence, saying to contact him if I was in Richmond in the future, but did not seem anxious to hear the details of the sighting.  I never met with him.  All three of the observers who were students at the time are now professionals: an accountant, a pharmacist, and an attorney.

We called the State Police they put us on hold after we told them what we saw.  No one ever came back to the phone.  While we were waiting on the phone, the light landed behind the trees. Just before it landed, it flashed a bright light. It lit up everything around us that we could see for about 5 seconds. The closest way to describe it is a gas stove.

After the flash everything seemed normal.  My mom got a little nervous we went inside and watched though the windows.  We watched for about a half hour or so we never saw it take off.

After stopping at such close proximity to us, I notice that it resembled 2 large bell shaped search lights with tremendous candle power. I could not see what they were attached to, but I assume that these 2 large lights were attached to something. Then the large search lights started to scan the ground traveling in opposite directions and then reversing similtaneously and moving in the other direction. They appeared to be search lights searching for something. After scanning back and forth several times the lights started moving toward the horizon at a slow rate of speed. I observed these 2 lights until they disappeared over the horizon all the time scanning the lights back and forth as if searching for something. My girlfriend cried and begged me to leave. She would not get out of the car we were sitting in. I was curious and frightened at the same time, but I did get out of my car and watched this object until it slowly disappeared over the horizon. I have told this story to all my family members but did not have the means or address to send this sighting to anyone for documentation. I am curious if anyone else has had the same type sighting as I had. Being a Vietnam Veteran in the United States Air Force, I can assure you that our government does not have any type of flying craft that could ! perform in the manner that this object did. This object went from traveling at a speed of approximately 1500 MPH to a complete stop in a matter of a second. I am convienced that this object was guided by intelligence, weather by remote control or by occupancy. This is the first time and the last time in my lifetime that I have observed anything of this nature. I am presently 57 years of age and curious to see if similar reports were submitted to your agency. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was returning from a trip to the Colorado River with my boyfriend. It was very late at night, as we waited until it was cooler, to avoid driving during the daytime heat.  We had left Parker on the Calif/Arizona border and were on Hwy 62 going toward Desert Center and I-10. It was midweek and late at night, so there was no traffic at all and very dark night. Coming toward us over the road and from above, came a very fast large white light that swooped down at our car and then straight back up.  It was moving so fast it trailed light as it went. It made no sound and it arched sharply as it went back up as it approached the car.  We both leaned forward over the dash to try to see it as it went up.  It happened so quickly, but we stopped the car immediately and got out. We could see quite a distance around us, but it was already gone in a matter of seconds.  Over the years, I did the usual guessing ""it must have been a top secret government plane, etc""  But as a reasonable person today, I know for a fact that there is nothing today that could move like that, and certainly nothing that many years ago.  I am convinced that the UFO spotted a single light moving in what must have been a vast amount of ground darkness and came down and buzzed us to see what we were.

They were  elongated, triangular and three dimensional. They were utterly silent. The objects did not seem to have any orientation bias in their flight. They tumbled or flew in  any direction  as they tumbled on all axis’s. They seemed to have mass and were subject to momentum because turns appeared to be rounded  arcs instead of right angles. Starts and stops were linier and fluid. I had no way to judge scale but speeds were fast. Perhaps 5000 mph and I assume since there was no sonic booms, they were out of atmosphere.  They gave me the impression of water bugs  skating on the surface tension of water. They all shared the same colors of red, yellow and green and appeared as though they were backlit in some way. They flew back and forth in a small part of the sky  appearing to be separated into two groups and flying through each other’s positions almost like dog fighting but without any fire.

Used a spot light then left. This sighting took place back in 1975-1976. I never reported this as I thought no one would believe me. Recently, I was watching a special UFO show on the Discovery channel and just about fell off my bed when a photo showed a UFO that was EXACTLY like the one my Mother and I saw way back when. Perhaps I will now come forward and hope my experience will help you and those researching UFO's. When my sighting took place, I had been in bed with an illness. I was laying on what my parents called our ""sun porch"" it was a room filled with windows and hanging plants. It was around 11:30 PM as my Father and Mother were watching a Football game on the TV. I'm not sure if this was in October or November but it was definately one of those months. In any event I had been laying in bed and noticed it was getting very light outside. I thought that odd, so I looked out the window to investigate. I was shocked to find hovering over our barn a very large circular object that looked like a full moon. It definately was NOT the moon as the moon was in a different area of the sky. It made NO noise at all, NOTHING! I screamed for my parents to come and look but my Father just laughed and continued watching the game. My Mother on the other hand, did come out to investigate with me. We opened the door and went out side to get a better view. The object was approximately 20-30 feet above our barn and was very bright. The craft had a metalic type appearence in the shape of a full moon and the same brightness. I ventured out to the lawn while my mother stood on the porch watching. I can still remember looking up at this object while standing on the cold,grass. I waved at it and yelled up but it just continued to hover over our barn. I then noticed lights which looked like chaser lights in a strobe like fashion going all around the bottom outside of the craft. It continued strobing for about 5 minutes then suddenly a bright light focused directly onto me. My Mother began yelling for me to get back into the house immediately. I will NEVER forget that night as long as I live! My hair stood up similar to when your wearing stocking feet on a carpet. The light was fixed directly onto me and what ever was operating the craft definately saw me and focused a spot light of some kind directly onto me for about 10 minutes. I felt as if I could not even move it was very weird sensation which is very difficult to even describe. I could hear my Mother yelling for me to get back into the house and suddenly I was able to move again and ran as fast as I could back into the house. The spot light continued to stay in place even after I was back on the porch. With in a few minutes the spot light disappeared and the craft continued to hover above our barn with out making a single sound. Then it suddenly disappeard. It just vanished and was gone. My Mother and I went inside to tell my Father what had happened. He told us we were crazy and wanted to know what we had been drinking. My Mother was a Nurse and worked for a local town Physician. Townsend was a small town and my Mother and I decided not to mention our experience to anyone as we felt no one would believe us, or they would definately make fun of it. Even so, I had a difficult time trying to explain to friends and neighbors why I had a sun burn in the middle of fall when I had not even been outside due to my illness. My Mother and I came to the conclusion that the spot light from the floating object caused the sunburn. We had no other explanation for the redness of my skin. I had gone to bed pale and woke up with a sunburn! Why? I have no clue! Since that time I never forgot that and probably never will. I was NOT taken into the craft or saw aliens or anything like that. I have no idea what my Mother and I saw that night but it definately was NOT military.  When I graduated High school, I went onto spend 2 years in College then dropped out of College and went into the United States Navy. My military training consisted of working in a PatWing where I saw lots of planes. I spoke with several fighter pilots and worked as a radio operator with a TS clearance. Several pilots spoke to me about things they had seen but were unable to discuss. Regardless of that, I've always wanted to know if anyone else had ever seen what my Mother and I saw back in Townsend Mass on that chilly night. I've rarely spoken to anyone about that particular night but feel that someone should know. Hopefully people like you who research this for a living might help to shed some light on the sightings that I and so many others in this World have seen. This took place many years ago. Like my Mother, I also went to Nursing School after I was discharged from the Navy. I only tell you this so you will know I am a reliable witness to what I saw. Perhaps one day we will all have an answer to what is happening in the skies of our World. I know for a fact that our Government and the Government of other Countries keep things from the public which I've never understood why. Thank you for your research and I wish you luck.

Preceeding this, there were reports of cattle mutilation near Gallup.  I personally interviewed at least 20 witnesses.  While minor details of the craft would vary - and a few of the descriptions were of a small red sphere - the basic description/behavior of the main sightings were virtually identical.  I also spent an evening interviewing a family of 5 who spent the previous evening watching the ""silver discs"" hovering over the field behind their house in Clovis.  One of the more interesting episodes was when aircraft were launched near shift change.  I worked swing shift and on Friday nights if aircraft land with avionics problems, swing shift worked over rather than calling in midnight shift from their weekend.  As usual, we had verified sorties by Job Control and there were no scheduled training flights.  When I heard the sound of F-111 afterburners, I ran to the loading dock to see if they were ours (not Nellis or Mountain Home F-111's) and saw the ""CC"" designation on the tail as two Cannon AFB F-111D models launched abreast.  This was the first time I had seen 111's launch in that formation - it was definitely unusual.  Our shop dispatcher immediately called Job Control, upset that our weekend would likely be postponed as we waited for the aircraft to land and likely land with repairs needed.   ((name and rank deleted)) hung up the phone and told us that the launch was no training sortie - it was a ""hot scramble"".  This means the aircraft were launched with live ordinance!!  When we inquired as to why, he said they were tracking bogeys.  Again, I ran out to the loading dock platform and began scanning the skies.  I saw nothing.  I went back into the A-shop waiting area and ((name deleted)) recalled that a buddy of his was the radar operator on duty.  We called the ""radar shack"" and got him on the phone.  He said he had never seen anything like this.  The bogeys would appear and disappear, seemingly without cause and would occasionally move at incredible speeds over and near the base.  We asked him if it could be a radar malfunction.  He said ""negative"" - the radar was in perfect working order and he had run diagnostics.  He also was a seasoned operator and I do not believe it was an error on his part (after all, we DID scramble two $26,000,000 aircraft after something).  I jotted down the phone number to the radar shack - on the off chance....  The two aircraft landed about 90 minutes later and surprisingly, had no repairs that would require us to work over.  I left the shop and went to the Airman's club on base, had a few beers and played some fooseball.  I left for the barracks and arrived in the CQ (charge of quarters) area at around 02:00.  I noted the phone on the desk and decided, what the heck.  I dialed the number to the radar shack and here is my account of what transpired, with my comments:  (ring-ring) VOICE (excited and loud): ""This is Capt.((name deleted)) - IDENTIFY YOURSELF!"" [OK, in the USAF you do not answer a phone that way.  Even Generals do not answer phones that way - it could be the President.  Everyone is taught protocol - ""This is <rank> <name>, ma'am or sir.  How may I help you?""  Also, the odds of a Captain being in the middle of a cow pasture in a small radar building at 02:00 on a Friday night is really slim.]  ME: ""This is ((name and rank deleted)).""  [I almost hung up.  I knew upon hearing his voice I was in trouble.]  VOICE: ""State your business, ((name and rank deleted))!""  ME: ""I was wondering if there were any more bogeys sighted?""  VOICE: ""Who told you there were bogeys sighted?!?""  ME: ""I spoke to the radar operator earlier - we scrambled two aircraft...""  VOICE: ""I don't know what you are talking about - there were no bogeys and no scramble.""  ME: ""I saw them take off...""  VOICE: [Begins to yell and curse - like a sailor!  I mean REALLY bad - very hostile towards me].  Who is your C.O.?  [In the USAF, we don't have a ""C.O."" or Commanding Officers - we have Squadron Commanders but since my father was ((deleted--military))  for ((XX))  yrs., I knew what he meant.  This was my first clue that this guy was fishy.]  ME: ((name deleted)) sir.""  VOICE: ""And what is your serial number?"" [Strike two - no such thing as serial number in the USAF at that time.  It was replaced years earlier by the SSAN - social security account number.  NOBODY called it serial number because that was a throwback to the ""brown shoe days"" of the Army Air Corps - which was very past tense and a history the modern Air Force would just as soon forget.  But again, I knew what he wanted so I complied without questioning the use of terms.  At that point, I knew this guy was not USAF.]  ME: ""((number deleted))""  VOICE: ""What you are talking about never happened.  You are a lying <curse-curse-curse> and I can prove it.  I'll have you  busted - yell-curse-yell-curse.  I will be watching your every move, Airman.  You are not to mention a word of this to anyone, ever.  AM I CLEAR??""  ME: ""Yes sir.""  VOICE: ""We know where you work, we know where you are - if you communicate any of this bullshit story you have concocted, I will make sure you end up in a place worse than Leavenworth.""  [Leavenworth is as bad as it can (legally) get for an errant military person.  I fully took this as a physical threat.  It was not spoken plainly but it was as clear to me as it was to him.]  During the days after this conversation we received an order from the Base Commander, citing USAFReg 111-(?) which I looked up in the base library.  Basically, it says that no information regarding any unidentified flying object can be communicated to anyone under threat of court martial.  I also kept running the conversation with ((name and rank deleted)) over in my mind.  Something was wrong with it all.  I also became upset with his conduct.  As an officer, he stepped over the line - big time.  I began considering bringing him up on charges of conduct unbecoming.  With anger and indignance as emotional bulwarks, I began to search for this ((name and rank deleted)).  Despite an exhaustive search on and off base, there was no such person.  I thought maybe the guy at the radar shack knew him.  When I called for him, I was told by his Sgt. that he had been transferred out.  I told him it was important I get in touch with him and was told he had been sent TDY to destinations unknown.  I detected this Sgt. was ""touchy"" about this situation.  His voice and behavior were showing signs of stress.  When I said that I didn't reacall him mentioned having orders, the Sgt abruptly ended the conversation.  So, who was this ((name and rank deleted))?  I don't know but I suspect he works for a non-military, extra-governmental agency that is directly involved in the supression of the evidence surrounding UFO phenomenon.  I never heard from him nor do I suspect anyone was actually watching me.  Several days passed by and the UFO sightings seemed to diminish in frequency.  One night, after midnight, I was driving back to base from Clovis on Hwy 60.  I noticed some flashing lights over the base that seemed to be hovering.  I figured they are Jolly Greens (Sikorsky HH-3E helicopters) that land there to refuel from time to time.  (BTW, I am an aviation expert and private pilot in addition to fmr. USAF)  As I approach the exit to the base, I notice the lights - 2 sets - are still hovering over the base.  This struck me as curious because they would never hold that long over the base at this time of night.  I begin to wonder if this could be UFOs.  I begin to watch intently, glancing at the road occasionally.  As I move closer, I can make out 2 outlines of disk shapes, with a perimiter of multi-colored lights that appear to be on the very edge of the disks.  They are either moving around the ship or strobing in such a way to give that impression.  The objects also are moving - hovering - moving.  I notice that there seems to be no acceleration curve in their movement.  It is instantaneous, linear ON-OFF.  I make a correllation - the speed the lights appear to be moving 'round the ship increases, then the ship moves - then the lights slow down again.  I see bright blue lights out of the corner of my left eye.  The power lines along the hwy. are exploding (or maybe a transformer) and huge blue balls of arc light are thrown onto the hwy in front of my car.  I reflexively dodge them.  Looking back in the rear view, I notice a small fire is beginning.  I look back at the skies over the base.  Only one ship is left.  Regret letting the other ""get away"" and watch the last ship without averting my gaze for anything.  Yes, I call them ""ships"" because now, I believe that is what they are.)  The lights on this one begin to rotate faster and faster until the multi-colors ""meld"" into a ring then ball of bright white (this happens in like one second or less - multi-color ring > meld to white ring > burst into incredible PURE WHITE ball of light- like no light I've seen) and it streaks past horizon in a split second.  On the flat desert, clear night, 500' altitude (est.) - you figure the speed.  I pull over and open the driver's door of my Buick.  Dazed - absolutely stunned - my world has just been turned on its head.  Everything I know is wrong.  There is also something like a ""force"" that compels me to commit every detail of this evening to memory because one day it will be important.  I don't know why but it will be important one day.  The next Monday, the Clovis newspaper had a small report of an ""unexplained blackout"" on the east side of town that night.  ((name deleted)) Consulting Engineer Fmr.

This event transpired about 30 years ago and I am unsure of the exact date.  It was probably early spring or late autumn of 1976, but I could be off by a year either way.  The temperature was in the low 50's and the leaves were off the trees, which is why I believe the season was early spring or late fall.  My sister had been out at a bowling alley with a friend of hers, and her friend's mother.  In the early evening, but well after sunset, she returned home, and burst in through the front door in a state of excitement.  She announced that they had been followed by a UFO while driving to our home (which at that time was a couple of miles out in the country).  I said, ""gee, I wish I'd seen it"", to which she replied, ""well, you probably still can.  Go look out my window!""  I ran to her bedroom, and looked out the window, which faced the northwest...and I could clearly see the disk.  It was about 65 to 70 feet in diameter, and perhaps 5 to 6 feet thick.  It hovered about 150 feet up.  It was moving very slowly, perhaps only 4 mph, roughly toward the northwest.  The disk had lights on its edge; I saw red, green, blue, and white.  They lit up in sequence, moving from right to left along the edge of the craft.  Because of the timing of the lights, I gained the impression that the lights would have been present all around the disk, but I only saw the edge that was facing me.  Each light would blink on for about a 1/2 second, then off, and its neighbor to the left would blink on, etc.  The night was clear and my view of the craft was quite sharp, but I did not perceive any other features of the craft besides the lights. At no time did I hear any sound from the craft.  The disk continued to recede away from me, toward the northwest.  I watched it for perhaps 5 minutes, and then I left the room.  I have had an acute interest in military aircraft since early childhood, and I know enough about aircraft to realize that this was not an airplane or a jet, and it certainly wasn't a weather balloon.  It was travelling at a rate far below the stall speed of any normal aircraft, hardly greater than the normal walking pace of a human.

In the spring of 1976, in my backyard in Northeast Pennsylvania, I saw a UFO. I was around 13 and had been outside with my brother and five other kids. Something told me to run to the bottom of the yard. This is an old railroad town and the lot my house was on was 80X150.   We had been playing in the middle of the yard so I thought it was strange my brain was telling me to go to the back of the yard. But I listened and walked to the  bottom of the yard and stood there. The other kids said, “What are you doing?” I told them I don’t know and stood there looking around asking myself why was I suppose to walk down here. Then my brain said, ""Look over this way.""  I looked to the left (east) and there I saw half a spot light that seemed to come right out of the mountain top. It was moving in an upward direction, not forward, from a forested area, about 1/4th mile away. This was the beginning of my UFO experience that still disturbs me to this day.  I watched as this light rose slightly above the tree tops and turned into a circle. It then proceeded to move forward in my direction. I called the other kids to come see it. They ran down to where I was and we watched this light slowly come right for us. As it got closer I could see two lights, one on top of the other. I thought it was a helicopter, but couldn’t see any blades or anything beyond these lights. There was no noise at all.  As these lights kept coming right at us, the other kids ran. It appeared that a helicopter was going to land right in our yard. I was the littlest and as I ran up the yard the lights made a turn as if to follow. The other kids were way ahead of me. I could see the blades of grass, this was before dusk.  I made a turn while I was running to go in front of an old garage and to see where the lights went. There above and slightly next to an old oak tree, about 20 feet from the garage, sat a cigar shaped object..  I was stopped in mid run with one foot in front of the other and my arms spread out. I was frozen. I wanted to turn around and see where the other kids went. I couldn’t. I couldn’t talk. I was petrified and curious at the same time. The last I saw or heard of the other kids besides my brother that night was then when I heard, “Do you see that?!” I couldn’t believe how the biggest thing in my yard, and old six foot round oak tree, was dwarfed by this object.   It appeared to be made of   brownish, semi-shiny metal. It was not completely smooth. I could see a mottled pattern all over this thing, like you see on some copper or brass ware. There were two triangular lights on the center bottom, facing away from each other, one red, one yellow. It had to be at least 70 feet long and 40 feet across. I stood frozen, trying to figure out what it was. There was no noise at all. The trees leaves right under this thing didn’t move at all. There was no heat trail behind it. It just was there, not moving at all like a blimp or helicopter would do. I searched for seams and rivets and bolts, there were none. My brain said this is not natural. So I stood there frozen with my mind racing to explain this thing. Our dog made no noise and hid in the garage.  If I had taken about 8 more steps, I would have been directly under this thing.  Then a light opened up from the bottom middle of this object and hit the ground. It was about a 2 feet round, very clean looking spot light. I could see the blades of grass under this thing clearly from the light. This light slowly started to go in a clockwise directional swirl. It was as if it was looking for something. I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up as I realized if the swirl keeps going and getting wider, it will hit me. I was still frozen and had the feeling like they knew I was there.  My eyes were the only thing I could move and I watched this spot light on the ground. This light stopped 1 foot in front of my extended foot. I couldn’t move. It was a round circle of light about 2 feet across. I felt like this thing was getting information from me, like when a dog sniffs for information. I had no clue what this light would do to me. My brain raced with ideas that it could burn me, that little people were going to get me, that army men were going to drop out of this thing on a rope, that this thing was going to drop out the sky and blow up and kill me because I was so close to it  then the light just pulled back.  At this point, I was slightly relieved and could move again. I turned to run up my yard away from this thing and I noticed I could no longer see the blades of grass, it was very dark. I thought this is strange.  I could here my brother up a head of me running too. I watched over my shoulder as this huge object went backwards a tiny bit and then pulled forward. I was afraid it was going to follow me but it turned back east and slowly went back to the exact spot it had came from and went back down below the trees, not over the trees, but down into the trees.  Sometimes, airplanes can look like they are going up when they are coming toward you from a mountainside, I have seen that. This object didn’t appear to come from over the horizon, or on leaving, did it appear to go over the horizon. On both cases, it appeared to come up from and go down into the horizon. I found this strange because there would be nothing but woods at that spot with no clearing.   My brother and I bolted into the house and told my parents what we had seen. I felt like I had walked into a staged scene. My father was sitting in the kitchen with the paper covering his face. My mother was standing in the kitchen wiping her hands with a towel. She was wearing an old apron. She never wore aprons. My father usual sat in the living room with the paper. They did not get excited. My mother slowly went and looked out the window. She said she didn’t see anything. Here were 2 kids, breathing heavy, and scared, and these people didn’t seem upset. They were good parents so to this day, I am perplexed. Maybe my adrenaline was pumped up high and slowing everything down, or maybe it was staged, I don’t know.  I learned quickly after that that no one really believes these stories. So I just learned to stop talking about it. I had seen one silver saucer high in the sky before while with about 10 other kids. I haven’t seen anything like this cigar shaped object. I am now 43 and still can’t answer my own questions concerning this incident.  I am Irish/Indian ancestry, novicane challenged, and quite often like to watch sky in big areas. I do believe this object picked up a bad gene I have for low blood pressure and left me alone because of that. Please add my experience to your data base and leave out my name I guess. Since it’s an older case I didn’t know if you would want it put into the online additions.  I do have other questions.  Why would this thing have to pull back a little bit to move forward?  That sounds like man made directional flight.  What where the small indentations, mottled appearance for? I have never heard these mentioned in a UFO description before?  This incident was one of the first in my life that made me realize, my parents can’t protect me from the world. But I’ve ruled out some type of subconscience trick my mind played on me because there were 7 people who saw this thing. How my parents didn’t see it out of the big kitchen bay window I don’t know. And why my mother was wearing an apron is one of the biggest questions. That was strange. Ironically though, the old oak was the same tree I had been knocked out by when I was about 6, in a bad sledding accident. When I came to, I was on the couch and sweating terribly with my coat still on, and my mother watching. So I estimate I had to be unconscience for at least 20 minutes to be that hot. Odd.    This was definitely a physical object.  But after almost 30 years, I have no clue! When I was in kindergarten to about fourth grade, I would have this recurring dream where a space ship lands in the playground at school. The whole school population is there, teachers and kids. These little men come out and want to talk but no one steps forward. For some reason, I was always the only one who could talk to these little men. They were the same size as me and friendly, not scary. So in this recurring dream, I would have to be the one they talked with. I would walk up by the ship and start talking and then I would wake up.  I could never understand why no one else could talk with them. My present alien dreams involve wars being raged above our heads, where humans are hurt because they are in the way of fighting aliens. Very strange. So I remain clueless after 30 years.  Months ago I observed six red lights from about a distance of 15 miles from an overlook. These lights just seemed to hover around a nuclear power plant cooling tower. They would move a little and then stop.   Then after about 15 minutes they just all formed a line and went west. I’ve never heard of 6 helicopters inspecting a cooling tower at one time have you? I was just glad they didn’t come by me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2006-10-30T00:00:00,,

We began to play with the matches by ""flipping"" the matches back and forth at each other as if in a fiery mock battle. After several ""flips"" had occurred back and forth between us a ""spotlight?"" hit my friend and was actually off-center onto him. I got scared because he ""froze"" like he was in suspended animation or on ""pause"". I began to get Very anxious about all of this and looked upwards for the source of the scary spotlight. It was a ball of light up in the sky,completely quiet,just hovering there. There were no connecting lights or beams between the two but I just ""KNEW"" that the ball of light was the source of the spotlight that froze my best friend. I couldn't believe what was happening to us. I squeezed my eyes together and shook my head very hard in hopes that it would just ""go away"". When I opened them back up--it was gone! I was alittle shocked as I didn't really think that it would really work. But it did! The quiet ball of hovering light was gone! I quickly looked at my friend who was ""coming out of it"" and I was truely shook up. He was fine. I asked him if he ""saw"" the noiseless light in the sky. He said he did. Then I asked him how?-- as he never was able to physically look up and ""see"" anything due to his incapcitation. He said that he didn't know how --but he felt that he did somehow ""see"" it. I on the other hand ""saw"" everything and I didn't like any of it! It just wasn't right. It just wasn't! We used to refer to it off and on as we were growing up -but have now lost touch with one another. Something very wrong happened that night in '76 and I have never stopped thinking about it since. I thought tonight that I would finally just write this all out, in hopes of possibly getting this off my chest and possibly out of my head. As far as I know-nothing other than seeing it, involved me that night. I just hope that what I do remember -is all that truely happened and nothing more.

I had a close encounter with whatever it was maybe a UFO. On a trip back from Wva to Florida, I was returning from seeing my mom in the hospital in WVa., it was late at night probably around 11pm while driving back through Alabama/Tennessee going south on the interstate highway I-65. What occurred was that an extremely bright light that reminded me of a locomotive train light appeared just behind me about 50yds quite suddenly and it followed me at the same pace I was driving around 60 mph, its movement was so strange because it didn’t fluxuate with the contour of the road and I took notice there was no sound as if a helicopter. I wanted to alert my wife who was sleeping beside me in the car but I felt controlled as if in a trance or some hypnotic mind control so I kept my head straight ahead or forced, whatever, I even tried to take my foot off of the accelerator, tried to wake my wife but the only thing I could do was use my eyes to look in the forward direction and glance as well at the rear view mirror from time to time or maybe most of the time to keep track of its movements or was this what I was supposed to do, who knows, last of all I also noticed my palms were sweaty on the steering wheel but I couldn’t take them off to wipe them. It seemed like for hours this occurrence was happening or maybe time was standing still or whatever I don’t really know. I took notice as well, there were no cars in either direction the total time this was occurring, nothing seemed to be happening until this thing was gone and how did it go away well, Poof the light was gone is the only explanation I can come up with. When I was able to make movements with my body the first thing I did was move my head then wipe my hands off then I stopped the car on the side of the road got out and looked all around including the night sky, this caused my wife to wake and you can only imagine what she thought and said when I told her of this occurrence, finally I noticed life and back to the now time zone cars drove past in both di! rections , so tell me did my time stop or what, now doesn’t this event seem strange to you but anyway the years have passed and from time to time I try to take myself back to those memories and ask myself, why me. I have never felt comfortable talking about this subject, even to this day, but it seems like a lot of people are coming forward so why not me. I have had many reoccurring dreams which started from my early teens of flying in some sort of craft and I remember always looking down at the terrain and cities as we were moving and I distinctly remember being asked if I wanted my family to go and I always said no only because either I feared for their safety or maybe I knew it was not my choice to make or maybe I thought I was never going to return again, who knows.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,,

Thus, E=Mc squared is missing volume and geometry and also a chemical and statistacal probability of the Mass as the entity relates to the energy and constant. Also that kinetic energy involves a molecular exchange of particles between two objects whether static or not. IE a human hand may walk by a radio and its signal interupts via the exchange of human boundary (kinetic) and radio /soundwave (kinetic) that the understanding of the Mass/size/Molecules of this energy and its fields surrounds EVERYTHING!.

The night was quiet and clear. Suddenly, my brother startled me by exclaiming "" What the hell is that ?!"". He pointed to the eastern horizon and there just above the water was an oddly shaped RECTANGULAR object (it had 90 degree corners). The amber color object appeared to just hang motionless for about 30-40 seconds. It was tilted at a weird angle. Shortly thereafter, the object started to slowly move in our general direction with the same odd tilt. As it moved towards us, the object moved higher in the sky. It was nearly 90 degrees straight up when it instantly disappeared. Then about 5 seconds later, the amber color craft reappeared but this time it was CIRCULAR or SPHERICALLY shaped. It continued moving due west for a few more seconds when it made a 90 degree left hand turn which brings the object in the sky above our heads. It then began a series of impossible S turns above our heads. We became concerned that this object was too weird and close for comfort so we threw our fishing gear into the truck and started the engine. At this point, the object finished one last S curve when it suddenly accelerated into an incredibly fast and impossible upward corkscrew movement that took it straight up and out of the atmosphere. The corkscrew exit from the atmosphere lasted only 3 to 5 seconds ! Left behind in it's wake, was a glowing corkscrew shaped ion trail in the sky that lasted about 45 seconds. We were completely dumbfounded but assured each other that whatever it was that we saw had defied the laws of physics and human technical knowledge. The entire sighting lasted about 5 minutes. There was no sound whatsoever. The object remained several thousand feet above us but was possibly the size of a large airliner or bigger. Note that there was a report of a similar UFO by a seperate witness about 10 away miles. This sighting was in the vicinity of MacDill AFB over Tampa Bay.

On the way home, we started noting this hole in the sky. As we approached our turn-off, we decided our path was going to take us directly under the object we had been seeing for miles. It was just a couple of miles outside town that we drove almost directly under the object. I pulled onto the shoulder of the road, and we both got out of the car to check it out. I, being a tough guy, picked up a rock and threated to throw it at the object, directly over-head. My friend freaked-out and begged me not to, though I was also afraid and didn't really plan on throwing the rock. We stood there for a minute or two, looking at this black hole in the sky, got back in the car and went home. That is all. I would say the object was 100-150 yds. long.

It is unlike any object that I have ever seen in the sky, it appeared to be low (2 or 3 thousand) but it really is impossible to tell at night.

I do recall the events, which started this extraordinary set of events in motion.  Those images are not something you forget.  I know it was tax season because we were returning from my uncles (he did taxes pretty well) and my father got his taxes done that evening.   We were on our way home, which takes us down county line road, then turn right, then half mile and turn right on to CR173.  We lived about a mile from the turn onto 173.  Well as we were turning, my mother who was also a witness, noticed a bright white oval/almost cylindrical shaped object above what we called (for sake of this report we will call them the X woods) ""X Woods"" (the X's owned the entire chunk of real estate).  Within a matter of seconds, of us all looking to see what my mother had seen, I was thrown backwards with the great acceleration of the car.  When I got back to see what the speed was I remember clearly it was bouncing off the little bar at the end of the speedometer. The speedometer registered 120mph max.  It took us mere seconds, even with a 90 degree left turn into our driveway (driveway is about .5miles in length) this with 3 young kids, and an infant in the front. We were rushed into the house, rushed into our bed cloths, and carted off to bed.  I remember hearing the shotgun being prepped and loaded, and remember for 3 days we didn't go to school, nor were we permitted to play outdoors, and my father set with a loaded double barrel shotgun on the front porch for 3 nights. Beings I was a kid I had no worries, I just did was I was told, and complained about not being able to go outside. This object appeared 9 other times in my life.  I have seen this object up close; I bare scars, burns, illnesses, and other strange marking from events which to this day still occur with frightening regularity. I have been witness to other events outside my purview (happening as I just came in on it or happened to have been present during it).  The object I saw was brilliant, but not so that you couldn't look at it.  It shined what looked like today's laser pens at several locations, however the beam was much larger, and more intense. The beams did not shine directly at us however, but there were several noticeable points of contact.  A tree near our home had been singed, a barn roof had its roofing tar burned to a crisp, and our neighbors lost 2 of their horses due to breaking of a fence, which was also burned (horses later recovered 2 miles from their origin location), the X's recall nothing of the event whatsoever. However their trees were also singed or burned and their driveway showed evidence of burning. This was all quickly forgotten by the X's and the like in the area as this was real rural farm country. From my bedroom window we could see the object thru the tree in the front yard for an additional 15-20 minutes.  This object appeared twice more over the next days.  Each time progressively shorter in stay, the final night was its shortest stay, this time however it was in the field to the south of the woods, and appeared much lower to the ground, 20-30 feet above the empty field.  Later descriptions by my father confirmed this.  He said it just sat there silent.  This time no lights came from the object like it had done the previous 2 nights.  He said it seemingly sat there, which was confirmed by my brother and I who were up way past our bedtime sneaking peaks out the front window.  The last night after hovering for only a few moments it shot straight up, it changed colors from white to orange, then to blue, and was gone. My father went to the site in the early morning of the 4th day, and found absolutely nothing.  No burn marks, singing, or anything out of the ordinary.  However he did notice the air seemed electrically charged and had the smell of ozone. This incident wouldn't be so memorable had it not happened right in front of me.  To this date no other member of my family will discuss this matter.  My father and mother have now passed on, and the remaining witnesses to the event refuse to speak of it. If there were other witnesses to the event none to date have come forward.  I stand alone in this matter.  Basically because it's not something you talk about except around campfires and the like. I have asked my brother and sister who were in the backseat with me if they would care to comment.  Their answers were outright NO COMMENT, so I will leave it at that. My postulations on what this object might have been go from a helicopter, military aircraft, to swamp gas, to UFO, to god knows what. I wouldn't even bring it to your attention had these events not continued in my life.  I have contacted other UFO organizations, and author Bud Hopkins in regards to the many events in my life.  To date only one, ARC (Alternate Realities Conference) in Johnson City Tennessee has any interest in this information.   I wrote to them of my happenings over the entirety of my life. No one else has shown interest other then those I tell around the proverbial campfire,  and even then those stories are soon forgotten.   I can only postulate that the reason my father hit the gas was that he had seen this object sometime before, and was afraid of it.  The shotgun and the porch sitting was another indicator that he was afraid of it.  My mother's response was extremely similar.  They were afraid of whatever it was. I myself at that time had no opinion of it, not till it affected me later in life.   Thanks for your time today.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,41.2484,-83.0835

This is the first time I have ever posted anything like this and, the first time outside of mentioning it to my Mom when I was just a kid the day after it happened.  I saw that someone else had reported this for the same time period, I believe the date that person gave was accurate or it was very close to that date. Regardless of the date though I know the time being around 9-9:30pm is accurate.  I know exactly where the Car Wash is that was referred to. As I write this I have goosebumps just reliving that night. I want to confirm that I had also witnessed the same thing from a different vantage point.  In 1978 I was a Sophomore going to Natick High School, I was 16 years old.  I lived in East Natick, MA. and I would occasionally go in to Natick Town Forest at night and sit on the ridge that overlooked the big field and compose my thoughts and just sort of wonder about life in general. It was usually quiet, peaceful and it was right down the street from my house.  I remember the night that this huge object came flying over head. The object appeared to come from the North East at about the one o'clock position which now makes sense if this person saw it up near the Car Wash (Scrub a Dub) I think was the name. I was sitting on the ridge above and in the middle of the the field facing due West.  If you look at this map on google:   http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Macarthur+Rd.+Natick,+MA+01760&ie=UTF8&z=16&ll=42.296151,-71.331589&spn=0.01111,0.027122&t=h&om=1   you will see a large almost rectangular space, that was the field, the round tower was/is a water tower. The Car Wash was at the corner of Oak St. and Worcester Rd.  Whatever this was it hovered above the field for what felt like approximately five minutes, during that time I felt like I was being communicated to but I had no idea how, why or just what exactly was going on.  I did not feel scared and actually quite the opposite I remember feeling a sense of amazement at whatever this was. After five minutes (it really seemed and felt much, much longer)whatever this was took off straight up. I remember hearing two sonic booms and it was gone. It was a crystal clear night when this happened and although it felt warm at times there were still some very cool breezes and I was wearing a jacket and hat. I also remember there were no clouds in the sky that night I remember that I could see the stars very clear.  Like the person that wrote and posted the other initial observance I also have not been able to erase the memory from my mind and I still continually think about it. It is actually one of the reasons for me finding that persons post in the first place, I googled ""Natick UFO"" because I hoped that by now some other people might have put something out on the web about seeing something so I could confirm that I wasn't just freaking out that night.  I agree, it was spherical (round) in shape and it was as big as a LARGE HOUSE! It had a lot of different colors but I didn't really think of them as ""lights"" the way we think about light bulbs, the colors were more flashing in a circular pattern just underneath the bottom of it. I also agree that it made absolutely NO NOISE except for the two sonic booms that I heard when it finally took off. I also confirm all of the dogs barking in the neighborhood. I also agree with how the previous poster ""sensed"" rather than really saw that it was solid, you could just feel the presence of something solid there and what I was looking at was also very, very smooth, everything got very quiet and then all of a sudden when it was over the field it seemed like every sound ""underneath"" it was being amplified. There was a very strong ""electrical"" almost it seemed vibrational presence (that is really the only way I know how to describe it).  I remember looking at the trees around the field when the object did take off and they had a very eerie almost phosphorescent glow to them.  I guess the thing that really bothered me back then was when I wanted to talk about it then no one else seemed to want to talk about it. I would mention it and get a look like ""yes, i know, but I am not able to say anything about it"" almost like they were scared to talk about or just plain unable to talk about it for some unknown reason. When the previous person mentioned the woman's reaction of ""hmmmm...oh yes"" that is almost exactly how it was, people acknowledged this thing to some degree but were unable to or just did not want to verbalize or be excited about it for any reason, just like being in a trance.  Like the previous poster for the past 25 years I have often wondered just what the heck happened to that night and WHY!  I would also love to be able to talk about this with the person that posted the original just to compare notes, we might be able to answer some questions but more than likely I have this strange feeling that we would be looking for answers that just are not going to be made apparent to us.  I also swear that everything that I have typed is true. I have no reason to hype this. All I know was that I was very glad to see that someone else saw the same thing I did that night in the early spring of ""78"" and I am gratefully to that person for posting their experience.  -M ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

When I was in elementary school, around the 1978-1979 time frame, I was out at recess at school, on the swingset swinging away when I had just stopped swinging and was looking at the sky and the clouds. Almost all of a sudden, this smooth, almost polished silvery object passed silently across the sky. I never pointed towards the sky or called out to anyone (since it was very short, and I felt I would probably be ridiculed to no end) when it happened. It didn't last very long, possibly a minute or so.  There was no portholes or windows on the object, it was completely featureless, with no lights of any sort, and was seemingly completely level during the entire sighting. Never did any acrobatic maneuvers or ""showed off"" or anything like that. Seemingly just darted across the sky just fast enough so I could see and nothing else.  The shape of it, an elongated wedge, is best described as taking a three-sided pyramid and taking one point and stretching it. There's a picture in one of the special issues of UFO Universe (can't recall which one) of a drawing made by a young girl in Israel of her UFO sighting, that had a shape (possibly of the craft itself) that looked just like mine, except hers had lights. The text of the drawing was all done in the Israeli writing, so I am not sure if that's the case.  The object never left a trail, there was no haze about it, no emittance of beams, or anything of the sort. And no noise ever came from the object during the entire sighting. It also remained absolutely level, and performed no acrobatic maneuvers or rose upwards at a very high rate of speed. It also never slowed down, as the speed seemed to be very steady the entire sighting.  No one else talked about it, so I don't know if the other kids saw it or not. I never pointed it out or called anyone's attention to it, preferring to keep it to myself in case I was ridiculed for seeing it. The ""several"" on the witnesses box is only technical, since the other kids were out playing around, but none ever saw the object or said anything about it at the time.  I am also the same one who had the landed UFO sighting with occupant in Gainesville, FL some years later (1990-91 time frame).

My friend and I, who were 14 and 15 years old respectively, were walking northwest on route 130 in Sandwich, Ma. through a residential neighborhood at around 20:30 hours in the evening when we both saw the following elongated triangular object.  The neighborhood was very quiet with no cars passing by on the road. My friend and I were walking somewhere to join other friends to ""hang out"". Though we did at times use alcohol and marijuana at that age, we were both very sober and ""straight"" at the time of this occurrence.  We both looked up when we noticed the very large, silent, slow-moving object passing over our heads above the trees at a slow speed. It was about the size of a football field, shaped like an elongated, irregularly shaped triangle. Its appearance was most like that of a gray rock though it did have the shape I have noted. It was silent and had a bluish glow from the back as if it were emitting some sort of flame or exhaust. This was the only light visible and we only noticed that after it passed us.  When we saw it we were both amazed, exclaiming to each other, ""what the (expletive) is that?!!"" We began to run after it, in the direction it was moving slowly and soundlessly (North by Northwest) until we realized that there was no way we were going to keep up with it.  We then stood watching it fly on, as it continued to head out toward Cape Cod Bay. (though we could not see the water from where we were. It apparently continued on out over Cape Cod Bay.  Amazed at what we had seen, we returned to my house to tell our skeptical families and friends what we had seen. Later, my sister informed me that she had heard on the radio that others had seen the object including, possibly, police officers.  Over the years I have told many people about this experience. I have never doubted the validity of it but have also never been able to explain it or hear from others who have seen it or any similar object.  I would not be considered a person who believes in intelligent beings on other planets or other solar systems and I question the validity of many supposed UFO sightings but I do know that I did see what I have described above.

I have a step father who is almost 70 years old. He has a UFO story that I think needs to be told just in case someone else out there might have been a witness can come forward with more info. He tells this story over and over without any discrepancies in his story. At times he gets excided when he tells it because he relives the experience. He has forgotten the exact time the encounter happened and to the best of his knowledge he thinks it was about Nov. 1978 but is possible could be a few years off.  He happened to be working in a cotton gin in a town called Arvana, Texas just NE of Lamesa, Texas.  He remembers being out one evening in the field driving a truck when off to the horizon coming to him drifting over the trees was a spinning disk object with lights around. He got really spooked and took off fast across the field bouncing around until he got to the cotton gin. He jump out of the truck with the truck still rolling and went in and told his boss and others and they all came out and saw the spinning craft drift to the side of the gin across Hwy 87. People where really spooked at this site and some went back inside.  Also some people in their cars on the hwy stopped and people got out of their cars and where looking at this low spinning disk. It was about 500 Ft high with spinning lights all around...yellow, red, and blue.  Then it slowly began to pull up and then a bright beam of light shot down from the center as it moved up. My step father then said the cotton gin's power and the machinery inside then just died off and shut down. Then the craft pulled up higher and the white beam of light turned off and then it shot upward like a bullet till it was out of sight. The power at the cotton gin then came back on.  He tells me of another story that happened around Odessa and Andrews, Texas.

Let me state that I know this man personally and I can vouch for him that what he saw that night was an experience he will always remember. I really do think this story should be noted online because there where witnesses and just maybe they might see the story and come forward. I really hope you all reconsider your evaluation of this report and post it.  Here is the story again:  I have a step father who is almost 70 years old. He has a UFO story that I think needs to be told just incase someone else out there might have been a witness can come forward with more info. He tells this story over and over without any discrepancies in his story. At times he gets excided when he tells it because he relives the experience. He has forgotten the exact time the encounter happened and to the best of his knowledge he thinks it was about Nov. 1978 but is possible could be a few years off.  He happened to be working in a cotton gin in a town called Arvana, Texas just NE of Lamesa, Texas.  He remembers being out one evening in the field driving a truck when off to the horizon coming to him drifting over the trees was a spinning disk object with lights around. He got really spooked and took off fast across the field bouncing around until he got to the cotton gin. He jump out of the truck with the truck still rolling and went in and told his boss and others and they all came out and saw the spinning craft drift to the side of the gin across Hwy 87. People where really spooked at this site and some went back inside.  Also people in their cars on the hwy stopped and people got out of their cars and where looking at this low spinning disk. It was about 500 Ft high with spinning lights all around...yellow, red, and blue.  Then it slowly began to pull up and then a bright beam of light shot down from the center as it moved up. My step father then said the cotton gin's power and the machinery inside then just died off and shut down. Then the craft pulled up higher and the white beam of light turned off and then it shot upward like a bullet till it was out of sight. The power at the cotton gin then came back on.  He tells me of another story that happened around Odessa and Andrews, Texas. He had heard of a farmer who would see this craft on a regular bases follow the power lines toward the mountains from west Texas toward the New Mexico but his memory of the story and the details are almost gone.  He had heard one farmer saw this craft and reported it and the police came out. They did not believe this farmer. He said even some military folks where there but they really doubted the farmers story.  Just then a rancher driving to his ranch stopped by to see what all the commotion was about. After they told him he said oh yea...he would see the the craft ride above the power lines toward the mountains ( in New Mexico??) all the time.

Around 1979, in warm climate, I was sitting outdoors with 2 friends in college right after dinner.  We did not drink nor do drugs so our vision and minds were not under any influence.  In the dark, all of a sudden, a UFO flew by silently and right above the 2 story dining hall building that we sitting outside of.  It flew by us in a split second.  One friend looked at me shocked in disbelief.  I would not have believed my own eyes, except my friend saw it too.  The other (third) friend never saw nor heard anything and was convinced that the two of us who saw it, had fabricated the story.  That shows you how silent and quick the UFO flew by. The shape was the classic saucer shape.  The size was huge - bigger than a helicopter, but smaller than the building.  The UFO was a dark silver color, and had one string of lights going around it, on the side I saw. The amazing thing is that it was so close and yet so absolutely silent.  I have never seen anything ever again that flies so silently.  I always felt bad about not reporting it, but we didn't know who to report it to.  I was glad to have recently discovered this website and hope this helps by adding one more piece of the big puzzle to solve credible and mysterious UFO citings.

My best recollection is that it was yellowish and the two smaller objects were bluish and reddish. They were clearly too close to be planets or stars. I didn't mention what I was seeing to the driver and 2 other passengers in the back were sleeping. After a few minutes the driver, who had also been watching this event asked me what I thought it was. I acknowledged that I had been watching it and said I really had no idea. We both agreed that it was stationary and close. After a few minutes of watching this together and theorizing what we thought it could be, the bluish and reddish objects simultaneously each moved up, swung up above the yellow object and then appeared to either meet it or enter it. Immediately after this the yellow object headed up at a rate of speed that was stunning and disappeared. It left no trail of light of any kind. The driver and I expressed our amazement to each other, then woke the others to let them know what we had witnessed.

I recall that they spun almost oblong looking in other words not perfectly round.  My brother asked me if I was seeing what he was seeing.  He had stopped the Car on the one way road near our mailbox that was near the Apricot/Walnut orchard trees.  I told him yes, what do you think it is ?  He said I believe they are UFO's and then he told me he was scared.  I did not take my eyes off the orange objects.  I was more frozen then anything out of fear of what we were seeing.  About that time I recall thinking to myself I wonder if anyone else is seeing what we are seeing.  All I saw on the right side in the distance of Hwy 25. was one car going by.  We were all alone on this one way road (McConnell).  About that time my brother asked me what we should do?  I said I don't know.  He said should we call the cops or should we just go home and tell our mom.  I wanted to keep looking at the objects.  But he started to get more scared of what we were seeing.  So we went home and my brother told my mom who was in the Kitchen when we returned home.  To this day that brother is a Director of Engineers in Silicon Valley.  I brought it up to him about three years ago and he was uncomfortable about the subject and was in denial (to himself) of the subject.

She was taking a long time getting ready to go out for the evening so I went outside and laid on the hood of my 1970 Mercury Montego looking up at the evening sky.  There were some stars out, but not excessive.  After awhile I saw what I thought was a shooting star.  The star, however, stopped amazingly suddenly.  I figured that the actual shooting star must have disappeared behind a nighttime cloud and I must be focusing on a different star.  I kept my eye on it anyway.  It quickly became apparent that the star I was focusing on was something strange.  It was gyrating back and forth fairly rapidly.  After approx. 10-15 seconds of gyration the ""star"" shot across the sky just like a shooting star.  As a matter of fact, it looked no different.  It was too high up for me to make out any particular shape.  It was a white light just like all of the other stars.  I was sort of blown away but then I figured I must be tired and imagined what I saw.  Although I knew what I saw, I could not admit it to myself.  If made me sit upright on the hood.  I was going to get up to go tell my girlfriend what I saw when suddenly another shooting star raced across the night time sky just as the first one and stopped in the EXACT SAME PLACE!  Now I knew I was really seeing something very weird.  It also started gyrating, and traveled in a perfect little triangle pattern, stopped for a minute, gyrated, and took off in the same projectile direction as the first, looking just like a shooting star.  One again, I was about to run into the house to tell my girlfriend what I was witnessing.  The adrenaline was flowing and my heart was pounding.  A third came out of the night sky, stopped in the same place, raced around in a circle (not a triangle) and split really fast just like the first two.  I did not wait around to see it there were any more.  Now I wish I did.  I ran into the house and yelled to my girlfriend, Where is a phone book?  I need to call the Hudson police department.  She sort of freaked out and yelled, what's wrong!!?  Still in the shower, she could not come down.  I saw one of those emergency stickers on the side of her phone and called the Hudson police dept., hear pounding out of my chest.  When someone answered and asked if it was an emergency, I got a grip.  I realized that I cannot embarrass myself by reporting UFO sightings.  That would be absurd.  I hung up.  I never reported it.  My girlfriend politely acknowledged what I saw, but I think that was the beginning of the end. Looking through her eyes, I think she thought I was nuts.  This was either on a Friday night or a Saturday night.  When I got to work on Monday I could not help but to confide in a coworker and tell him my story.  He laughed and said, your full of shit, you read the paper.  I asked him what he was talking about.  He said that there were several UFO sightings reported over the weekend in NH.  None were reported in Massachusetts according to my coworker.  The only one I remember him describing to me was a low down light in a field in NH and other low altitude sightings?  It did not sound like what I saw but the same weekend, never the less.  I tried, tonight, 23 years later, to try to substantiate this to my wife by Google'ing a search for New England UFO sightings hoping to find a newspaper article.  I did find this:  7/7/81 Pittsfield Darryl S. Perrault, 18, Carl E. Perrault, his father, and Ann Delsignore, his girlfriend, saw a UFO through binoculars for 45 minutes. When first seen, it shot across the sky like a meteor, then suddenly stopped. Darryl said, ""It was oval-shaped, with red and white flashing lights around the outside like a ring. No way it was a plane or a sattelite- it shot across the sky too fast."" N.E. UFO Newsletter #23 Oct. 1981 p. 18  Seems pretty darn similar.  My search was prompted because myself, my wife and my two daughters watched a UFO special on TV and my wife said, girls, don't believe any of this crap.  I of course encouraged them to keep an open mind.  I am a college educated individual who had nothing to gain by making up a story.  I am speaking the absolute truth.

I just found this site and decided to relay information on what I saw this evening.   Over the years, I have forgotten the exact date, but it's as close as I remember it.   My dad was diagnosed with cancer just a couple of days before this and was a patient at what was then St. Elizabeth's Hospital (I believe on South 70th St.).   My husband and I lived in South Lincoln South of Old Cheney Road between 27th & 40th St.  As we were driving home from the hospital we saw what looked like a monstrous round spaceship.  I actually feel silly putting this into writing, as most everyone I know would write me off a kook.   We spotted it about 5,000 - 8,000 feet up in the air over South Lincoln near 48th St.  It was in the air long enough for us to come home and watch it literally ""hover"" in the air without a single sound (other than a dull hum) from the time we spotted it at approx 48th & O St. to our home.   My husband and I were literally frozen.  We don't remember hearing each other talk, although I know I was speaking.   The next day we asked people at work and found just one person who witnessed the same object hovering in the air that night before.  The best way to describe this object was that it was very similar in size & shape as the ""Mother Ship"" in ""Close Encounters.""   I would swear under oath about this experience.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,40.80091454183267,-96.67416752988048

I was at home in bed with my wife sound asleep. We lived in a cottage in a small village in the county of Cornwall. The cottage was situated down a narrow small access lane on the edge of the village surrounded on three sides by rural farmland. There is no outside lighting and no near light pollution. I gently awoke from sleep for no reason. I usually sleep well totally undisturbed in the quiet and dark location. As I woke, I became aware that their was a light in the room, albeit not too bright. More akin to about half a dozen candels.  As I was becoming more and more awake, I realised this was unusual and decided to turn from lying on my side onto my back, lift my head slightly, and see where the light was coming from. I first thought it must be from the one and only small window. That thought lasted a nano second as I was confronted with the light source only six feet away at the foot of my bed. Thought number 1. What the f""%& hell is that. I obviously could not take my eyes off it as my brain went into explanation overload but no answer was in the data base, and my own sense of reasoning told me this is not happening. But as time went on, just a minute or two, my brain and reasoning started to calm down and I regained control. Let me just say that at no time did I ever feel frightened or threatened, in fact just the opposite. Standing at the bottom of my bed was a creature not of this world. He or she did not move, but just gazed right at me. The eyes did move though, very slightly when the creature appeared to blink very slowly. I was overwhelmed with a feeling of calm and peace which the creature seemed to be transmitting like some sort of telepathy. I then felt it was ok to lift myself up further with my elbows to be more comfortable. Then just as I had done so, my sense of reasoning kicked in. First of all I have got to be sure without any doubt what so ever, that what I am seeing and experiencing is absolutly true, and not a figment of my imagination. Not a dream. Not some trick of light. Not some querk of physics or anything else. These thoughts were very strong because you can not explain what is happening, what you are seeing, but you need too, and quickly. So first thing I had to do is convince myself I was not asleep and dreaming. Well it is the middle of the night and I was in bed! I already knew the answer but I had to check and double check. Yes I pinched myself numerous times, but you do know when you are awake. The creature was still there. Happy with the 'I am awake checks', onto the next thing. Maybe, just maybe its a trick of some light somwhere, I have to remove that doubt as well. So first to the window and, nothing, pitch black as usual. Not even a hint of moonlight which you can get on a clear night with a near full moon. Right, window checked, I need to check the rest of the room now as well. The creature was still there. Gazing, and appearing to smile. The light just eminated from the face. I didn't want to take my eyes of him or her for a second but I had to, to check the rest of the room. I started to the left of me at floor level, and slowly scanned every inch of the floor and lower wall untill I had been round the whole room. I then moved up a couple of feet and repeated the process. I then covered the upper wall, the ceiling, the whole lot. Nothing. I then repeated the process again because my brain was not accepting it somehow. Well I had done everything I could do, to try to explain this thing, now I had to just accept that what I was seeing was very very real, and an alien to this world. The best way I can descibe the creature is from the film ''Close encounter's of the Third kind''The alien that comes out of the space craft towards the end of the film. Similar to what is described today as the classic grey. The one at the end of my bed was just over four feet tall. The head appeared slightly more round than the classic grey. The eyes were large and slanted up, but not black. They were very open as I have already said. The pupils were large and what we describe as the white of the eyes, this was a faint very pale yellow. I could not notice any nose or ears. The lower body and arms were not lit by the light so a desciption was difficult. After I had accepted the truth of what I was experiencing, my main thought now was, nobody will ever believe it. You must have been dreaming. How many had you had last night? I glanced down at my wife to the right of me, sound asleep. She is my only possible witness. I then tried to wake her with gentle movements of my hand against her leg under the covers. My wife eventually started to make noises, turned over, and obviously didn't want to be disturbed. But I persisted. She started to talk without opening her eyes. ''What? What? What is it? I'm tired.'' ''Jo. Jo. Wake up I said'' I gave her leg a good shove and looked down at her, and just as she was about to wake up and open her eyes, the bedroom went dark. I quickly looked round and the creature was gone. How? I don't know. Was he or she beamed down like something out of Star Trek? Maybe. Did I imagine or dream the whole thing? Absolutly One Million Percent No. The whole experience lasted fifteen to twenty minutes approx. Thats the way it happened. And it is firmly etched on my mind and will be untill I die. I sometimes still stare into the dark when I am in bed and expect the creature to return. And when I look up at the night sky I hope he or she will return and tell me of their life in the other world I Know exists, somewhere.

I pointed it out to my friend and we watched it as it moved along. I would estimate the object's altitude at more than thirty miles. We thought it was a satellite. Without warning, the object made an instantaneous right-angle turn and continued in a northerly direction. We watched it until it disappeared over the horizon.  We had no idea what it was, but the instant turn was definitely not somthing that any manmade craft could do. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

WEATHER: no rain ANGLE: The object passed directly above us, parallel to the ground. ALTITUDE: The object flew low to the ground, just above tree line. SIZE: massive, like a football field, seemed to almost fill the sky MATERIAL: (what appeared to be grayish-colored) metal, constructed of plates possibly held on by rivets SHAPE: expansive, elongated hexagon---saw *only* the underside, which was flat LIGHTS: yes; several; whitish; reminiscent of car headlights in shape, but seemed to diffuse near the object body; uncertain if incandescent or luminescent; seemingly sporadic placement; lights were constant (*no* flickering, pulsating; *no* light beams on ground) WINGS: no SOUND: none---*absolutely* silent SPEED: ""slowish"" and steady INTERACTION: no response by object to my yelling/waving arms at object ELECTRICAL/STATIC INTERFERENCE: none INTERNAL RESPONSE OF THIS WITNESS: I felt awe, befuddlement, intense curiosity, assertiveness and lack of fear, followed shortly thereafter (increasing over the hours after the event had ended) by what I now think was a strange lack of awe, befuddlement, and curiosity, as though the moment had become simultaneously perceived as mundane (somehow) and obscured in a mental haze, like the fog of a dream. I didn’t consider the strange emotional/mental after effects, the bizarre amnesiac hangover, until recalling the event years later. *ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Approximate distances from nearby military designations to Overbrook, Kansas: ---Fort Leavenworth, in Leavenworth County, near Leavenworth, KS--85 miles to the Northeast ---Fort Riley, in Geary and Riley Counties, between Junction City and Manhattan, KS--97 miles West/Northwest --- McConnell Air Force Base, in Sedgwick County, near Wichita, KS--145 mile Southwest  Approximate distance from nearby Nuclear power plant: ---Wolf Creek Nuclear Plant in Burlington, KS--49 miles South  Here’s my account of what happened:  There were three of us in the car (each a student or soon to be student at KU). My best friend was driving her car; I was in the front passenger seat, and our friend (also our housemate) was in the back behind the driver's seat. We were driving on rural roads to visit her (friend in backseat) sister and brother-in-law who lived around Overbrook, Kansas. I was looking down while rolling a cigarette when she exclaimed, ""Look!"" For some reason, I immediately looked up and out through my window as my best friend did through the windshield; it seemed as though we just knew where to look. Surprisingly, we did not feel afraid but were filled with awe, and I had the presence of mind to look at the car's clock and record the time, date, and scrawl a rudimentary sketch of the object.  After a few seconds, we stopped the car; we got out and watched the object until it disappeared over the horizon. I waved my arms and yelled to attract attention, but got no noticeable response. When we got back into the car, I went over the basic features of the event, and asked if we each agreed upon the basics of what was witnessed. We were in concordance: 1) we had all seen the craft; 2) we were sober; 3) it was gigantic; 4) it was silent; 5) it was flying slowly and low to the ground. We also agreed that it was wingless, but about a year ago, I spoke with my best friend about that night, and her memory is fuzzy as to whether or not it was. This has me wondering how and to what degree each friend recalls the event.  I wish I had written an unofficial affidavit on the spot, to be signed by we three.  As for myself, I know that memory can degrade over time, but this I remember vividly, because it struck me as such an incredible sight: the craft was WINGLESS.  The object flew above the tree line, though seemingly not too much higher. It is difficult to gauge, being as it was at night, over a basically flat field with few trees, and I am not an expert on altitude. I try to explain it like this: extend your flattened palm between one foot's distance from the tip of your nose to maybe the full extension of your arm (flexibility of distance to account for fallibility of memory); this is about how it seemed, except that the breadth was more expansive. It was LARGE. MASSIVE. Kind of like a flying football field in the sky. It appeared to be constructed of some kind of metal, with a flat bottom, and I remember specifically being amazed that I could see that the bottom was not a singular piece of material, but consisted of plates of metal that looked to be fastened with rivets. It reminded me of a quilt. The underside also had several (don't know how many--more than 10, I would say) lights, which I recall to be similar to regular car headlights, except probably much more powerful, and were puzzling to me because they seemed to have been, figuratively, sprinkled on--their arrangement appeared sporadic, haphazard, disorganized, erratic. Also organic. To my recollection, they were constant, and did not flicker, nor did they graze the ground. I remember only seeing the underside of the object, which we all agreed appeared to be wingless. The shape is difficult to describe, because it doesn't conform to any geometric shape; the closest I've been able to come is to compare it to an expansive, slightly elongated hexagon. But the main feature for us, and what took us aback, was that it was absolutely, positively SILENT. I could not tell the speed at which it traveled, except to say that it did not dart, and stayed on a ""straight"" course over the field at a “slowish,” steady and deliberate pace: imagine a pope's hand waving slowly over a crowd. I wish I had kept track of the time with my watch, but I was absorbed in the sight; however, I think we watched it somewhere from 15 seconds to a minute before it met the horizon line and was beyond our vision. To my recollection, we did not experience any interference with any electrical components of the car or accessories on our person, nor do I remember static on the radio, but knowing my friend, we were probably listening to a CD--don't know if that matters.  After it passed, we got back into the car, and drove to the sister and brother-in-law's house.  I think we did, but am uncertain if we told them about what we had just seen.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,38.7806,-95.5572

Note to Mr. Peter Davenport:  I submitted this old childhood sighting to a UFO site for the first time a few weeks ago, HBCC UFO Research to Mr. Brian Vike.  He asked me to draw a sketch/diagram of it and I did. He then invited me to talk about it on the Jeff Rense program.  They never heard a description like this before. Jeff Rense suggested that I send the report to you, that you have a huge database and could take one look at the diagram and know right away if anyone else ever reported a strange object like this.  I would love to know if anyone else ever has seen something like it.I didn't know how else to write to you except here on the report form. The following is my story.....   Well I saw something strange when I was a little girl so here goes. I was 5/6 years old, I was sitting on the steps of my front porch cracking pecans (wearing a red dress, white sweater and bonnet that tied under my chin- this detail given due to vivid memory). It was windy.I believe it was around March. I looked up and saw this huge brown ball with spikes slowly passing overhead.  It made no sound. No lights but this was in the daytime. As it passed overtop (well,went behind the very top of) a huge pecan tree in a neighbor's yard, I watched for it to come out on the other side of that tree as it should have, but it never did. I then went right inside and told our housekeeper/maid Lillie, yes she was like family, about what I had seen. She told me that it was probably one of those new airplanes from New York because they were always making new things up there in New York. Over the years, I always knew that I had seen this thing, reminding me of like a huge beechnut (or sweet gum) in the sky. Not anything like UFOs as I would come to hear of them, it wasn't shiny or metallic, not saucer like, no lights, no sound.  I decided to check out photos on some of the UFO websites a couple of years ago to see if I could find anything that would remotely resemble what I had seen and was shocked when I did find it, well something so much like it but I really couldn't believe it. What I had always thought of as spikes were being referred to by some other witnesses as 'tentacles'. Along with the photos of it, there was a drawing/diagram indicating how the tentacles lowered downward to land in standing position. So this strange part of it seemed to make more sense. The one I saw appeared to have more of the 'tentacles' than the one in those photographs, also the one I saw appeared to have outline of a door. Those photos were taken in 73,Cocoyoc Mexico. (and my sighting was early 70s also)   After all these years I have done a sketch of my sighting (thanks to suggestion of Brian).When I showed this sketch photo to my mom for her opinion about the old neighborhood part, she said to me....' you know that's probably significant that you are mentioning that there is the field behind the house.' She then said 'you know there were 3 adults at the top of the hill one night that said they saw something hovering over the trees behind our house back there in that field'...... and I'm like 'Mom, you never told me that!, how old was I '? I said, and she said I was probably just a baby.  I thought it was interesting piece of information to receive all these years later. Another thing, it was not until I began drawing that sketch, that it ever occurred to me, that there was a huge fruit field all around the neighborhood, imagine that. I'm attaching a link to the sketch here and hope its acceptable, I'm not sure how else to send it.

I took a look through my binoculars to find that it seemes to be red and green and yellow (maybe blue as well) lights changing colors, rotating, or spinning, it seemed to be in a ball shape. I still wasn't too impressed until it shot East across an enormous expanse of sky in a matter of seconds. It then came back to mid North then just as fast shot to the West and then back again then it made very fast movements straight up and then down and up and down like a bouncing ball. It continued to do these tricks for a long period of time.  I was able to convince my mother to come and look (so I would have proof and another witness) I was sure it would be gone when we returned to the backyard. But it was still there and she was able to witness all of the movements I mentioned before. We were both amazed at the speed and movements. In my opinion at the time and now is that it must have been moving at thousands of miles per hr. To look at it with the naked eye it seemed to be very high in the sky, possibly where an airliner would maintain a steady altitude.  As I say, I know it was a long time ago, but I have never reported to anyone what I saw because I was just happy at the time that I wasn't the only one who saw it. I really didn't know who to call and now I am only reporting it because I still think it is extremely interesting and I found this website through a rerun of the Peter Jennings UFO special.

I am reporting this incident retrospectively to both assist my recollection of events and attempt to gain a better understanding of what my father and I saw several years ago (between spring 1984 and 1986) when I was about 9 years old.  It was late evening after a baseball game between 8 and 9:00 at night.  After several years of denial, my father recently confirmed that he too witnessed the following events.  After leaving the local convenience store heading towards Leonard, I noticed a cylinder like object hovering nearby.  From my perspective, the object appeared to be the size 18-wheeler.  The object was stationary for about 3 minutes and proceeded to parallel us as my father drove towards downtown.  We followed the object for about 10 more minutes towards Leonard.  We continued seeing the object moving slightly faster than we were driving.  About half way between Trenton and Leonard, the object moved south west over an empty field, staying at the same altitude, and rapidly moved upwards vanishing into the night sky.  It did not resemble the traditional UFO flying disk shape.  The object was shaped like a flattened blimp.  My father described it more as an elongated egg.  I remember that the object was red with many lights--red, white, and possibly blue).  The object was glowing with a dim red.  The edges of the area were glowing a darker red.  Additional red lights flashed in a random pattern at the bottom of the object.  The white lights were along the side of the object.  I believe that the blue or green lights also were along the bottom of the object as well.  At the initial sighting when the object was hovering, the object appeared to have a metallic-like texture with at least one horizontal crease.  It's hard to describe, but the object was more than a form of light; it had an odd, wavy, gridded, metal-like texture to it.  The white lights did not appear round, but rather small squares.  In retrospect, the white light may have been the illumination of the horizontal crease.  The lights also did not appear to illuminate the surrounding area.  I could not see any wings or propellers--as would be on a helicopter.  The object did not make any sound and despite how close it was.  It also did not disturb any of the surrounding trees.  A helicopter that was as near as this object was would have been audible and disturbed the branches on the surrounding trees.  Again, these events occurred many years ago and I wish that I had made a more detailed observation of the events at the time.  However, I was a child at the time and only recently had these events confirmed by my father who was reluctant to discuss these events.  It would be incredibly helpful if others could guide me in the research of this event and other events similar to this.

It was probably 75 - 100 yards long. It completely covered all the stars behind it and sat there for maybe 30 seconds hovering above us with NO noise what so ever. It then started moving away from us behind the trees and out of sight.

We weren't quite ready to go home yet or call it day. I was reclined under a nearby tree in the park while my friend sat leaning against the same tree. The park was about 2 miles north/northwest of Kirtland Air Force Base not far from a local trailer park. I looked up through the sparse tree limbs and leaves at the stars in the sky above and it was a fairly clear night with a few sparse and thin clouds above but probably 90-95% clear skies.  Suddenly, I began to hear a faint hum off in the distance and the sound seemed to be coming from in front of us but it was hard to determine exactly where it was coming from. The sound became a bit louder probably no more than 40 or 50 decibels. Finally as the sound seemed to be right over us it rose in level to about 60 to 70 decibels. At that time I noticed that the stars directly above me seemed to disappear one by one. My friend and I became aware that a large dark object was now passing overhead.  The object was jet black, and appeared smooth and was shaped rather like chevron but more rounded at the edges rather than square. In appearance it was almost like balsa wood sanded smooth with a coat of jet black paint applied to it. It was approximately 100 meters (possibly more) in length from wingtip to wingtip. The width was difficult to determine but I would say about 100 ft at its widest point. The height I could not determine. It had a row of lights along the leading edge, dim and white and a similar row of lights along the back edge. On each wing tip it had one large bright white light which seemed to be almost yellow at times. Near its front, it emitted a floodlight like light which shone down in front of it onto the ground covering an area probably as large as two football fields or perhaps more. Except for the constant hum it made no other sound as it glided overhead about 1200 ft. off the ground.  It seemed to climb higher and higher as it travelled on a northwesterly course finally changing its direction to northeast and rising higher and higher as it went. The front floodlight seemed to turn off but the other lights were still visible and it finally disappeared over the Manzano mountain range after about 5 minutes. I would estimate the speed as very slow probably 80-100 mph maybe less as it passed overhead. It seemed to move almost like a blimp but more silently and it was certainly nothing like an airplane or a hot air balloon.

I was taking a walk with a friend in my neighborhood.  I lived in an area where all the houses where on 1 1/2+ acres of mature grounds, i.e. many large tree and bushes.  It was a very clear night and the stars were out in an abundance.  After walking for about 15 minutes we began to focus on the night sky.  When looking up at the sky both myself and my friend saw what we thought was a shooting star.  We both became excited because we both saw it.  Made the wish (don't remember what it was now).  Continuing to look at the sky we both saw another ""shooting star.""  Now we were amazed at our luck.  Then we saw another.  We both looked at each other.  Wow, this was a crazy good night!  Then another shooting star appeared very soon after. I began to realize that each time I saw the ""shooting star"" I felt like a tingling sensation throughout my upper body, head, arms and chest.  It gave me the goosebumps.  I asked my friend if she felt anything.  She described the same thing.  We started to get a little freaked out.  We looked up at the sky again and another ""shooting star"" appeared, as well as the tingling feeling.  We began to theorize that maybe they weren't shooting stars, but a meteor shower, or what if it was extraterrestrials??  Our minds pondered over this possibility for about 15-20 minutes.  Innocently thinking what an interesting discussion to have on such a beautiful night with ""shooting stars"" or just witnessing a meteor shower.  Later we began to focus on another topic other than UFO based.  Normal teenage talk (I was 17 at the time).  All of a sudden a middle-aged man appeared right in front of us.  He was not more than 2 feet away and to this day I can remember exactly how he looked.  He had a receding hairline, wearing a red flannel shirt, jeans, kind of unkempt, and he was walking a short scruffy light-haired dog on a leash.  His hand was fully extended, straight out (no bend in the elbow) and the leash was perfectly straight (no slack) down to the dog.  Because my friend and I did not see the man with dog right in front of us until he was right upon us, we both screamed, jumped, and grabbed each other in sheer fright.  We did not see him until he was right upon us and it scared us to death.  After we calmed down which took us a few seconds, we realized how we looked like total fools by jumping, screaming and grabbing each other right in front of someone.  So we turned around to apologize for being so scared and ""girlish.""  The man and the dog were NOWHERE to be found.  They had vanished.  They weren't in front of us, behind us, to either side of us.  We continued to look for him for a couple of minutes.  He was nowhere.  Then we thought it was very strange that a man who was 2 feet away from us, who must of obviously known he scared the sXXt out of us, didn't ask us if we were okay, or that he was sorry for accidentally scaring us.  In fact, we realized after the fact that he did not make one sound nor do we recall any movement of the man or the dog.  When we thought back about the incident we both remembered that the man was not walking towards us he was STANDING with his dog right in front of us.  Totally still!  My friend and I both swore we would never minimize what happened to us that night.  We knew there may come a day where we would blame it on our imagination, or that there must have been some other explanation other than extraterrestrial related (I  apologize  if I spelled that wrong.).  I am no longer in touch with that friend, but 20 years later I still believe that what happened that night was an encounter with an extraterrestrial being.  I have NO doubt at all.  I just finished watching- Dan Aykroyd:  UFO Unplugged.   He had a similar experience about a vanishing as well.  I got the same chills/tingling when I heard his story.  It just reconfirmed my conviction about what I (and my friend) experienced.  PS- There was no reporting of a meteor shower the next day.  I inquired, watched tv, listened for it on the radio (no computer then so didn't do the internet search), no mention of one.  Also in spring/summer of 1999 I saw a metallic looking balloon hovering near my house very high in the sky.  It hovered for several minutes.  At this time I lived about 20 minutes west of Newark Airport in NJ.  I pointed it out to my husband.  He said it was probably a weather balloon.  He is a non-believer.  Again, watching the Dan Aykroyd movie about UFOs I saw the exact metallic shaped balloon in his footage as well.  After a while it slowly crossed across the sky and disappeared.  I solemnly swear that the above did occur and it is not a hoax or a false report.  The Dan Aykroyd video encouraged me to document my two past UFO/ET experiences.  Hope it helps.  I always wanted to go on record with my experiences/encounter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2006-10-30T00:00:00,40.2909,-74.1652

My story may not be as colourfull as some, but I saw it, and it is true ! My job entailed me to walk between two factory plants, throughout the night. One of the plants, is a secret place, that has been built in a small dip, out of site.This site is involved in the manufacture of some sort of catalyst, that is used for something in the nuclear IND. Anyhow, one winter night while walking to the catalyst plant, I couldnt help but notice what a beutifull clear night it was, and how all the stars were out. After about a 5 min walk, and approaching the crest of the hill that hides the plant, I saw a bright white light. I didnt think anything at all at first, as there is nothing unusual about seeing a white light in the sky at night, IE planes and helicopters ect. But, there was something different about this light and I couldnt figure what it was. I first spotted it when it was maybe, 3 miles away. The light was coming directly at me from a slight angle { 2 o,clock }. Flying at a sort of horizon level to where I was standing. There was something that intreiged me to stop walking when I reached the top of the crest.It was now getting very close. It was a white light of quite high intensity, yet it did not seem to project any sort of beam. I would estimate the light to have been approx 12"" in diameter. It travelled accross the sky at about an estimated guess of about 50 mph ground speed. As it aproached the plant it slowed right down and actualy stopped above the roof of the plant. I would guess this to be about 30 meters above. By this time I had actualy walked about 20 meters down the other side of the crest, which put me approx 75 meters from the light source. Because I was still someway up the crest still, I would guess this put the light source about 10 meters above me, and about 75 meters in front of me at about 1 o,clock. A number of things realy botherd me about what I was seeing ! First off, was the fact that there was no red or green lights, IE plane etc ! Second, I knew that this thing was very close, yet there was no noise. This was about 3am early morning, and you could have heard a pin drop from 20yrds. By this time,Im thinking OK, what have we got that would explain what it is im looking at. Answer, Stealth helicopter. I dont know if such a thing exsists, but it has to be something that can fly slowly and hover and do it in total silence. I then realised, that because it was so close, and the sky was so clear, I should actually be able to see the craft, whatever it was ! I then realised that under close scruttiny, when I looked just above the light I could actually see a star ! This told me that the light must be on the upper part of the craft. So this gave me the idea of sorts of looking to the sides and below this light. I was in dissbelief when I found that I could actualy make out other objects like the trees on the oppossite side of the hill. At the realisation of the fact that this light that I had seen so far travel accross the sky and then to stop almost in throwing distance from me, actually had no body, actually made me a little nerv rattled. I had actualy been watching this thing intentley for about 10 min or so by now, I wasnt 100% convinced that what I was looking at was a UFO at this time. I was certainly wondering if this was the case and if that had been it I would probably never have known ! As I said, as it was winter, it was biteingly cold, and this eventualy won me over to get inside for a warm, leaving the strange light still hoverig above. I took, maybe 3 steps towards it and it shot through the sky in the direction from which it came. There again, was no noise. There was also, seemingly no acceleration as such. It went from zero speed, to what I can only describe as comet type speed. It was gone in a streak of light in about two seconds. It reminded me of a comet I saw when walking home from school as a child. I know we will always have secret technoliges ect but no way, have we gone that far ! I SAW A UFO. That is a fact ! No amount of crap about reflections ect from whoever could ever convince me in the slightist that I didnt see what I saw. If only there wasnt so many idiots in this world, claiming allsorts where ufo,s are concerned, maybe we would know the truth about how many are seen and how often etc. This happened to me about 20 years ago, and I still think about that night quite regualry. This is the first time I have ever recorded this incident. It seems strange even now addmiting this happened. I know now, that they exsist ! Yet I am still reluctant to beleive other peoples stories.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,,

Three fast moving violently churning out of place red and black clouds,New York,NY,1987-06-01T15:00:00,cigar,5 Minutes,"Occurred : 6/1/1987 15:00  (Entered as : 06/01/87 15:00) Reported: 8/12/2006 5:40:26 AM 05:40 Posted: 10/30/2006 Location: New York City (Staten Island), NY Shape: Cigar Duration:5 Minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51645.html,"Three fast moving violently churning out of place red and black clouds The date and time of this occurance is my best guess from memory. I knew what I had taken a close up photo of, but everyone I showed it to back then either laughed, or llooked at me like I was crazy. I put the photos away and for years they just sat in a box. Then I saw the movie Independence Day, and it reminded me of my photos. I had three, but I have lost one which I believe would have been proof positive, since it was traveling away from me and not towards me as they are in the two photos I have and want to send to you.  The location of the photo, was Fox Plaza on Hylan Blvd, near New Dorp Lane in Staten Island. I noticed off in the distance, three very strange looking clouds traveling in a V formation from northeast to southwest. If I were to guess their speed, I would have to say eighty (80) to one hundred (100) miles an hour. As they passed me they were almost directly over Hylan Blvd where the traffice was moving at 45 MPH. They were traveling at least twice as fast as the cars they passed over. As you can see in the photos, the direction from which they came had white and golden clouds, so these three very dark clouds were very out of place. What caught my eye was the violent churning of the clouds. The tops were black, whwile the bottom of each was flaming red. The bottom red part of the cloud was churning up into the middle of the cloud. To best describe it imagine a fuel explosion where a rising cloud of burning vapor is churning up and into itself. From the time I first saw it, and till it disappeared, the violent churning motion was clearly visible.  However, these three clouds never rose but did maintain a constant and steady speed, maintaining their formation.  These clouds did leave a trail which can be seen in the photos as puffy trails of smoke. They made no sound at all as they passed almost directly overhead. As I watched them I had this very erie feeling, and when they passed overhead at about a hundred and fifty feet, the hair on my arms stood up. I am sure that you can determine their speed since there are buildings in the photos. Please look at the puffs left behind, and the white clouds, and then at the UFOs, and how much they changed their shape in a matter of seconds. As I said, the inward churning of these clouds was very violent. I have never had any doubt since I took the photos of what they are. I only wish it were a motion picture camera I had that day so everything would have been recorded in real time instead of snapshots.

Around 16:00 while traveling North on the Florida Turnpike, a few doen cars were (both North & South)were pulled over with emergency blinkers on. I did the same thinking there might have been a auto mishap or something else. I got out of my car and the occupants of the other autos were out of their vehicles. Within moments I noticed they were all looking up in the general direction of an overpass. I looked up and saw a huge object about the same size of cruise boat. It was floating in the air about 500 yards above us not making a sound of any kind with very low levels of light in the background allowing an observation of its shape and size. There were brighter lights coming from what one might call a bridge also shaped in a like way to a large cruise ship. After observing it for 25-30 minutes, I started looking though my car (approx. 2 min) and it was no longer there. Some people left then noticed a couple dozen people looking and pointing towards lights frmo Orlando in which I would approximate to be 20-30 miles In a N.E. direction. I had put my camera back in my car but could tell it was many miles away by then and within a couple minutes it sped (using the term lightly) in the general direction of Cape Kennedy to the east. With in a couple days, the Orlando Sentinal said many reports of this object and the local Air Force said it may have been the Goodyear blimp. This was before the internet and no one had any idea where to report such a U.F.O..  Hopefully someone will read this and give further verification of this sighting.

We decided to go to the store my babysitter her boyfriend and I and were cutting through the grounds I was being a child and rambling on about something when my babysitter said ""Stop for a moment ----- look up.""  And there perched on the large rock in the grounds was a sight I will never forget, a large now it seemed HUGE to me as big as a house but I was 7 and things just seemed big back then it was at least twice the size of the rock this large sphere it was red and orange seemed to swirl with these colors, almost like the sun and was balanced perfectly on this rock.  we stood and stared at it for a few moments and then I asked if I could climb the rock and touch this glowing sphere.  I don't know what possesed my babysitter to say yes but she did and I climbed up this rock as they stood and watched me.  I remember climbing slowly up to this object and when I was within a foot of it reaching out my hand to touch it's side, I got within an inch of it's surface ( I didn't notice any change in temp) I stopped something in my head told me to leave, to go away, so I did I climbed down that rock and told my sitter we had to leave.  So we left and as we walked away I looked over my shoulder and wished it away back to where it came from.  We went to the store and when we came back it was gone. And there was no evidence of it having ever been there.

I was compelled to go over to my window and open the window shades in my bedroom that sits on the second story and faces south east.  When I opened up the window shade I began fixating on a brighter than usual star in the clear night sky.  A moment later the ""star"" light began to move at a moderate pace toward my position. I began to get a little anxious as this was happening.  The circular light kept on getting brighter and larger as it approached.  At this point I was beginning to freak out.  The circular light was then about 500 feet from my window and was incredibly bright and large in shape.  My guess is that it was 100 feet wide by 100 feet tall maybe.  The object at this point was about a 20 feet above me in height. What I remember is that it was taking up most of my field of vision.  At this point I slammed the window shade and ran quickly into my parents room to wake them up.  We went back to the window, my dad did I was too afraid and there was nothing there.  Now this sounds like a bad dream, but I know it was real.  I have had bad dreams though they take place in my bed not standing at a window.

The actual words were, ""Houston this is Discovery, we still have the alien spacecraft on VFR"".  As a reversed speech researcher I was curious to see if the technique of slowing and reversing the recorded transmission would reveal whether or not the message was a hoax (as some claimed), a joke (as NASA claimed), or the simple truth.  In fact, the reversals indicate that not only is the message itself genuine, but the event it is describing was in fact taking place at that very moment.  I've posted the audio so that others can enjoy this unique moment from 17 years ago.  http://ken-welch.com/Friends/Aliens.html  will take you directly to the page where you can listen for yourself.

Unique Characteristic of Sighting: The traffic lights were normally extremely bright on my drive home from work. This particular evening, I noticed the traffic lights were extremely dim.   Description of the sighting: It was a clear night on my way home from work. I had driven this route every night for the last several months. The traffic lights always illuminated up the area and you could see it for a couple miles.

I came to a complete stop just under the lasar so as to put the lasar right outside my driver window. I looked on the ground to see there was a rubber looking 1 inch diameter 3 feet long snake looking thing in the lasar beam. I looked back up and saw the under side of the bowl. It was solid black with the exception for the 3 inch diameter beam shining down. I started to put my hand out to see if I could determine its temperature and immediatley got nervous and turned left and stopped to car. I got out of the car to examine the device more closely from outside my car and it was suddely gone.  I didn't hear any sound. I didn't see it fly away. Of course, after I drove underneath and turned left I was in the car and it was to my back for about 20 seconds. I figured it took off while my back was turned. I didn't experience any loss of time. I didn't experience any abduction. It was simply hanging there and appeared to cause the traffic lights to go dim.  It was only 12 to 15 inches in diameter. It was hanging from the power lines shining a 3 inch diameter beam onto the approximatlely 3 foot snake like object. And when it disappeared, the traffic lights were back to full illumination.

They came towards the me, and one seemed to be holding some strange, ""jewel"" encrusted ""wand"". It was gold, and had red and green ""crystals"" that may have been used to control the device. I think it was this device that was used by the aliens to disrupt my memory of the events.  The next evenining my girlfriend woke me up very late at night, terrified. She said they were back, and she did not want to do with them. Immediately I became aware of a very low frequency ""humm"" which was coming from somewhere outside.  Here is where it gets strange, since it was a waking memory,and I remember it as a waking memory -- My actions that that point on seem bizarre and irrational to me.  I went out onto the porch to see if there was anything.  There was a VERY bright light shining through the trees that separated the space around the cabin from a large overgrow field.  It was at this point I think the aliens, again, used their mind machine, or my own brain was just going into shock over seeing such a bright light shining from this isolated field. We were mile and miles from anything! The cabin we were in had no electricity, no water, and the closest neighbor wwas several miles down a dirt road.  It was like my rational mind kicked in to convince me that what I was seeing was not real. I thought it could be some kids on ATVs, or we were hearing the sound of a far away generator, or that someone was simply playing a joke on us.  From that point on I can't remember much. I don't remember going back to the cabin.  The next day I woke up early in the morning and went out to the field to see if there was anything. Out were the bright light seemed to be emitted from there were eight concentric circles pressed into the grass and mud. These were not like crop circles, but appeared as if something had pressed into the ground. The outer circle was approximately 40ft in diameter. ((name deleted))",2006-10-30T00:00:00,,

I was young and very much into scifi and aliens. I would watch the sky after dinner for hours until my bedtime.  After a while I started getting away from doing so but one night while shooting hoops under the street light near my house, I saw a light.  At first I thought it was a shooting star (which was weird to me because the area where I lived was very bright at night, i had only seen shooting stars at a beach or on the sound where there are no city lights around).  I was facing north watching the object fly horizontal high across the other houses, but yet still far below the majority of the stars in the sky.  It flew west to east as i watched it almost as if it was a train on a track.  Then about 20 seconds into the sighting it started flying northward and continually got smaller and smaller.  I want to stress that it appeared to be flying slowly like a plane does at a high altitude, but this wasn't high and it changed its heading on a dime.   It also appeared to speed up greatly once it made its northernly course.  I want to include that this sighting was long before the Flight 800 tragedy, but i've heard that some people think they could be related.

The light began to move slowly from side to side that suggested it may be a helicopter, only there was no sound. I would guess that the object was a mile from us but moving toward us. It made erratic movements. For example, it would move very fast in one direction, stop suddenly, then move in the opposite direction. The object was very close to us now but it still looked like a bright star. We also heard no sound coming from it. Then suddenly it came to a stop, and sped to the south of us faster than any manmade flying object I've ever seen. Maybe a minute or two after, two fighter jets flew in the direction of the object at top speed. It was the only time we heard any sound. At the time of this incident the naval air base in Weymouth, MA was still oporational and I believe the fighter jets were scrambled from there.

I told him to look up and he dropped all the bags he was carrying when he saw the light.

The story that I am about to tell you is hard to describe.  I have always hesitated in telling this srange story to many people in the past because they might think that I made the whole thing up, or am crazy.  Trust me, this story is very much true and accurate.   What I saw those two late nights back in 1992 etc. still gives me chills up and down my spine even today.  When I was a very young boy in my teens I had two very real and serious UFO close encounters.  They both happened in Kentucky, and were very much real.  There were other witnessess too.  I remember them both well, and they somehow changed my life forever.  They made a UFO believer out of me.   One was a very powerful loud object and light hovering above me and my cousins one day for several minutes.  Were we abducted?  I cannot remember.  The other sighting was of a very large glowing disk with lights that my Grandparent's and I saw in the black night sky up close.  The second sighting happened a few years later.  When I got older I left home and moved away to another city to start a career.  I lived alone in a small one bedroom apartment.  Late one night around midnight I was awakened by a very strong sense that someone, or something, was in my apartment with me.  I looked out into the hallway and I was totally astonished, and scared to death, at what I saw.  In my bedroom at the left end corner of the foot of my bed stood a man, a man in total black ( a shadow like person).  The hallway light was on, and his manly form was unmistakable in my bedroom.  I could definately make out the form of a man with an older 1940's style hat on, and his body outline with an overcoat on too-both completely dark black.  Believe me, this person or thing was really there.  I am a born again Christian, and my honesty is something that I hold in high regard.  I simply could not move-my body was frozen in fear and anxiety.  I quickly glanced outside my bedroom window to see if he was just a reflection from outside of some sort, but their was no reflection.  I opened and closed my eyes many times, and shook my head, to see if I was dreaming.  I shockingly finally realized that I was not.  My heart was beating so fast I could hear it pounding, and I really thought that I was going to have a heart attack.  I could not move, and the man just stood there in complete silence for close to twenty minutes staring at me.  Finally he just somehow vanished in an instant.  It took me an hour or longer to calm down and do a search in my apartment.  The doors were all locked.  About four months later the exact same thing happened again.  I was suddenly awakened, and there at the same location was the same black shadowy man standing at the left end corner of my bed staring at me.  Again I could not move, and was again frozen with fear and anxiety.  My heart was beating again very rapidly too.  This time though I finally managed to ask him who he was, and what did he want.  He just stood there staring at me again for around twenty minutes or so.  Then he just practically vanished again.  Even today I cannot begin to explain who or what the thing was that I saw.  I have heard strange stories of MIB's (Men In Black) visiting people who have had UFO encounters before, but this was crazy. I had never taken them so seriously before.  Now I wonder.  Anyway, the strange and mysterious man in black never came back to my apartment again-thank God.  I hope that you believe my story.  Yes, I know this story sounds crazy, but it really happened exactly the way that I told it to you.  Something happened to me those two frightening nights beyond my understanding.  I DO know for a fact that the UFOs are real!----JG ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Although the light surrounding it resembled the moon's corona, it was clearly oval in shape, and some sort of craft.  I looked forward, as I was driving and there was the moon in front of us. I had to stop. I turned around, drove toward it slowly, as we approached a stop sign. Here is the corny part; just past the stop sign, there was a mid-80's sedan, stopped in the middle of the road, the interior lights on, the headlight on[I think], all four doors open, and unoccupied, apparantly.  We continued to stare at what we now clearly identified as the ""typical"" saucer shaped UFO, somewhat concerned with the empty car in front of us. The craft was extremely still, and although it's appearance was not vivid, it was well defined; that is to say, it could have been a hoax, but it was the most elaborate hoax ever.  We looked on uttering silent profanities for roughly 10 minutes, maybe 10 seconds, maybe an hour, who know's.  Then, a streak of light.

I remember turning on my video camara but it discharge,i remember charging it for three hours before we left the house. My father began taking pictures with a professional camara. Suddenlly the object turn off its light. I believe that my fathers flash with the camera got there attention. Suddenly out of no where my uncle yells out loud that there was an object right on top of us.As i looked up i saw with my very eyes a disklike shape object with three windows in the middle of the craft and around the object it had ligths,the colors changed from red to orange. It had No sound what so ever,and it was approximally a thousand feet on of us. The object stood there appr.ten seconds and it disapeared. Suddenly a beam of light aroused from the field and saw that a craft was moving toward us.This object was fliying closer to us. We panic and got inside the car and tried to run away from it. But as the car was running i could see the silver object following us. To head back to the town we had to go up a hill and down towards the nearest town. On top of the hill i looked back and saw that it was fliying on top of the town. Then we reached to Metepec all scared but i looked up and it was not there anymore. I have also seen Aliens in the same spot back in 1997. They look similar to the Greys only that they are protected with a red aurora or some kind of electric protector. I believe that they are doing some kind of study inside the volcano. Or probably concentrading more on its magnetism. People in Metepec have reported a number of lost dogs in 1993. Like i wrote the U.F.O had no sound,it has three windows in the middle of the craft and it has lights all around the object. The second object or it could had been the same object flashed a huge beem of white ligth up to the sky,and saw that the object was silver. I have also seen red balls of light fliying across the hills of a small town called Piaxtla.Two hour away from the city of Puebla.

Don't remember the exact time but it was early twilight so probably between 6 and 6:30 PM(?),  the sun was below the horizon, no glare remaining, just a gradated deepening evening blue.  We were heading west on Ponce De Leon toward Midtown and I was a passenger in the car, front seat.  I was not on any medication, nor had I had any alcohol.   A bright white light appearing to hover near a Midtown skyscraper eventually caught my attention, about a mile distant.  Don't remember the light's  approximate elevation as far as stories go but it was to the right (north) of the skyscraper, several stories lower than the skyscraper's height but above any other buildings in the vicinity.  We were on a hill going toward Midtown and I was looking pretty much straight ahead at the light, not having to peer up into the sky.  I watched the light without thinking anything about it, then began to think about it and imagined it was the bright beam of a helicopter.  As I watched it struck me that it wasn't appearing to move.  By now I was curious because you expect the beam of a helicopter to waver as the vehicle moves and to grow brighter as it progresses, and imagining it a helicopter I had begun to watch for this as it hadn't happened yet.  I was still expecting it to be a helicopter, and so had  mentioned nothing to the driver  about it, when suddenly the light ascended at an incredible rate of speed into the sky, to the north, at about a 45 to 55 degree angle. Before you could snap your fingers it was gone, that fast, from what seemed an absolutely stationary position in the sky.  No trail.  No sound. There appeared to be no acceleration.    The amount of time I spent watching the light before it zipped off may have been as little as 30 seconds, probably no longer than a minute.

We were traveling about 55 MPH.  My nephew, an aeronautical engineer, was driving my car so I could watch for elk on the highway, being the spring of the year.   All of a sudden the highway in front of us lit up for a distance of approximately a quarter to half a mile in front of us.  The light was a very soft misty light and for some reason it didn't alarm us, it just appeared.   Being in the passanger seat, I bent up over the dashboard to see what was above us.  What I saw directly above our car was a huge soft, round light about 35-50 ft. in diameter.  As I looked closely, I could see greyish metal surrounding the light but could discern no definite shape.   Then, looking directly ahead and just above the car, I counted seven of these round lights in a row down the highway.   As I was peering directly up above the car, the ufo suddenly made an elegant curving motion just above our car and in a fraction of a second was gone.  As it made the turn, we could see the individual lights bending as the craft went skyward at thousands of miles per hour.   The next moment I could see it far off in the sky with the lights in a row but the object now looked about two inches long and then it disappeared.  The craft made no noise. I asked my nephew not to discuss what we saw until we arrived home and wrote everything down, including drawings.  The only discrepancy between us was I thought the craft was about 100 ft. above the car and he thought it was only about 75 ft. above. The next morning, we went to the local Pagosa Springs airport and spoke with the airport manager.  He said his neighbor  had seen a similar huge craft hovering over his house that night.   After having time to consider everything, we realized the ufo had to be traveling the same speed as our car as we were driving as it didn't seem to be moving at all.  The one end of the craft was directly above the car.   We reported it to the local Sheriff but he didn't seem interested and made no notes.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,37.3442,-107.0802

It was a beautiful summer night, no clouds, no wind, and no people awake, in this (little) suburbs of Montreal. At a moment, we were just kiding and laughing, you know, like any young people can do, and suddendly, my friend said to look up in the sky the strange thing.  It was dark-brown, like a big rock (shape of an egg maybe), with rough appearence, you see? It was completely quiet, and was floating at about 150 meters from the ground. It's very particular, the way it was going : I don't think that there was any engine in the object, the propulsion was very weird, like if it was just gently glide, but fast!  I don't know how to explain it in another way (in french it would be easier). It was going like something floating firmly in a particular way (to the west).  I saw it for 5-10 seconds (don't know exactly), it finaly disappeared.  Not disappear by gogin further. Disappear like ""pop"", one second we see it, one other second we don't see it.  It was night and there was no lights on the object, so maybe I missed something, but that is what I remember.  I think the object made 100 meters by the moment we observe it before it disappeared. It was going from east to west. Just over us. We all see it (but one of us, now, think it was birds).  What I remember the most about this event, is the strange feeling of ""something weird"", you know.  It wasn't a birds flew, because at the end, those should go scatter, not disappear.

I wrote him earlier this year asking what he recalled about the incident… b/c I have been coming across more tv specials regarding ufo and crop circle phenomenon.  The photo was taken from the spot where we camped.  I had been walking/hunting this area for many years and knew miles of territory around this from many angles.  I’ve camped here and close by many times.  I’ve never had any previous encounter and have not had any since…. But what my son and I saw that night was truly different than anything we’ve heard, read or seen on tv.  The night had a half moon on the opposite side of the sky, which gave some cast on the outlines of the hills even though it was dark – meaning no city lights were affecting us…. It was about 9pm. The exact date is not in my recollection but is recorded in my original notes of 12 yrs ago, however it was late June/early July of 1994, we were near Ink-O-Pah California, close to Table Mtn.  I was 42, my son was 16.  We were finished with dinner and were shooting fireworks, rifles, pistols and shotguns… I had gone to the back of my Chevy Blazer to get something when my son said he saw a fire in the distance and thought someone was coming towards us. I turned and saw a light in the distance where there should only be sky… it looked like a large campfire and it looked to be way out in the distance and the light was flickering. There was a hill about 1/8 mi from us on the right, with another hill about 1/8 mi more on the left, these forming a V. The ‘campfire’ was off center … while we looked at it another fire come on to the right but the same level, then after 15 sec another come on off-center of them but lower – no symmetry…. They did not start small and become larger, they were big fires immediately and all 3 the same size. I got out my 12x power binoculars and looked at them…. They were not campfires, instead they were large rectangular windows with yellow light coming from them, the heat of the desert was plainly distorting in the foreground [which gave them the ‘campfire’ look in the distance] but these windows were just beyond the furthest hill [approx ¼ mi]. We only had a few minutes at these 3 when one went out, then another, then 4 came on – leaving 3 on one plane and 2 on a lower plane, again no symmetry.  In my binoculars there was enough light from the 5 windows that I clearly saw a horizontal deck under the lower 2 lights … the openings looked to be about 3’ x 12’ and the deck about 5’ wide. After about 1 min I gave the binoculars to my son and got my rifle out which also had a 12x power scope.  Just then the lights began to go off, then 20 seconds later come on … in different patterns 3/2, 2/2, 2/3, ½, etc, etc for the next 10+ minutes as we watched. We felt no fear, just curiously watching as the lights went on and off. Then they went to all 5 on…. and one by one went out. I figure the distance the lights spanned was about 100 yds, left to right, while the lights looked like they were between the peaks, they were behind them a distance that I can only guess at , at least 1/8 mile if not more. We waited to see what happened next … After approx 2 min a tall white light looking like a pole lit up on the closest hill on the right.  There is a smaller peak formed by large boulder with another boulder below on to it’s left which nearly outlined the downhill slope of the hill in the background…. The light was on top of the lower boulder, it’s light illuminating both boulders and yet shedding light on the hill in the background too …. It looked to be 8’ or 10’ tall with quite a glow around it, there was no form other than a long tall pole of a light, I would guess 6” wide in comparison/proportion to the height of the pole. After a couple minutes looking at it, it went out.  After about 1 minute it came back on in the same spot and 10 seconds after that a red pole light popped on, to it’s right and lower down the rocks … it looked to be approx 6’ – 8’ tall.  It’s glow was bright and we could see the rocks around it, but it was a bright red. These lights went on and off only a couple of times over about a 4-5 min period, then went off – white being the last one. We looked intently to see if they or something was moving towards us or coming closer to us. After approx 2 min several of the ‘campfire’ lights came on again, stayed for about 2 min, then all went out at the same time.  We watched and waited and then began to make ourselves busy while talking about everything….  nothing ever happened the rest of that night. We stayed up till about 11pm, then went to sleep in the bed of the Blazer with the tail gate open.  Neither of us had any awakenings, encounters, aliens, kidnappings or nothing … we woke up fine and have never had any dreams or nightmares or anything beyond our mental recollections of what we saw that night. Next Day: We walked to the closest hill and searched all over for any signs of marks, prints, burns, disturbances … and found nothing. We then walked down to the base of the hill in the background, finding nothing we went back to the Blazer, drove to the other side where I knew of a dirt road coming close to the hill, then walked up to the top of the hill, again searching for any signs of something or someone having been there.  I looked for any fake rocks too, as in the movies they use foam rocks.  We looked for anything moveable, any place that a pole might come out of the ground that could have lights on it, we used our imagination to try to find anything… but there were only animal marks, prints, etc – just natural traffic in the dirt.  I returned the next weekend with my camera for the picture I’ll attach or send along. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2006-10-30T00:00:00,,

As I slowed to stop before turning onto the road, I looked in my rearview mirror and saw something flying very quickly in the distance--it would have been like I was looking over my right shoulder.  At first, the sun glinting on the object made it catch my eye.  At first I thought it was a ballon and was catching the sun funny, but then it began to get closer, and I could see it was too large and moving too fast.  However, it was too small to be a plane, and too low and too fast.  The object flew over and above the trees and to the right.  By this time, I had turned onto the road, but I had slowed down to look, and two other cars had slowed also--so it wasn't just me.

My Grandama lives in Delaware County Ohio.  It is in the country.  One night her neighbor from 1/2 mile down the road called her(around 9 pm)and told her that her husband had been in the field on a tractor working and he saw some UFO's heading towards my Grandma's house.  At this point, my Grandma grabbed her VHS cordcam and went outside. By this time, her neighbor came down.  They then watch and converse about the happenings.  I will dictate what takes place in the video:  My Grandma and neighbor says,""  they almost look like searchlights, but why would they come together like that"".  At this time in the video, you see four tear-shaped objects, glowing a soft yellow, coming together to make one bright object with many rays coming from it, however you can still distinguish each object.  Then they break apart and head to different parts of the sky.  At this point, beams of the same color shoot down into the back woods.  I have periodically look at this video.  My brother and I used to watch it frame by frame.  The objects move at incredible speeds.  They wil disapear and reapear in a different spot, and THEN you will see the streak/travel path left behind!  Also, at one point you see the fifth object which appears in the upper right corner of the video.  It is long and rectangle with very soft edges, not luminecent like the others.  You can also see a row of windows that are darker than the rest of the ship.  At that time, I was 14.  My brother and I began to research it. We found pictures of the likeness of our ships in the ""Gulf Breeze Sightings"".  They even had a pic of the rectangle ship we saw.  They called it a ""cigar-shaped"" ship, and go on to call it the ""mothership"".  Anyways, I figured I would tell one last person.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,,

Well, I was on my way, taking her to school early one morning not far from where we live and i had noticed she was being exceptionally quiet and staring intently out of the front windshield of my blazer.  I said , honey, what are you looking at, and she said, ""mommy, theres a baton in the sky"".  I said ""what"" and looked in the direction that had her attention-and I saw this -perfect cigar shaped metallic looking object just above tree top level.  I immediatedly pulled my truck over and got out.  I was mesmerized. I probably just stood there a couple of minutes just watching this object-and if i had to estimate, it was probably the size of a large automobile more pewter in color than silver.  I never saw it move. I heard absolutely no sound, no lights, not anything, other than the fact that it was hovering just above the trees, and was extrememly close to us.  After watching it in awe, I suddenly got scared and jumped back in my vehicle and left-when I looked back I could no klonger see the object.  This is my first, only, and last time that I will report this sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2006-10-30T00:00:00,,

The object was not a thin disc, but appeared to be 2-3 stories in height.  It made no sound and its speed was too slow to be an airplane.  It moved about 5 mph.  From the position I was in it was moving in a North East direction toward the college.  The object had blue, red, and white lights across it flashing and rotating.  I can remember watching them mesmerized at the fact that it was coming towards me.  I never lost eye contact with it, but I did lose time.  While I was watching it move closer, I did not notice that a tow truck driver had pulled up next to my unit.  He banged on his driver side door to get my attention.  He wanted to know a certain apartment complex.  After answering his question, which only took a minute, I looked back at the tree lines and saw that the object had disappeared.

Probably about 100-200 feet up. It was about as big as a football field. It was a boomerang shape and there were two whit lights on each point, and a large red and white light in the center/front. The metal looked brownish, and you could see it all pieced together, like where it was welded together or something.There was NO sound at all.

It was a very clear, star-lit night, and we were all clear-headed (none of us use alcohol or drugs). Over the space of an hour or so, we observed one or more single points of white light, about the same size and brightness as a dim star or a man-made satelite, moving randomly in a small area of the sky, almost directly overhead, high above the earth. I would have guessed that they were man-made satelites, but they didn't travel in a continuous straight line across the sky, and they moved slower than satelites.  I would also have guessed that they were extremely high-flying aircraft, but their movements were not like aircraft--they would move slowly in a straight line for a while, then make turns that were too sudden for an aircraft, sometimes at angles close to 90 degrees. I don't recall seeing more than one in motion at a time.  If we stared at the area of the sky in which these objects were appearing, it would appear as though one of the stars would begin to move, and then for the next several minues, we would watch it move randomly as I described above. I never reported this, but I talk about it with my friends from time to time. We ask one another, as we did that night, ""Did I really see that?"" and the answer is, ""Yes.""

My buddy yelled down to them ""what are you looking at you perverts"".  They looked up and shouted back ""wholly shit....do you see it too?"".   They were both almost hysterical. One of the men had a small eye piece he was looking through.  He tossed it up to us so we could see for ourselves.  There was a boomerang shaped craft way up in the sky.  It remained motionless as white puffy clouds were passing underneath. You could barely see it without the eyepiece. Then one of the guys said ""look, there's more"".  Sure enough we could see 2 then 3....I counted 4 total.  All the same shape hovering close to one another.  They all seemed to have the same segmented color scheme. A dark band followed by a light color band followed by another dark band.  Kind of like a bumble bee.  We all went out onto the street and continued watching the craft. No one had a camera so we began stopping people on the street and pointing out the objects to them. I guess this was an attempt to prove to ourselves we weren't crazy or seeing things.   After a while of watching & telling people, it was weird, there was nothing else we could do.  Eventually we went back up stairs and I continued looking back up in the sky to see if they were still hovering. I looked up the last time and they were gone.  We never saw them zoom off...they just disappeared.  I found this site while surfing the new google video search engine.

The second event were flares dropped over the Gila mountains.  They acted exactly like flaires and it is my opinion that they were dropped to confuse everyone from the first event.

Looked up from my desk through the window then open and then saw 2 bright white lights flyby away from me.So my line of sight of them was from the top of my window frame and saw them fly over and away from my house down to the valley and lost sight of them as they flew over some trees and dissappeared behind them. They were pure white lights which sparkled leaving a small tail of light behind them. They were the size of roughly a Soccer ball maybe silghtly bigger. They flew together about 2 meters apart fairly fast and smooth in motion changing altitude in relation to the ground.As they passed over I remember there was no sound produced by them. No sound of air or an engine.Its as if the air did not make any resistance to these objects passing through it at that high velocity.  During this year 1997 I saw these same 2 objects once in the late afternoon as I was going home. I was comming up along the valley in the car and glanced at the skyline over the trees towards my house and saw these same 2 lights appear high in the sky and drop vertically down above the tree line and disappear as if they switched off there lights. The distance from me to the treeline where I saw the lights drop out of the sky and then disaapear was roughly 500meters.It must have lasted 2 seconds.They moved very fast and hovered over the tree line for maybr 0.5seconds before I lost sight of them. I had a close up of the same light but this time it was just one on its own.And I saw it as I was in my bedroom looking out the window to one of the trees in my garden about 8 meters away and saw this light fly by 4 meters from me and it made absoluetly no noise what so ever.As if it nothing passed by.It passed me at birds speed and was the size of a football again the same pattern of bright sparkling white light with a tail. It did not have any effect on the nosiey birds in the tree nor my 6  gaurd dogs whoose kennels lie below the tree. It was amazing.I never told anyone I know and kept it to me all these years because I knew no one would belive. I have never seen these lights again since and I have also spent little time in Kenya since but I will never be able to forget this.Surprisingly never did I feel threatened during these encounters or shocked but felt more peacefull then normal.I find that very strange as a natural reaction would be to be startled.I hope this account helps your records and may prove useful to yourselves.

We lived on 16th street near where 16th st. intersected Morgan Street and about half a mile from Cole Park on the bay. One day my friend's cousin had visited him during the afternoon and was going to stay the night. So we decided to spend the rest of the day hanging out and when nightfall approached. We decided to show him our late night hang out spot which was an abandoned house next to my friend's house. The abandoned house had a 2nd story patio that could be reached by stairs and from there we could easily jump on the roof. We would hang out on the rooftop there late at night since we did not have school and it was okay with our parents. We would look up at the stars and talk about anything. We'll that night around 1:00am, we decided to go to our hang out spot on the abandoned house rooftop. The rooftop was in the shape of an L and it was not flat but slanted on each side. I was sitting down on the long side of the L shaped roof facing to the North . While my friend and his cousin sat on the short side of the L shaped roof facing West. We were there for about an hour talking about something when all of a sudden I noticed something stranged. As I was looking at my friends I noticed a bright white light appear around us. I was shocked since it was 1:00am and there was no moon visible in the night sky. As I looked up to see the source of this light. I saw a white bright glowing object hovering about 15ft in the air near the end of the of the L shaped roof near my friends and about the size of a small car. This object did not have propellers, wings, or any insignia that may have confirmed it was a commercial or military craft. All of sudden it ceased its hovering position and began to move toward us. Afraid and shocked at what I was seeing I immediatly got up and made a mad dash to the patio and my friends followed suit. As we made our frantic run from the object I looked back at the ob! ject onc e I reached the ground but it was gone. As we reached my friend's house. We were all shivering from fear and we could not come to a conclusion to what we saw. Since then we have kept the incident to ourselves for about 9 years.  A while back I visited my friend, since we have all moved from our original neighborhood, to finally bring this incident to light for us. He was relunctant and wants to forget the incident but from his viewpoint he agreed to settle the matter. He remembers seeing a scared reaction on my face and when he looked to see what was the matter. He said the object was approaching and instantly he and his cousin ran as fast as they could. While on the patio he turned to see the object. He said he saw the object zig zagging back and forth into the sky then disappearing leaving a metallic streak. A while back I saw the documentary about UFO phenomena with Peter Jennings on the National Geographic Channel and heard about the UFO Center. I felt I should tell the center of my experience and maybe someone else around that area may have reported the same object.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,27.717500161812296,-97.40525129449838

Every one of my neighbors – approximately 200 people –  stood out on the street looking skyward as the disk shaped craft hovered vertically south of my house.  The disk had a intense mirrorlike reflective top half and dense black appearance on the bottom half.  The unidentified craft hovered motionless here for two hours in broad daylight.  I got a excellent look at the disk with 9x binoculars.  Every now and then, a brilliant ruby red light would shoot down to the earth from the craft as if it was aimed a few blocks from me.  During the two hour period, not one car drove past my location, either on Eagle Rock Blvd. or any side street. At one point, I could see a small window open in the side of the craft.  The image was distant, but I could see something move inside the disk before the window seamlessly closed.  The craft hovered here until 11am and then began to slowly drift south.  After a few minutes the unidentified disk tilted on its axis, at a forty-five degree angle, and then disappeared into a point of light. The disk was seen at least ten blocks in every direction which means over 2000 people saw this strange unidentified object.

I set up a stick as reffernce point and layed on sled seat to stay still/steady and watched as this object did loops and figure 8,jturns always very fast and ending in same spot then it would get brighter red and blue pulses.

We were driving our car north/west-bound on Miller Road on our way to dinner.  It was 5:30-6:00 on a sunny day.  There were cars ahead of and behind us, but not what I'd call heavy traffic.  Miller Road is very hilly, and you find yourself either staring into the sky or at the ground as you go up and down the hills.  We were getting some glare on the windshield from the late afternoon sun as we crested the hills.  As we reached the top of one hill, a brilliant ball of light appeared for a second or two in front of us and off to the left.  It seemed to hover breifly, and then was gone.  I muttered ""What the hell was that?"" to no one in particular - my wife and two older children heard this.  I turned to my older daughter (11 at the time) who was sitting in the front passenger seat, and as if on cue she said ""I don't know Dad"".   Iasked her what she saw, and she again said she didn't know - but added ""It looked like a big ball of light"".  My wife, 8 y.o. son and 3 y.o. daughter were all in the back seat,  and didn't see anything - at least they didn't make any comment.  About this time, a car had caught up with us, and honked at me to go.  I had come to a complete stop in the middle of the road!  None of the other cars I could see gave any indication that they had seen anything - they all just kept driving.  I blew this incident off at the time, and my daughter and I never talked bout it afterwards.  However it never seemed right, and it still bothers me.  I am an engineer by vocation, and can rationalize almost everything.  However this is something I have never been able to explain to myself.

You state that you were driving to the northwest, approximately, and that the flash of light was to your left, would that ot have been in the western sky.  I believe you state that the object would have to have been east of the road.  I am confused by that apparent contradiction.  Is there something I don't understand about the event? Thanks, again, for the interesting report!  Do you think that you might be able to pin down the precise date of the incident, if you were to think about it for a while? Also, may I pass your report along to some skilled UFO investigators in Missouri?  I think they would like to know about the event.

We had left Rapid City that night, and when we got to Wall South Dakota, a bad storm had hit the area. We were just coming out of storm when we had just passed thru Midland. I was driving and the rest of my family was sleeping, when a orange ball of light had come down from the sky and , just before hitting the ground, it blew up. Many small white lights seem to leave in every direction. I woke my wife and told her I had just seen my first fireball lightning. I then noticed a very bright flashing strobe light on side of hill. I showed my wife. It just happened that the highway turned to where it was on the side of the hill. When I got to the top of the hill,it was about 100ft off highway. I pulled up next to it and told my wife I was going to walk over to it. She said no but I said I wanted to know what it was. I got out of my van and walked accross highway,into ditch where it was flashing. I tried to look at it but each time it flashed it blinded me. Halfway there I noticed another to my right. I called back to my wife, who was standing next to our van, look there are two of them. She yelled back ""no, thats the same one, it just moved"". I then thought to myself that anything that can move that fast is probally nothing to mess with. My wife was yelling lets get out of here so I went back to van and told my wife to wake up my oldest son. I got in and preceeded down highway, when I noticed it was still beside our van. My wife says speed up and out run it.I was going over 100 and it still was still beside us. About 5 minutes later it seemed to fall back about a mile. I said I think we lost it, just then there it was beside us again. Down the road a ways the highway turns towards Pierre, we made the turn and noticed that the light didn't follow us in that direction. About 10 miles down that highway we stopped to check our kids. Everything seemed to be OK. Maybe we just imagined this, my wife said. I looked down the highway back in the direction that we came and saw the light in the distance.! No we d idn't imagine this, I said as I pointed back at it. We both got back in the van and left quickly. We couldn't get a look at it because it was to bright to look at, it lit up the surrounding area, as if it was day. We had a long nervous ride back to Jamestown that night.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,,

I got up and looked out the windows and the window to the front door. I did not saw only darkness outside. The tone was reverberating throughout the home and seemed very close. I walked to the other side of the bed after looking out the windows and attempted to wake my husband. I was shaking him and telling him to wake up. He sat up and I said, ""Do you hear that? What is that noise?"" And this is the weird part. My next memory was waking up in bed on my side on my back ( I never sleep on my back ) with my arms folded across my chest ( mummy style ). The first thought I had was how did I get like this! I have no history of sleep disorders and do not take drugs. I asked my husband immediatly if he remembered the night before when I woke him and his reply was "" yes, didn't you say you heard something?"" And that was all he remembered. I also had a small child at the time and she was safe in her room when this was going on. That morning I rushed to my mother-in-laws to ask her if she heard anything that night. She said no, but later that day I visited my mother and went directly to the piano and instantly picked out the single note that vibrated through my home the night before. It stayed with me for days. Naturally people thought I had dreamt the whole thing but I expressly remember going to my husband side of the bed and shaking him awake. Anyway that is my story. I never saw a thing but the tone satys with me to this day. What do you think about that? ((name deleted))",2006-10-30T00:00:00,32.2678,-93.79130000000002

(i later found out that shirley mc claines ""center"" is there and they confirmed the sighting, which makes it less or more credible but i'm unsure of which)as soon as we reenteered the freeway we saw a huge cone shaped foggy light approx 300 ft wide at the base. it was loosley defined in shape and was surrounded by a white foggy mist although it did maintain the shape of a cone/christmas tree throughout the event duration. we pulled off at the next rest stop (maybe 3 minutes farther north) and got out to watch it. one car pulled off, threw away a soda can, and left without looking. a truck driver was parked and out polishing his grill (at night?) with his back to it. at the top was a single point of light that seemed stationary but was then shot off like on a rubberband. we then drove north to trinagulate it's position, size and shape and exited several times to do so. we were able to determine that it was very large and was centered just slightly north over the munds park exit, slightly north of the freeway onramp on the west side if going north on I 17. at one exit we pulled off to get closer for more details and a truck passed us coming out of a dead end dirt road. we then turned around and crossed the highway to the east side of 17 and drove up to see the object from a higher vantage point. we then got back in the car and rushed to pull off at our exit, kachina village, we went into the small convenience store. the clerk was overwhelemd as the police scanner was processing tons of calls. when we arrived home a few minutes later, i phoned our local npr station at nau and was told other reports were being ca! lled in. at approx 6am the following morning a formation of seven black helicopters flew very low over our home in the direction of the sighting. they came form the north. it was later said to have been a launch at vandenburgh afb BUT both of us are from california and have seen MANY launches. this was not a launch. we later confirmed (to absolutley convince ourselves with proof by comparing what we saw to an actual launch as seen from the excat same location) we further validated this by taking a friend to the launch which the three us witnessed from the munds park rest stop in jan 99. it confirmed that what we saw in oct was definately not a launch from vdb afb, not even close. the person at npr relayed this answer/info to us the next day (10/9/99). my immediate feeling was that most who saw this would be convinced by this explanation hereby redecuing a majority of reports. the clerk at the store said that as the reports continued that evening on her scanner, the sighting was reported from as far south as phx and as far north as the utah border. several times after the event we attempted to get to the exact location but were unable to do so. for years now i have waited to see another report on this date and have decided to share now for clarification and/or coinciding info or events. as much as 40 minutes after the sling shot effect, we could still see the north end of the mist from our home. the oddest part was that the mist hung in the air and stayed in a loosely shaped cone for more than 45 minutes as it slowly disspated. this is the first and last time i've seen this type of event. i will file a report about another incident near corvalis or, in 1996, where a triangle formation was surrounded by a bluish mist before it disappeared. lastly, i will file a report for may 10, 2004 which occurred at la cienega lake on the white mountain apache reservation. it was three lights in a triangle formation but as there was no occlusion we determined there were three seperate objects/lights. they may have been the NOSS! sat's h owever it differed from other possible NOSS sat sightings reported to you. i noticed today that az had alot of sightings in june 2004 and for ours there were 4 sane witnesses. again, we ""felt"" compelled to be at this particular spot and time to see something and indeed we did.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,34.9456,-111.6402

I could not even make out a shape; I only could see this row of lights and darkness behind them.  I drove by very slowly with the window down.  No noise and no movement came from it.  I decided to come back the next day to see why/where lights had been erected.  I drove to my home in the town up the road.  As I drove up the cross street to my street I was shocked to see these same lights moving very slowly up my street, perpendicular to my car.  They were about 20 feet in the air; they clearly were not on the ground.  I stopped the car, opened the window and turned off the car lights and engine.  I watched these strange lights go to the end of my street, across the street I was on, and continue over the field on the other side.  The object produced no sound at all the entire time I watched it.  I was totally spooked by this time and drove into my garage as quickly as I could.  The next day I went back to where I thought lights had been erected and found nothing but an empty field with a few trees.  Strangely enough, three months later I came down with cancer.  Years later I was watching a UFO report where an entire town sited a UFO.  They cont! acted a nearby air traffic controller who could not see the UFO on radar, but could see it with his naked eyes.  The description the controller gave of the lights and the representative drawing showing the orientation of the lights were identical to what I saw.

As I turned my head back to the west I saw what looked like a black square with sparks shooting off from in front of it, flying at an unbleivable speed and dissapeard over the treeline in about another 2 seconds.  The sparks looked exactly like what you would imagine a childs sparkler on new years would look like all around the black box.

I was a freshman at Arizona State University and my buddy and I decided to go hiking one weekend up in Sedona.  I'm not positive as to the date, but I'm pretty sure it was in the Spring and though I don't know the exact time, I'm positive it happened in the afternoon.  When I say it 'happened' I'll have to clarify.  We were hiking around one of the trails on the edge of town and neither of us remembered seeing or hearing anything at all.  However at one point on the trail, we had a passer-by take two pictures of us, one right after the other perhaps 10 seconds apart (just to make sure they turned out).  When I developed the film, the first of the photos had a very distinct image in the upper left hand corner whereas the the second had no such image at all.  The image was of a long, slim, black object in the sky, tapering to a point at one end and a hook at the other.  The image appeared in no other photo in that roll of film.  It's obvious from looking at it, that it wasn't just something on the lens - after all, it's in one photo but not the other and the woman never wiped the lens.  And I know it's not the photo paper used because it showed up on the negatives.  I've also tried scanning the photo into my computer and zooming in to get a better look.  The edges are well defined; it's not as though it's a distortion, lens flare or blur.  It was jet black and it was out in broad daylight - I have no idea what to think.  I'm sorry, but I don't really know what else to say about it.  I can't remember the name of the trail, but I know it was near a pizza place right off Highway 89A.  I think the name of the pizza place is Moondog's Pizza?   It's just a tiny mom and pop joint.  The only other thing I can say is that I still have the photos, and most probably the negatives.  I've never seen anything of this nature in a photo, which is the only reason it caught my attention.  I'll try uploading them later today to the email address.

Me and him were looking up at the sky and we noticed a v formation of orange objects. They were very hard to see since they were so high up. We had problems just trying to follow them.

I was laying on our bed in master-bedroom just gazing at the stars as it was a still/quite night.  We have a sliding door from the bedroom and the kitchen area leading out to patio.  I noticed a bright white, round object.  What made me aware/alert that it was not a star was that it was Number 1:  Making itself WINK in and OUT.  2:  It made itself GROW LARGE & then GROW SMALL again repeatedly.  This went on for awhile.  3:  I decided to call a close friend of mine that I had worked with in the Aerospace Industry locally years ago to come over and see what I was witnessing.  So she came over with one of her brothers to see the object.  We went into the Kitchen and started to watch the object from the sliding glass door inside the house in the kitchen area as it was cold outside.  We witnessed the object continue to WINK IN AND OUT and Change Size.  Then we watched it do MANUEVERS at HIGH SPEEDS across the Sky then stop and then REVERT BACK to the original area it first was seen.  We got excited.  We also saw a Small Commerical Airplane in the area and that Airplane took off as fast as it could when it saw the OBJECT we was seeing.  It got the heck out of the area as fast as it could.  We all laughed together because we all thought gee we are glad we ain't up there with that strange object in the sky.  My friends brother however after awhile he was in denial of what we was seeing so he made excused by saying it had to be someone pointing a flashlight in the sky playing tricks outside.  I never bought into that theory as you would have to be an idiot not to realize the object we saw a flashlight could not perform that kind of manuever nor that high up in the sky as well as blink in and out and disapear from the naked eye and then reappear.  The next night I decided to borrow my friends husbands Binoculiars to view the sky and see if the object would reappear.  This time it was ANOTHER object far up into the sky it was Triangle Shape in size with Three round objects underneath on each point of the craft.  It was stationary.  I placed a call this time to Nasa up in Palo Alto/Sunnyvale area in the Bay Area.  A lady got me in touch with a well-known Scientist, book author who studied this type of stuff.  He was a member of Mufon he and his partner came and interviewed, video-taped me.  Several years after these events while I was out in our Hot tub in the backyard I witnessed a Light PINK Translucent UFO that was able to Appear out of no where and it was almost in the shape of a FLY just to give you an idea of the SHAPE.  It somewhat flowed and then disappeared.  It was most incredible to have seen out of all the ones I have seen over the years.

We then noticed that it did not have wings of any kind, it was a solid traingle with bright white lights in each corner and a few little red lights in the middle of the object. I think what was weirdest about the object is the way it was hovering...I can't really explain it but it was like nothing I had ever seen, it was so still and moving in a perfect circle...the lights in the middle of the craft were moving in a circle also but at rapid speed.  We watched it for a bit and the more we looked the more freaked out we got and my mom decided that she wanted to drive away.

I thought that it might crash onto Veirs Mill Road!  It was moving slowly as it crossed the road, which caught my attention, as I'd never seen anything like this before .  I saw 3 white lights on the bottom of the aircraft, no red/yellow/or green lights, just 3 white ones.  The craft looked to be triangle in shape, and not very tall.  it looked like a flat triangular object.  To the west of me (on University Blvd) were 2 radio communication towers.  I watched this aircraft fly slowly towards the 2 towers.  It made a sharp right turn and faced the towers.  There it hovered for a few seconds, as if it was trying to maneuver the craft around the towers.  The aircraft lifted straight up and then flew over the towers.  It then made another sharp right turn (which I didn't think was possible with modern aircraft) and flew several feet.  It then made another sharp left turn and took off quickly into the night sky.  This all happened within a matter of a few minutes, while I waited for the light to change.  I wanted to get out of my car and ask the folks around me if they saw it too.  But I was dumbstruck by the whole thing, so I didn't get out and ask anyone.  I did keep pinching myself while watching this and telling myself that I wasn't dreaming.  After I got home I told my husband about it.  He fully believed what I was telling him because, as he told me, ""I know that you don't believe in aliens and UFOs...so for you to say that you saw something like this, I believe that you did.""  Of course, others thought I was nuts and asked if I had been drinking or was stoned.  I was neither of these things, but I know what I saw.  I'm not saying that it was a spacecraft filled with little green men, but it was something weird.  I brushed it off as some kind of highly-classified aircraft based out of Andrews Airforce Base, which is in the Washington-area.

I am resubmitting this report because I have not seen my original in the database.  I know that there was a move with your organization and it may have gotten lost.  This report or near version of it has also been submitted to ufo evidence. After attending a Traverse City West High School game during the fall of 2001 I got gas from the local gas station and traveled up Barnes Road heading west from Traverse City.  At the top I stopped at the stop sign and looking west over the tree line I could see bright lights coming in rather low.  My first impression is that it's an airliner coming in to Cherrry Capital Airport.  It did although seem rather bright and quite low.  I then took a right hand turn, a left onto Harris and then another left onto Cedar Run.  After about 2 miles I came to the top of a hill that overlooks the Cedar Run Golf Course.  At the top of the hill looking towards the southwest I could see a very bright airborne object.  This object was very large and emitted brilliant white light. As I traveled down the hill towards the object in my mind I tried to figure out what it could be.  I knew it wasn't an airplane because it was not moving, this object was just hovering above the golf course.  I knew it was not a helicopter because it was to large, about the size of a 747.  At the bottom of the hill and coming up next to the golf course I slowed down and rolled down the window.  I could not hear a sound and this is when I started to get scared because I did not know what it was and I had my four year old son in the van with me. The object was just over full grown sugar or red maple trees about 250 feet off the ground. The object was 150 to 200 feet long, 20 to 30 feet tall and probably within 600 yards. I continued west on Cedar Run over a hill and 2 people were standing outside looking in the direction of the craft.  I didn't want to stop because it was still to close and I was afraid. I have stopped at 3 houses since the episode and no one could recall the event.  The people at the house that were looking towards the golf course have since moved. I learned of this just a couple of weeks ago. What impressed me most about this object was the lack of sound for it's size.  I should have heard something. Also, at no point did I see it move, although I saw this object at 2 different locations. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I am an amateur astronomer. I was looking up at the sky while relaxing after an observation session on my back deck.   After about 15 minutes I was startled by a dark silhouette of an elongated triangle against the light polluted night sky fly over my head.  It was completely silent, nothing more than a black outline of an elongated triangle with no lights.  It blocked out the light of the stars overhead.  The whole incident occurred in a few seconds. It was no more than a hundred feet above the ground. It seemed about the size of my house.  My guess on size is that the short base (tail) of the triangle was about 30 feet.  The two long sides of the triangle about 50 feet.  I was only able to watch it for a few seconds. My rough estimate of speed was about 70 - 100 mph. I live near the airport so I see aircraft, lights, etc. everyday but nothing ever like this. For What It Is Worth: I wish I had known of a UFO Reporting Center at the time of the sighting. I recently saw a reference to your site on a National Geographic UFO special. That is the reason I am sending the report to you now.

I was staring at Venus when a bright light appeared just above it. It was brighter than Venus and moved over next to moon. When the UFO came to a stop, I recieved a telepathic message from the ship. My mind seemed to ""warp"" from my body straight to the UFO. I could see everything along the way, including the sheer size of the UFO. The UFO had three engines, and dozens of side guns. What I saw was a warship, hiding behind our moon by the time my mind reached it. My mind entered its bridge and came to a stop. A tall lizard-like alien stepped out in front of me. It was wearing boots, a cape, and a kind of uniform. It had a number of badge-like items attatched to it's uniform, just like a Marine officer wears badges. It spoke in it's own language to me, while it held a device. My guess is the device translated what it spoke for me to understand. However, the only words translated were the last two. They were ""not afraid."" It nodded to me and walked back to the bridge. My mind began to leave the warship, while it began to turn away from the moon. The warship created a small wormhole, flew into it, and was gone. My mind returned to my body, and I closed the door. I went back to bed suddenly tired. Over the past three years, I have experienced telepathic messages from the same alien. These messages are actually part of the same message told to me three years ago. The messages include information on alien scouts on Earth exploring certain parts of the planet. Another part of the message said that they want Earth to be an ally with them.

It was between 8:00PM and 11:00PM my wife and I where taking a drive to catch some fresh air. As we made our way down Batesville Pike road we noticed a strange object approaching us very quickly. There was a car in front of us that must have seen the same strange object as they pulled off to the shoulder about a car length ahead of us. My wife and I where just shocked and could not identify what was before our eyes. This thing (larger than a 747 from wing tip to wing tip) hovered about 20 or 30 feet above the ground right around some tree tops. There where multiple (best guess 20) bright white lights along the front of this thing. The object then moved quickly across the road and hovered over a thick wooded area before the object changed shape and seemed to land or disappear into the woods below. My wife and I drove off trying to digest what we had just seen. We drove about a mile down the road and decided to turn around and go investigate. When we returned to the spot nothing was out of the ordinary. My first instinct was to walk through the woods and see if I could find anything, but after having flash backs of (Fire in the sky) I decided against that. Now with that said I'll tell you that North Little Rock Airport is less than 5 miles from the spot of the sighting. It's a small airport with only one runway but what we seen was not using the airport. I also wonder if what we seen was some sort of secret military project based on the fact that there's a military base less than 3 miles from the spot of the sighting. When the object changed shapes and landed in the woods it landed on military owned property. So it could be one of the two 1) A secret military project or 2) A UFO ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

About a minute later it moved moved ahead of the plane.  A few seconds later, it repositioned itself to the rear of the plane, then back to the right flank of the plane.

After about 10 minutes or so, I happened to glance out my car window and noticed an intensely bright, self luminous, circular object which had the appearance of being set ablaze with an electrically charged reddish-orange fire. My first impression was that I was looking at the afterburner of an extremely close range F-15 or F-18, but I was confused as to how the object could remain stationary and why the flame didn't taper to a point. I could hear nothing. It hovered motionlessly for about 3 seconds; during which time small flecks of golden colored light began to appear within it. The red light then pulsated and the object accelerated up and away from my point of observation on a northwestern trajectory. The acceleration occurred in two distinct stages. Stage one was incredibly fast and stretched a band of neon-like red light across the sky. Stage two was even faster as the tip of the object became green and what had previously been small golden flecks of light now also became stretched to form very narrow but sharp edged lines within the larger red band. Finally, as if someone had stretched and let go of a rubber-band, the tail end caught up with the tip as it vanished from sight hooking down slightly at the last moment. The entire event lasted approximately 5 seconds, but it still left me sitting in my car trembling a bit. About a month later, I became so interested in what had happened that I decided to get some detailed maps of the area behind the Borders store front and check out what was back there. I roughly estimated the objects distance and began tracing my line of sight with a pencil. At 3 miles from my point of observation the pencil came to rest on the Stony Brook Nuclear Structure Laboratory. Naturally, this peaked my interest as I had already suspected that whatever I saw was plasma related. I've since spoken with a few of the professors who operate that facility and they've stated firmly that their equipment couldn't possibly have produced any energy related phenomenon outside of the building. Having said that, I am now certain of five things that the object was not 1)It was not some ridiculously strange experiment of S.N.S.L. 2)It was not a meteor (it remained motionless for 3 seconds and ascended). 3)It was not a reflection in my car window or a hallucination (I've since found an independent NUFORC witness who saw it) 4)It was not a plane (impossible speed and hovering) 5)It was not a naturally occurring plasma phenomenon (perfectly circular shape and rapid acceleration) So what was it? Well, whatever it was, it seemed to express an interest in the Stony Brook Nuclear Structure Laboratory. There remains the possibility of coincidence. But the more I investigate this phenomenon the more I uncover a direct link between these objects and all things nuclear. This suggests definite intent. Whether or not extra-terrestrials are involved is a separate issue, but I now believe that these objects are physical, technological, and intelligently controlled.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,40.9122,-73.13461875

I will try to relate this event in as much detail as possible but please understand that this event was as difficult to witness as it is to describe. I was outside sitting on a pier with 2 of my friends on a clear balmy june evening. We were looking at the sky(There is virtualy no light pollution on ocracoke island so stargazing is as involuntary as sneezing around here).We noticed very high up some of the ""stars""moving in erradic patterns.At first we thought we were seeing very high planes but then they would grow brighter and fade while moving at high speeds.We could not tell if we were seeing one object appear and reappear in another part of the sky or if there were several.Each time we would see a bright flash that faded as it moved sideways.We have all seen this before,we agreed it was a strange thing to see but we have always blown it off as military aircraft since we live close to so many airbases.After watching these lights for 30 minutes or so(they appeared in the south and to the west)we noticed a dim cloud high to the west over the pamlico sound.It was difficult to make out at first but as we watched it appeared to grow in size and brightness.The cloud was extermely high it looked as if it was occuring in the outer atmosphere and it was its own source of light.The 3 of us flabbergasted decided to go to the southern tip of the island to get a better look.As we walked the cloud kept getting brighter and took on a strange greenish hue similar to the bioluminecent green we sometimes see in the waves at night.Once we got to the state ferry dock the cloud had elongated and formed an arc.There at the docks many others had gathered to look at the massive glowing cloud.There was an air of silent awe and disbelif as people were asking each other,what is it?One man started yelling that we were all witnesses to a major event in history.This is history here!! he kept yelling.My friends and i decided to move away from the gathering crowd so we found a small pier to sit on and watch.As we sat there the glowing cloud seemed to be sort of billowing sideways extending itself in a slowly lengthining round tubilar form.It looked to me as if something massive had entered the atmosphere and was slowly making its way down through the diffrent layers.THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE.The inside of the cloud had small wisps in it that were brighter than the gas around them.They had longish tails and ranged from white to light green.I asked each of my friends to describe to me what they were seeing so that i could be sure i was seeing what i thought i was seeing.One of my friends said that to her the shape of the cloud looked like the long curved neck of a crane(the bird).As an hour,then 2 passed the ""arc"" OR ""cranes neck"" had turned on its side as it decended lower in the sky and continued to spead out.As it spread the light it carried weakened and the wisps within the cloud disappeared.By 2 in the morning the cloud had completely turned on its side and continued to spread out growing ever dimmer.At three oclock there was still a faint glow in the sky although the shape of the cloud was nolonger decernable.I must backtrack here to try to better descibe what appeared to have happened.It was clear that the cloud had begun much higher than where it vanished.There was a clear sense of depth and dimension in the clouds shape and movement.It seemed that its entry into the atmosphere had affected it via the different layers of air and tempreture it had passed through.By this i mean to say that the turning motion of the cloud appeared to be caused at least in part by air currents.(yes all of this was visable even at night,that is how bright and massive this thing was)What was I thinking?First it was frightening,an event of that magnitude no matter what is a major deal.I came to many conclusions with my friends.1,it was a collision of whatever aircraft we had been witnessing before.2,It was an outer atmosphere nuclear test by the military.3,it was an electromagnetic blast caused by HAARP experiments or 4 We were finally being invaded by someone from out there.But none of these theories explained very much.On its own the cloud was a magnificent phenomena but coupled with the other strange lights in the sky it becomes simply unexplainable a UFO.As I sat in silence with my friends watching the cloud disappear i assumed i would read of it in the paper,or see it on the news,no matter what i thought i would pursue it for the rest of my life.It never made the news that i could tell.My friends contacted others on the nieghboring Cape Hatteras sea shore.Even as some descibed seeing the same cloud thier sightings differed from ours by hours.I decribed this event to a good friend that also lives on the island but was not present that evening,he told me that he had been told the same story a year earlier by a man living on the mainland.The event that I witnessed with so many others had been seen before in the same place.It has taken so long for me to report this because i was unaware of this website.I am hoping that someone else who was there that night will also end up here in thier search for answers and put down thier own description of this awesome event.It may never be revealed to me what this was but it will always remain clear and unforgettable in my mind and i am quite pleased to have seen it.

As soon as I focused my attention on it, the light seemed to have dissapeared.  I however was able to adjust my vision quickly enough to notice two smaller points of light where the original bright spot was.  The two smaller points seemed to be at quite a high altitude, as a rough comparason for altitude, I would figure slightly lower than most orbital ranges for satellites.  They were positioned in a 45 deg. angle (see bottom for position diagram).  The points reconverged and diverged one last time.  One point went northwest and the other went south.  The point that went northwest, I lost track of when it flew in front of Orion's belt.  The point travelling south I watched for about 4 minutes until it veered southeast and it faded out of sight.

H1, although this event occured roughly 2 years ago, I felt that I wanted to share my story after watching a few documentaries of UFO's on television.  To begin, my family had a small get together at my house for dinner, and after we were just hanging out with my younger nieces and nephews playing video games. After the games, my cousin and I went out for a walk in my street, it was about 9-10 pm. Just about 2 houses away from my house, something from the sky caught my eye. I looked up and I saw 2 spheres(?), can't clearly classify it because the objects were far away, however they were clearly visible due to their illumination. After spotting the objects, I looked at my cousin, in which he was staring at it in the same amazement as well. Having to be skeptics of everything, i quickly suggested that it was an airplane or star of some sort. However, my theory was proven false after 10 minutes of staring at the objects. See, we've always noticed that airplanes have blinking lights, however these objects did not have any. Another thing, these objects moved in a wierd manner that they were like chasing each other. Also, after moving fairly fast, (unfamiliar to our eyes )they would just stay in place and be stationary for a minute or 2. Later they would resume moving around. Having to be a bit scared, my cousin and I were satisfied that these were UFO's. However, it doesnt stop here. After 10 minutes, the objects would suddenly dissappear in a flash, either they migrated in the speed of light, or they just turned off all their lights. So my cousin and I were looking everywhere, and still no sign(let me note, it was a clear night no clouds). 30 seconds or a minute later, they would reappear again and do the same routine, they would chase each other around and then stop all of a sudden and hover in the air. However it gets even wierder, one of the objects shoots some kind of light(laser), in which the light dissappears after a while it has been shot. We were thinking, that either the object shot the light towards the other object, or towards the ground, i don tknow, because like i said the light dissappears after a while it travels in the air. After all this they become stationary again, and all of a sudden one of the objects flashes away into the sky, and the other one follows. (again in such a speed, not familiar for us to observe). The whole siting took about 20 minutes, and those 20 minutes were standing in the same exact spot that we were, when we first spotted them. And believe me, after we saw those UFO's my cousin and I were still in awe of what we just saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My friends and I have been seeing flying objects in the Groveland Area of Blackfoot Idaho, for about 15 months consecutivley 2003-2004. It all began when my freinds had an experience out at their parents home, and ever since then we started looking upwards and were surprised to see how many sightings we did come to incounter. On the early hours of July 10 @ about 1:00 A.M. I was just home from work and was watching T.V. trying to unwind so that I could go to bed. My phone rings, I cringe to the thought of who it could be at that time of the day. It was my friends who where in the habbit of chasing bright orange lights we were seeing so much of in this area. They ask me with alot of ugency ""What are you doing?!!"" I tell them I was just watching T.V. My Friend then tells me there is this object going my way and that I should go out side and see if it flys by my appartment. I was kind of frustrated thinking I was wasting my time, because I didn't know if it was going to fyly directly by my house and i didn't know which side of my appartment I should look for it, plus I was tired. Just as I was going to head back inside I decided to look one more time, then I see it. I was standing out on in front of my driveway,looking south. there was no noise but this huge object was flying at the treetop level very slow. I remember standing there waiting for it to get closer, but as soon as it reached the tree line that was about 200 yrds away from where I was standing, the object stopped and hovered over the trees. There were no colored lights flashing, but It was so close that I could see it was in the shape of the chevron sign and what it looked like big windows around the sides of the object that was faceing me. I started to crouch down by my van thinking that the object was not advancing forward due to maybe it knew I was standing there. Then The object started to do something I did not even expect it to do. It started to move and it appeared like it was landing. The object started to hide lower and lower behind the trees. I was so amazed. We know this area and the direct spot it was hovering over and knew there were houses surrounding the feild it was hovering over, so it was impossible to drive around the block and see anything in the feild. By the time my freind arrived, we drove around the area and seen nothing. I told them what I seen, where and what it did. We stayed out side for about another hour just talking and looking up at the sky and still wondering what happend to this object, when one of a sudden we see this object take off from the south sky at a really fast speed. It looked like a falling star but only this star was shooting up wards from the ground. So the landing was in that area only we could not pin point it.

I was afraid maybe the gov't or someone would want to question me about it. But now a few yrs after, I want to tell my story. I was working on my computer one night then got a bit tired b/c it was getting late. I lied down, the bed was facing the windown and my toes were pointed right at the window which was about 4 ft away from me. Within secs of me lying down, my eyes were slightly open, I noticed a very bright fluorescent blue light that flashed for 2 secs. outside my window. I had off white curtains that covered most of the window. then right after that 3 small greyish figures flew into my bedroom, heads first one by one, then elongated and stood by my bedside. to on my side and one at teh end. They looked at that point about 5'6-6 ft tall, very slim, long skinny body, almost looks as if they were naked or wearing some sort of greyish suit that clinged tight to them. I couldnt tell if they were male or female, b/c they had no breast and didnt seem to have any male genitals either. They didnt appear to have any ears, a nose that only had the nostrals(little holes)showing, and very big almond shaped eyes and barely a mouth, just a slim line around the mouth area, which I'm assuming is their mouth. they didnt speak one word to me the entire time. I was so scared but I was motionless, I dont think I even tried to move. My first instinct was, okay i should assume they are evil, so i calmed down, but then the one closest to me reached their hand down at my chest area, I then pushed its hand away. i looked at one of the figures in front of me and it seemed scared that I was able to push the other's hand away. then they flew/floated out of my window heads first and were small again to fit through.  then there was the same fluresent blue light that flashed for 1 sec. then I got up from my bed and turned on my light. I was so terrified, i stayed up the entire night, and kept saying to myself, i can't believe that happened to me, This never happens in a well populated place like NYC. I was so scared that I didnt tell anyone until recently and since I didnt write down teh date or my experience anywhere out of fear, I dont recall teh exact time or date, but can only estimate. My encounter has stayed in my memories, that I could not erase. I dont think these beings are friendly though, and I dont think they are harmless either. if someone or something does something to you without your consent or without you knowing their intention, then they are violating us.

The object was a V shape but came to points. The object had faint lights on the tips of the wings and on the front tip. The object moved in a zig-zag path but didnt appear to be making much distance. Soon a friend came and picked me up but I made him pull over so I could point the object out to him. I was able to direct him to the object in the nights sky and sure enough it was stil WAY up there slowly moving in this zig-zag formation making no noise at all. The object was not completly opaque, it had an extremely faint metallic green-blue tint. We were able to watch it for a very very long time so we diceded it wasnt going anywhere soon so we drove to find another place to view it but when we arrived about 10min later it was no longer in the sky. I do not know if this was a black triangle that was distorted by the dark of night or somthing like that.

On August 21st 2004 and I thought I should add to that story what was witnessed by me and my family.  It was a beautiful evening. I was in my back yard in Oak Forest, IL.  With my wife, my two older brothers and my step son.   We were just hanging out enjoying the night when my oldest brother said ""check out those three red stars,"" and he pointed into the southern sky.  We all looked and noticed the three red lights that was probably described by a thousand people.  We saw them kind of hanging there, then moving in and out until, one by one they just kind of faded out. Not a sudden disappearance like turning off a light switch but rather a fade.  They would just fade slowly out. Shortly after that I noticed something strange in the northern sky.  There was this air ship (for a lack of a better term) that was moving from the north to the south.  This ship seemed to be moving slow but steady and as it got closer we got a real good look at it. It was black and shining and triangular. I could see the light from the surrounding townships reflecting off it or so it seemed. It seemed to be flying low also. Maybe two thousand feet off the deck, however I can’t say for sure. And it was silent. It didn’t make a sound, nothing at all and it was a real smooth flight path.  It didn’t deviate at all. It didn’t shake or anything. Just moving straight as an arrow.  Once it passed over our house (it was flying almost directly over our house) and headed out south it turned into one of those red lights for maybe three or four minutes and then faded like the other lights.  It was very strange to say the least.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,41.6033,-87.7547

I remember seeing a couple flashes of light in the star field and being frustrated.  I said to myself ""come on now lets not play hide and seek"" just then I spotted what looked like two saucer shaped craft at about thirty thousand feet. They were huge I could make out lights emanating out from the edges, while coming to grip with the fact that I am looking at real UFOS suddenly through my field of view at about five hundred feet flew a totally silent black triangle. I only saw it for a moment because I was looking through the binoculars and it was so close. At this point I put down the binoculars and went down to my mothers apartment to tell her whats over the roof I think she was concerned that I was going crazy. Sitting in amazement over what I had just seen I started to feel frightened, cotton mouth, heart racing, the works it felt like I was being probed while sitting in that chair. My mother calmed me down and I gained my composure back, I said to myself no more star gazing tonight!. The following night I called my sister to talk about the event, she is a spiritual healer (healingthehologram.com) I told her that I felt like the aliens probed me. She told me to ask what the alien called itself the name Ether came to my mind weird!. We talked for hours till 9pm and I felt much better. As I hung up the phone I looked up and out the skylight and this time gliding at about 200 feet and 20mph rotating slowly was another huge silent triangle with orange plasma round lights on each corner, there is no doubt that they knew I was looking at them, it flew directly over head then turned 90 degrees and flew off WOW up close and personal!

At about 4:30 in the afternoon on or about March 25 or 2005, my freind and I were out in my backyeard. I was sitting at my gold panning tub while he was looking into my side yard. My freind told me ""You need to check this out."" I thought he was looking at some flaw on my roof or a cooler leak etc...I just made some joke about not wanting to see whatever it was.  Then he repeated in a rather puzzled but stern voice...""No, I mean it, come here and check this out!""  I got up reluctantly and asked what he was looking at. He said ""I'm not sure what the heck it is. I thought it was a parachutis in trouble but it just doesn't look right for that."" He pointed in the general direction where he was looking. At first I didn't see anything, but then out from behind a tele pole I got my first glimpse of it. I tried to focus on ths object to tell what it was. Because of it's motion in the first few seconds of my seeing the object, I thought it was a kite. There appeared to be a tringular shaped object on top, with a smaller one below it. The lower craft appeared to be ""tethered to the upper, as it was moving back and forth in a pendulus swinging motion."" Initially it looked like a kite. However after watching it a few more seconds it became apparent that whatever this was was moving across the sky far too fast for a kite busted off it's string. Also, the pendulus motion in a constant back and forth arc below the upper object was very precise and rythmic in pattern.  The movement is really what made the sighting ""eerie/odd/unexplainable"" as with each cycle of back and forth motion (8 o'clock to 4 o'clock), the object(s) paused, then elevated and began another swinging cycle. At the end of each back/forth cycle, it paused, and elevated. I observed this happen aout 4 or 5 times and then the oddest thing happened...the little object on the bottom went in a full circle all the way around the top object in a matter of a second. It started in it's normal 8 o'clock position, but then did a complete loop around the upper diamond object and stopped on a dime in the 4:00 position, and then began another back/forth swing.  I ran through the house as the trees in my neighbors yard were now in the path of the object. I jumped on top of my freind's truck to see if I could find the object again from my front yard but it was no where to be seen.  There was no sound, no lights. The onjects were perhaps shimmering a bit, but the odd thing is I'm not sure if that was from it's reflective qualities or a ""blur"" as the objects were never crisply defined in my sight. I recall really trying to focus on them because of this aspect of their appearance, but to no avail. I could tell they were diamon in shape, with the shorter axis of the diamonds at 12 and 6 o'clock. The objects seemed to be tan to dark grey and varied in hue over time.  My freind and I remain pretty convinced this was something that defies any objects we could think of that might exhibit this sort of free flight. Again, it was the precise period of the swing, the repetitive precision of the starting and stopping points of the swing, the vertical elevation in between each cycle, and the swiftness of the loop around the upper object with it's rapid halt that made this sighting truly bizzarre to us. It's the only thing I've ever seen in my 48 years that still has me scratching my head. I'm a bit mad that I didn't write everything down that day, as I struggle to recall if I actually saw a tehter, or if it was just the precision of the movement of the lower object that implied such a tether (sorry) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

A little background information: me and a former friend of mine went to Lincoln to do some work for a few weeks and we stopped by the apartment of a girl I was fooling around with. (She lived a few blocks east of the capital building, a huge art deco skyscraper.)  Come midnight, the lights went down on the Capital and we sat out on her porch gazing up at the sky. I noticed a couple of points of light moving slowly across the sky towards each other (as airplanes would if they aimed for each other) except that the lights approached each other and danced around each other and sped away, like a satellite using gravity as a slingshot. They did this dance for a while, this happened for about ten or fifteen mintues, the lights would fade in intensity and suddenly brighten (although this change in luminosity seemed to be a separate phenomenon from the speed of the ""craft."") For about 15 minutes we observed 2, sometimes three lights (although one light would always be fainter in this case) doing an impossible tango in the sky.  My buddy thought it was fighter jets, and my former girl mentioned that the lights were well above the feathery cirrus clouds, and I'm pretty sure commercial aircraft don't fly that high. One guess of mine is that the lights were caused by craft skimming on the edge of the atmosphere (hte bright bursts of light caused much in the same way as the splashes caused by a water skier bouncing on the surface of the ocean.) Also the lights would travel below the skyline of Lincoln to almost directly overhead within seconds. We could not hear any engines of jets.  We debated this for probably 15 minutes before the lights faded off. As we were about to go inside I spotted a light again. (It was moving parallel to the power lines above where we sat.)  Suddenly the light brightened, and forked apart into seven or eight lights which for about two seconds moved in tandem with each other (horizontally?) before they began to swarm around and forward (like the flying machines moving en masse in the Matrix 3 or the meteors at the end of Contact moving in one direction) and shot up into the sky. (I called Lincoln 911 afterwards, feeling rather foolish when the woman who answered laughed at me.)  Even now I can believe what I saw; yet I can't. I am a skeptic through and through (I do not believe in the spiritual, I trust in science) and for me to see something with my own two eyes that not only defies the current laws of physics (or maybe it doesn't, not my field of expertise); for me to actually get a fundamental answer to the question of are we alone was something I never expected. I figured I'd die without answers to anything (or at least the big questions.)  Earlier today, a few of my friends and I got to talking UFOs and someone said I should document what I saw so . . .  Well, not much of a story, but when I looked on here to see if anyone reported anything about it and I saw nothing from 2005, I decided better late than never.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,40.80091454183267,-96.67416752988048

Me and two of my friends were walking down Columbia AVE. to go to an overpass around 10:30 PM to 11:00 PM and while looking at the dark pavement as we walked we noticed what we thought was a spot light coming from a police helicopter behind us. I knew from the color of the light that this was no ordinary spotlight, it was a blueish color that reminded me of the new headlights on some cars but casted no shadow. Curious as to what it was coming from we all looked back at the same time and seen a bright bluish white light hovering (no sound) above the last house on Virginia AVE. which was less than 75 yards away. Before anyone could even think of something to say the spotlight flashed toward the sky and faded out as if it knew we had spotted it but the craft remained glowing. About 2 seconds later still baffled we watched the craft dart off to the north with unbelievable speed (literally the blink of an eye) and was gone. about 2 to 3 seconds later we heard a very loud boom like thunder although there wasn't a cloud in the sky. Now I've never heard a sonic boom before but im willing to bet that is what it sounds like.  To this day my friends are reluctant to talk about this with other people for fear of ridicule, and we have no explaination as to what it was we saw that night.

I live beyond the distraction of city lights and sounds and in the midst of near dead silence and a glorious view overhead,I swear I was a witness to the following;  It was around 10:45 PM when I began preparing to retire for the evening. My wife and Miniature Dachshund had gone to bed about an hour before. My routine includes checking door locks,night lights,oven settings,candles,etc.This also includes a walk through our covered patio area out back where we often spend quiet time outdoors most summer evenings,weather and mosquitos permitting.We have a TV,a fan,candles and other items we enjoy out there just like any other room of our home. As usual,I went out to secure the patio.I stepped out onto our uncovered,attached patio where I began to take a big stretch and yawn before heading back in to the bedroom.My stretching motion shifted my head backwards and up toward the sky and..... there it was! In the sky directly above me,was a perfectly round,silent and still object slightly smaller than the full moons we have here,and not quite as bright,but similar in color.I knew from it's position in the sky however that it definately WAS NOT the moon!Our moon starts out in the eastern sky and moves east to west across the sky on the southern side of our house,regardless of the time of year,and is viewable ONLY from an area some fifty feet north of where I was standing! My eyes remained fixed on the object for about 10 seconds or less,at which time it very slowly moved off to the west/northwest,and faded away into the clear night sky. It's distance away from me when I first saw it was impossible to judge.I can only base it's size on the only object similar to it,the moon.When it began to slowly move away,it moved a distance of about one and a half to two times it's own size before fading out of sight,never making a sound of any kind.And as usual,you could have heard the hum of a mosquito's wings that night. I have waited this long to report my experience because I felt then,and still believe this was a sign from God,to let me know he has heard my prayers.

It was over De Soto Missouri on 7/13/2005 around 9:55 PM.  Two pinpoints of lights beneath a mostly cloudy night sky.  Several stars were visible.  The lights seemed to be below or just beneath the clouds, yet they appeared to be somewhat the same size pinpoints of light as the other stars visible in the sky.  I would guess around 20,000 feet.  When I first noticed the lights, they were engaging in a high speed circular chase.  The circle was proportional to a small diameter circle about the size of a quarter held at arms length.  They were moving at about 180 revolutions per minute for approximately 1 or 2 seconds before they split and went in the exact opposite directions.  I believe, near South and near North.  The Southerly light appeared to move away from the circle slower than the Northerly light.  Both lights never did disappear from my view for at least 5 minutes.

A bit long ago but I hadn't got any needs back then to share the world with my and my two friends's story. I have told a few people about my sightings but they wouldn't believe me and I don't want to realy talk about it either because the most people will think I made this up. Wich I realy don't. That night it was a bit cold but the sky was clear so I could see a beautiful lot of stars. I realy like to look at them because they make me feel so small in this world. Suddenly I saw a vague round shape in the sky. It was a sort of brown O with in the middle a red light a sort of dot. The object was realy small and I could not determine the distance. It could be realy big and far away but also small and just some miles away. I realy had to look good because I could see it hardly, even though it was a realy clear night. It flew from the south when it was heading North in a straight line and realy fast. Then it stopped and just stood still in the sky. This was the time I called my friends to look up. I pointed at the object so my friends could see it too. In a fraction two others just appeared and joint the first one. Not in a straight line this time because these two seemed to play with eachother. These two circled a bit around and then just dissapeared. The first one was still hanging there and faded away to the north. I realy don't know what it was. It could not have been an airplane because they don't move this fast and certainly they can't and play. The seem reason why it was not an satalite. I've seen satalites often and they look like a small star that is moving slowly in one straight line. I'm realy glad my friends saw it too because I was thinking that I was going crazy. I have never seen this strange sight again.  This is then one of a billion stories of an UFO sighting. I realy hesitated to place this story because of these lot and I think the larger part is made up just to get some attention. Anyway the reason for sharing is that I would like to know if somebody have seen a comparable sort of apearance, nothing else. I do not believe in alien invasions or hostile creatures that want to take over the world. I don't believe in alienmade circles in cornfields or that some people are taken hostage by aliens. I would not exclude it all because I'm openminded and I live in harmony with myself and others allthough I'm not religious. I do believe in life beyond earth but I think we're not ready yet to meet up with an alien sort of life because we can not even accept our own species. A matter of time I think that would reveal life from somewhere else then earth.  Thanks for reading my story.  For the investigator; I don't have any pictures or other proof of my sighting exept for my two friends. I hope I have given enough information but for further explonations please send me a email with questions I will answer as well as possible.

Summer, late August 2005.  I saw something in the sky.  While at Sunoco, I saw repeated flashing in the sky.  At first I thought it was lightning until I saw it repeatedly flashing in the exact same areas.  Over and again, tremendous lights reflecting amber and blue  circled in the sky.  The size and power of these lights had to be enormous and great respectively.  Why do I say that?  I will exlpain in a moment.  I watched from Sunoco's lot for almost twenty minutes, wondering if someone would noticed a muscle bound Black man hanging halfway out of an SUV staring in to the sky at almost ten thorty at night. To avoid potential harassment fron the police, I pulled into the next parking lot-Bank One next door-parked, and watched for almost another fifteen minutes.  Thinking the phenomenon would go away any time, I ventured home and told my wife.  From our backyard we could see the lights in the distance flashing again and again.  The boys were sleep so I told my wife no to trouble them and that I was going to drive towards the lights.  I drove slowly down mainstreets, backroads, and even dirt roads as it took me towards Ypsilanti.  Along the way, the flashes became bigger and the size of them more awe inspiring.  Thinking that since I went to Uof M in Ann Arbor even though I was lost on the dark backwood roads, eventually I would find my way.  As I saw the lights better throught he clouds, I noticed the were reflecting upwards off something.  The reflections, I estimate, were fifty to eighty feet and reflected almopst violently over and again like they were atop something spinning.  It was somewhere close to Ypsilanti that I realized that the sky was discolored.  Having gone camping numerous times, I know that the lights ina great number makethe sky reflect a deep violet and makes the stars hazy to see.  In the country setting, the sky had a slight violet tint to it because it was not so far removed from townships, cities, and the like to have the untainted skyline.  As I watche dthe lights become larger and more brilliant, I noticed that the violet-black was off-colored for at least five square miles.  The color was deep, dark grey instead of violet-black.  Whatever was in the sky also was displacing the clouds-the clouds being pushed is something I think added to the dark greyish hue.  I felt-I distinguish between feel and think because there was nothing logical about assuming anything-that there was some physical activity beyond that of immense, rotating lights.  I drove after it for long minutes until, even in Ann Arbor, I became lost.  The lights seemd to become fewer in flashes and more dim.  I rounded a bend to enter a freeway-a freeway that showed me that whatever it was had been moving because I was very, very far from where i thought I was heading.  Then I say trees and long grass sweep forward and globular lights reflecting a flash of red and blue shoot inot the sky from  what I could tell was an empty field.  Immediately it began raining on par with the power of a tropical storm.  I actually had to pull over and wait for the rains to calm which is no small thing for a seasoned Michigan driver.  Within a few minutes, the rains stopped as if they had never started.  I saw something in the sky that night, a year ago, that has stayed with me and changed my view of the world permenantly.  Worldly things beyond keeping my family fed are so insignificant compared to the mystery of what I saw.  I have no explaination of what it was but there was something there.  I have told a few people about what I saw but in the age of liars and attention seekers, people who own up to seeing UFO's-yes UFO's not alien starships but an UNIDENTIFIED flying object as in something I could not recognize/identify-typically ar elabelled crazy, mocked, or ruined by negative attention.  Other than my wife, I have no one to share this with and therefor, I have written this finally. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was volunteering my time at the 4th district Police Station in New Orleans. I  was a Paramedic for about 25 years and was CEO of a large EMS until 2004 when I sold the company and was in retirement.  The sky was full of stars, there was no power for close to a hundred miles in all directions, everything was pitch black in the City and, the sky was bright. This was the first night any of the military showed up and we started getting additional manpower from ICE and many Police Departments from all over.  I was waiting on the commander,I usually road with him and the Leiutenant. We had two military guys that were there when I arrived. One of them was playing with a Pit Bull puppy that was hanging around the station. He had two night vision goggles with the single scope.  I asked if I could try them out and he told me to knock myself out. I looked around a few minutes then turned to the sky. Ihave never seen so many stars in my life the sky was glowing and I was in awe. I was looking to the west nw when I saw what appeared to be a really bright shooting star very high crossing to east se. It crossed the sky within a second or so and it was well east of us when it stopped, made a purposeful movement like a semi circle then shot directly south and disappeared. I was freaking out and couldn't believe what I saw. It was about the size of a pea with a tiny haze around it when it made the turn it seemed to have a slight distortion in the haze.Almost like a tiny tail. I kept looking in astonishment and I kept seeing them all over the sky. I pulled the night goggles off and I couldnot see them at all. I got to thinking they could be  birds or bugs or maybe a bats. I went near a light run by the generator and with ina few minutes ruled that out. I kept looking in fascination I saw other objects that flew straight over with an angelic glow or or aura, but these looked like they were orbiting. They traveled straight and lower in the sky at a fixed altitude.This I felt confident was a satellite. The UFO's were completely different,They moved much faster had purposeful movement and made very erratic turns not capable with any aircraft I know of. A captain from a sherrif;s in Iowa was sitting with me and saw them as well, we were taking turns with one pair and he was as amazedas me. About 3 or 4 am some clouds moved in partially blocking the sky.I was looking up and saw one coming from the west when it made sharp turn came directly over them staion  under the clouds, it was huge and fast, it covered my whole feild of vision in the goggles.It moved so fast it was like a blast of light moving over, no wind,no sound.  I tried throughout the night to film it with the google over my camera but it didn,t  work. The cloud cover got thicker and I didn't see them after that. I am convinced that ! you can probably see these on clear nights with good night vision goggles. I saw too many of them for it to be afluke and I would be interested to know if any one else reports similar experiences.I saw at least fifty of them over a three hour period. I have never seen a UFO before this and I really don't believe that aliens could reach us if they do exist, but I saw what i saw.

I kept driving in the direction of the light, and I noticed it descending and approaching the ground.  I turned off the main road and headed East, but that's when I noticed the light was following me and getting closer.  As it grew closer, I was able to see it more closely.  ""It"" was four diffused lights, swirling around as if chasing one another in circles.  They did not have definite shapes, like lightbulbs would, but the lights seemed to swirl and liquify and move in inconsistant, constantly changing blob-patterns.  I rolled down my window and waved, and the lights caught up to my car and ""we"" were traveling side-by-side (though the lights were in the sky, and I was on the road).   I took several more turns, now onto a backroad, but the lights followed. Somewhere along the way, one of the lights must have taken off, because when I looked back, there were only three lights following me.  I finally made it to my house and ran inside to get my roommates (to make sure I wasn't seeing things). The four of us (roommates) went outside.  Everyone claimed to see it at the time, though now one of my roommates denies that she saw it. One by one, my roommates went back inside the house while I stayed outside and watched it for probably 15 more minutes.  I noticed it getting further away now, heading West and rising higher in the sky.  As it got further, the lights stretched and combined, forming a thin, bright, horizontal light.

Light Pair exhibiting impossible aerial behaviour, & not fitting air traffic profile. This occurence was several months ago, but only recently did I become aware of a place where it could be 'reported'.  The UFO's came to my attention as I stepped outside my front door for some fresh air, out on the eastern sky I noticed two single orange lights, and my first thought was plane. DFW airport isn't more than a half hour away so air traffic passes through quite frequently, but as I examined the two lights their behaviour and the lights themselves on each of the sources became odd to me. I quickly dismissed the profile of plane as for many reasons. The objects lacked the blinking red tail or wing lights, their behaviour as well seemed more like a helicoptor as they kept no straight path and would change direction quite erraticly. My mind finally assumed them to be UFO's as their speed was somewhat impossible for a helicoptor to match, they weren't jets by any means but how quickly and easily they flew through the air and changed direction almost on the fly kept me questioning. It was impossible for them to be planes, and if they were helicoptors then the only way the dominant lights could move so fast was if they were infact closer to me than I'd assumed. Of course had they been closer I would of been able to hear the engines. The perceived altitude, the fact that only one light could be determined, the behaviour, they just couldn't be defined as anything man made that I had knowledge of. Wishful thinking has me hoping that they're the latest technology we're not being told about. Like the Blackbird and the wave of stealth fighter development that had people pondering years ago. For anywhere from five to ten minutes I stood on my porch scratching my head as I watched these two lights. They appeared to be a pair, as well, as they stayed within close proximity to each other, they kept their maneuvers in a small patch of sky for most of the time that I witnessed them. As I was about to head inside to get a second opinion on what I was looking at, the two lights parted ways as one went farther out of sight and dropped below the horizon, and the other shot at a remarkable speed off to the north and out of sight.  For a person who lives near an airport, and sees planes and helicoptors on a daily basis, I found for the first time something in the air that had me vexed. So I suppose this makes them UFO's, aliens I doubt however. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2006-10-30T00:00:00,33.0735,-96.9032

Of course that night absolutely nobody in my neighboorhood or surrounding neighborhoods had any electricity at all. Most of Dade and Broward counties we pretty much pitch black. I don't even think anyone in our near by neighborhoods had any generators until at least 1-2 days later or so, and  our area alone went about 2-3 weeks without electricity. That night my 10yr old brother, my mother and I were outside our house in the porch area. We were grilling some food and pulled some chairs out. We were looking up at the skies and really just admiring the stars and how beautiful it looked since you can't really see & appreciate them in the city. It was really, really dark and had a perfect view of the skies. We were just staring up a few minutes when my mom said look at that star it's moving. All the other stars in the skies looked normal and in place except this one that was actually moving. We could not see a shape or outline of any sort. I couldn't say that it looked like a saucer or diamond or anything it just simply looked like a moving star unlike the others. Just a bright light but not abnormally bright and it looked very, very far up in the sky. Of course the three of us just looked at it and followed it's movement as it was heading north. We were mesmerized and couldn't take our eyes off of it we kept saying it can't be a plane because to our knowledge their were no planes flying that night due to the hurricane. And it just seemed so far up I've never seen a plane fly that far up before. Then we noticed another moving star behind the first one almost like out of nowhere so here there was two moving stars that seemed to be flying pretty fast and not necessarily in a ""perfect line"". I'm not going to say it was doing any crazy twists and turns or anything like that either just not a perfect line and a plane couldn't make those fast movements. My mom and I just kept saying it can't be a plane besides there are no planes flying tonight. We kept asking what is that? Do stars move like that?   And if so why are these the only 2 stars moving like this and the others are standing still? My brother kept asking me is that a UFO? We followed it for a good 5+ minutes eventually when it got past a certain distance we couldn't see past our roof and lost it. But right when we thought we lost it almost immediately after that over our roof we saw what looked like a shooting star. I don't know much about shooting stars or anything like that but whenever I've seen a shooting star or seen it portrayed usually it seems to shoot downward and this shot upwards and it was brighter then anyone I've ever seen and almost in a line not ""arched"". That could've just been a coincidence I don't know about that I just thought the timing was either weird or perfect. We just kept looking up and kept asking ourselves what was that? Did we just see a UFO? Then when we thought the action was over we continued to look around and I noticed another moving star this one was brither and bigger then other two but it couldn't be the same one because the other two had just past over going north this one was just approaching us and it was on the west side there was no way it could've turned around that quickly in a matter of a minute! I said look  another one up there,my brother asked where?I pointed at it, as I said it was approaching us and this one didn't look as high up as the other two. He still  couldn't find it. I told him give me your flashlight. We had one of those long black flash lights like the kind cops use a good bright one  nearby he got it and gave it to me. I turned it on and said see look up there and pointed the lit flash light in the direction of the star. As soon as I turned on the light and pointed in it's direction the star dimmed it's lights!It just looked like one of those really dim stars but you could still see it  moving, and he said why did you point at it, it must've seen you! Now it's going to come after us and he actually got scared. Shortly after it dimmed it's lights it disappeared behind a cloud. This one we only saw about 2-3 minutes. We waited for it to come out the other end of the small cloud but it never came out. And how weird was it that it immediately dimmed it's lights when I pointed my flash light in it's direction. My brother kept asking what if it comes back later tonight? Do you think it saw us? He was actually scared and we just told him that if it was a UFO it was gone now. We stayed looking up for another 15 minutes to see if anything else would happen but that was it we didn't see anything else. My mom's friend claims that she saw the moving stars also that night. I actually went out the rest of that week every night with my little brother for a couple of hours a night to see if we saw anything else but we never did.I was not scared I don't know if mom was she didn't say so. I was more intrigued and mesmerized then anything and I do believe I saw a ""UFO"" and I'll never forget that experience. I don't think my little brother ever will either. He was scared but intrigued also and is now all into UFO stuff which is how we found this site surfing the net.  We still talk about it of course, my dad laughed it off didn't take us seriously and my husband just said that's great honey. But the three of us know what we saw and it was not ""normal""  it was amazing there was something out there. (p.s. I am open to being contacted if this is of any interest or help of any sort to investigators)",2006-10-30T00:00:00,,

I cant remember the exact day but i know for sure it was no so far away from holloween. Well, the 7 of us were talking in front of a friends house, from this view we could see another town across which is like less than a mile away and we can have a good view of the whole town. Since i was the only guy there i was just standing near the entrance door. There was steps in the entrance door so when i was standing on these stairs near the door i had a way better view of the town and the road the travels along the side of the town. Since my friends were talking aobout some spooky stuff, i wasnt paying attention. At this point i was just standing by the door looking around everywhere and mostly directly to the other town. Forgot to mention that the town i was looking at was San Miguel Tecuitlapa. My parents home town has a name but i rather not give it. I was looking around everywhere. Sky was dark with stars in the sky, cold, little bit of breeze. During this month, there is usually alot wind and is very cold doesnot rain is like dry cold and in the mornings there is always alot of fog then fades away like at 10 am. But at night its all clear. Since i was standing up all the time, i sat down, i could still see the town from my position, then i started wondering again, trying to keep warm, and for some reason i turned to that town i had an urge to look, i saw a light. First i thought it was the towns radio guy, since his big speaker sticks out and has a flasing light(only turns the light on when he is on standby and has important anouncments to make to the town, which is rare). But i double checked and the light was right above the town cuz, first it wasnt blinking and second there was no blinking light on the anoncers house. i king of just like didnt care at first. But the light was there for 2 min already and i started to wonder. than i told everyone else about it and started looking. They started talking about what the light is, like legends and stuff, that that like is a witch and stuff. I told them ""no it cant be, why would a witch stay hovering like that for more thatn 2 min, thats an easy target for any sharpshooter around there"", and everyone kept quite. everything was quite, no breeze, sky was clear, cold, then i started telling them "" its a UFO,but be quite lets observe very well. Dont freak out okay"" and so we were mostly quite just whispering. The object was moving slowly and didnt move alot its just move probobly like 200 ft at most. We were still whispering and all of us were just looking at it, didnt move our eyesight from that point. Suddenly it just disapeared. JUst faded. The light just faded as in a light bulb turns off when u turn of the lights. got small and disappeared. Everyone freaked out everyone went to their houses exept me. I stayed with my friend at the door, i just stood their.............had goosebumps....my friend asked me if i was okay...i said yeah im good........im going home lol......i got home connected my camera. Now i have the best room in the whole housei get the view of pretty much the whole town i live in, i can see San Miguel, this other town called Santa Ana, part of San Juan Atenco, the road that travels along San Miguel.........so i stood by my window for a while and nothing.... That was it i was hoping to see it again and record it but no .....nothing......  Reminder: Almost all towns are surrounded by thousands of acres of crops..Around San miguel there isnt much, but on the back of the town there is lots of hills with alot of green. Behind our town there are alot of big hills and lots of crops, lots of trees and really dark at night. Around San Juan atenco there are alot of Fields of Corn around there that widespread all the way to Santa Ana. Our town has historic places....like two old Ranches that were big before.  Thats all i know about this for now.....ill then give more info if i have more or remember more.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Lee vs Mesquite High School Football game.  Just before the game started I noticed the light to my left.  I beleive I was facing West sitting in the East stands.  The full moon was high in the sky approximately at an angle of 50 degrees West from where I was sitting and 55 degrees approximately above the horizen.  Looking at the Moon just before Kickoff about 7:20 p.m. I noticed a dim very small circle of light hanging in the sky very close to the Moon. I tryed to get my wife to notice it but she was more interested in the introductions for the game. There was to much noise on the field and in the stands to get anyone close to notice the light.  It was almost to dim to catch anyones attention.  Within about three minutes the light started to move.  It was obviously a great distance away. Perhaps very close to the distance of the moon. The light moved very slowly, at least to me it appeared slowly away from the Moon to the East a short distance.  It was definitely not a star or planet.  It turned up and made a tight turn back toward the Moon and continued the turn until it approached the path it had previously taken in the East. It continued the Easterly direction and was either moving away or down when an even smaller ligth emerged from either the Moon or from behind it. The smaller light was a little brighter than the large light but not by much.   It seemed to head toward earth for a moment then turned at a much higher speed and appeared to race after the larger light.  As it reached the larger light, they both faded out and disappeared. I didn't see a collision.  The lights were definitely under the control of an intelligent sourse. The large light was to me about the size of a pin head and the smaller light about a third that size.  Obviously they had to be extremely large objects to be seen that far away and their movement was deliberate.  I really doubt that anyone else saw these lighted objects because the were so dim, so smal! l and we re only visable for such a short time.  I guess I should have stood up and shouted for others to look but at first I expected to discover some natural cause for the big light and the small one moved quickly and was gone in about 30 seconds. The lights of the object did not shine like an electric light sourse but were rather dull. However they were extremely far away. The larger light was about the color of the yellowish Moon and the small light a little whiter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrects date of sighting, which was October 28, 2005.

Another set followed and eventually the last pair disappeared over our building.  all were silent, and no actual object was seen, only lights.

It was all in the Immigration Rally in Dallas Texas on April 9th 2006 at around 13:30. Me and one of the people i was marching with saw this strange object changing shapes in the sky. We didnt know what the object was. We just saw it as a ballon or something. I jokingly said, ""look, bro , a ufo!"" we had a little laugh, not thinking anything of it. But the reason I am bringing it up now is because i was just curiusly looking at ufo pictures on the net (10/06/2006), and it was a ufo that looked exactly like what we saw on that day. I was overwhelmed when I saw the picture, and I immediately thought that some research area might want to know. It was a white cigarrette-like shape, except it moved around, and it seemed to make movements as if it was weightless (thats why we thought it was a balloon at first). It seemed to move like if it had no weight, like if the air was making it move. It was pretty high in the air, probably the elevation that a airplane would fly. The object didnt really seem to move location, it was just like standing still, like if it was just observing how the 300 thousand+ people were marching. At times the object would look like a horizontal cigarrette, and at times it looked like a bomerang like shape. It didnt seem like if it was changing elevation, just the movement of the object. Like I said before, I've held this in for about 6 months because i just thought of it as a balloon. The pictures I'm going to send are not from the Immigration Rally, but they're from some couple in Los Angeles. But the pictures are not of something that somewhat looks like what I saw, but they ARE OF WHAT I SAW, the SAME EXACT THING. In the pictures you can clearly see what im talking about when I said that the object changed shapes. Again these pictures are not mine, they were taken by a couple in Los Angeles.

It was falling away from us diagonally.  The object was VERY bright and white.  It was a full moon that night and yet this object was just as bright or brighter then the moon and even as it moved away from us it didnt lose ant light.  And it was obvious to both of us that the object was moving AWAY from the car, meaning that it couldn't have been a plane or helicopter light shining directly at us (it was much too bright anyway).  From our view point the object was the size of an eraser head of a pencil.  It was heading towards the highway and when I stepped out of the car to continue watching it over the line of trees, I saw it quickly go straight up and disappear just as quickly as it appeared.  I have been interested in astronomy much of my life and I know the difference between a comet/meteor/shooting star and this was without a doubt none of the above.

It was a clear night, and I was looking to the South, when I noticed an unusual amount of what I first thought was aircraft activity over Portland lining up for approach at PDX.  Then I realized that I've never quite seen so many aircraft in the air at once, and that if it was part of practice for an airshow or military maneuvers, it was a bit too late at night.  Even if they were conventional aircraft, they were spaced much to closely together to be on any sort of landing approach to Portland International Airport.  The lights were amber in color, about twice as bright as the stars, and numbered in 6 or 7 pairs.  From my perspective, they were about 10 degrees off the horizon, and each pair of lights were coupled at a 45 degree angle from each other.  Each pair was separated from the next by about an inch at arm's length.  The entire assembly of lights seemed to be in formation, keeping the same spacial relationship from the others the entire time.  The group of lights formed a slight arc that was lower in elevation at the east end.  The group of lights moved in unison to the southeast, losing elevation until out of sight below the treeline that makes up the horizon from my vantage point.  At times the lights seemed to shimmer a bit, but that very well have been due atmospheric distortion due to their proximity to the horizon and the (apparent) distance involved.  I called for my wife and son to come take a look.  My wife scoffs at any mention of UFOs, so I wouldn't alert her to it unless it was very clearly odd.  My son (7 years old) made it out first, and viewed the lights with me.  My wife didn't make it out for several minutes, and by the time she arrived outside the lights had dropped below the trees on the horizon.  I often can see lights from aircraft taking off and landing at PDX and Vancouver airstrips - in fact they appear at the very same spot on the horizon where the lights in question were.  Planes always appear as a white and red flashing light, and these were simply glowing amber lights, much different and brighter than the normal aircraft lights.  In fact, at the time of the sighting, a plane with ""normal"" plane lights passed amidst the lights from my line of sight, and stood out clearly as it moved through the area.  I'm just now submitting this because I just visited this site and noticed the request for reports to be submitted on this subject.  I originally dismissed the event because, after looking for it on the news sites the next day, I didn't see any report of it, and thought perhaps I was overreacting to it.  I would be happy to take a picture from my vantage point and edit in the lights with Photoshop to send to you, if you wish.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,45.8623,-122.6704

I was doing yard work and scanning the sky for the local redtail hawks when my eye was drawn to a moving object far above traveling west to east.  It flew silently in a straight line and into the horizon of the trees.  Incredibly, it appeared to be camouflaged with the blue sky.  What was remarkable was I never would have noticed it in the sky except that the moment my eye caught it, it was moving over a cloud.  I saw a definite fixed shape and structure.  Even once it passed the cloud its outline was well defined although the blue color of the craft matched the sky.  It was shaped, overall, as a triangle, but its edges were rounded and the rear edge slightly curved towards the front ""point"".  I suppose the ""boomerang"" description is most applicable, but its width was fatter or thicker than that word implies.  It may or may not be pertinent to note there were no lights beaming, flashing, or shining.

He lives on New Holland Road on the north side of Holland Michigan. Holland is located on the west side of the state of Michigan and is right on the Lake Michigan coast line. My friends house is about a 5 minute drive to the coast line. He has about 9 acres in a relatively undeveloped area of town with very few lights obstructing the evening sky. We were just looking at the stars and as I looked at the western sky (toward Lake Michigan)  I saw a very bright shining light. This light appeared white and bright. It shimered at times. I did not see where it came from or how it got to that point in the sky.  I called my friends attention to it and he immediately thought it was very odd. We both have spent many evenings enjoying the stars and late night skies over his property and have seen airplanes and helecopters on a number of occassions. What struck us as odd was it seemed close. Eventhough it appeared low out over the western horizon as if it were a plane at +20,000 feet coming over the lake (which is common) the lights seem as if they were no farther than a mile away over an area used for agricultural purposes. The light kind of hung there with a shimering effect. It was moving and eventualy approached my friends property roughly flying in a westerly to easterly direction. As it slowly moved just north of our position we did see a few lights on the object. We saw a red light additional white light and a green light. This brought up the brief discussion that it could simply be a plane with red and green navigation lights but their were still some oddities to this object. First- it still appeared to be very close. Lets say...less than a mile and looked to be no more than a one thousand feet (at most) in the air. Second - other than some distant highway traffic sounds it is relatively quiet at my friends property. As I said earlier...we have watched many airplanes and helecopters fly throughout this airspace many times. The difference is that this object made NO noise. We ussually can hear planes and other aircraft for miles and even when they are 20,000 feet in the air. We kept listening for the noise and nothing. As it passed us by heading in a easterly direction it made a slight direction change heading slightly northeast.Still no sounds. It eventually disappeared from our view over the horizon.

The moment i noticed it, it was bright for a 5 second count standing still, then suddenly shot left about 5 ft.,stopped, then it was gone(light went out) Several friends where standing behind me, but not paying attention to what i just seen, so i said ""Hey, anyone just see that?"" they all joked and broke my stones, then about 4 friends and myself where looking for what i just descibed, when suddenly 1-red/orange light popped on, then the 2nd light, 3rd, and 4th, they all where in line same height off the sea, same distance from eachother, they stayed on for about 30 seconds then they went off in the same order they came on 1-2-3-4. We waited to see if there was any more activity for approx. 15-20 minutes with nothing more. Then the discussion started, I was in the Marine Corps and I immediatly said too high to be a ship/boat, forget flares of any type, and forget after burner, 3 out of my 4 friends all admitted never have seen this ever and no one offered a logical solution to this event, we believe we saw something that is not normal maritime behavior or normal airline/flight behavior",2006-10-30T00:00:00,33.68315,-78.93953909574468
Round white disk flying at low altitude followed by heavy downpour and boat sinking,Keene,ON,2006-05-21T13:00:00,circle,10 to 15 minutes,"Occurred : 5/21/2006 13:00  (Entered as : 05/21/06 13:00) Reported: 10/8/2006 9:10:02 AM 09:10 Posted: 10/30/2006 Location: Keene (Canada), ON Shape: Circle Duration:10 to 15 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52840.html,"Round white disk flying at low altitude followed by heavy downpour and boat sinking Keene is a small isolated village southeast of Peterborough, Ontario, between Ottawa and Toronto approximately. Keene is the Native location of the Hiawathas of Rice Lake. On May 20 - 21/2006 a Pow Wow was being held at Keene. The dancing was temporarily suspended due to a sudden downpour just after an unidentified flying craft passed overhead. A large private boat sank on Rice Lake close to an island a few minutes later and appeared as a front page article in the Toronto Sun with only some surviving.  Date of Observation - May 21, 2006 Number of Unidentified Craft - One. Relative Position to Me - Directly overhead. Background - The craft was clearly outlined against an intense clear blue sky. Estimated Altitude - 3 to 6 thousand feet. Heading - South. Wind Direction aloft - South. Wind Direction ground - West. Wind Speed Aloft - 30 MPH is an average Wind Speed Ground - 20 - 30 MPH. Visibility - Sky clear but for a few scattered white puffy clouds. No haze. Speed of Craft - 30 MPH and same as surrounding clouds. Action of Craft - ""Nonchalant"" attracting no particular attention while seeming to be ""drifting"" along in perfect time with the surrounding clouds. Weather - Undisturbed, a 95% clear rich blue sky. Location of Sun - High in the sky. Unusual Phenomena - Rain (Occasional squalls before and immediately after).  Appearance of craft - Circular (resembled a four-hole button) + (resembled a paw print with a trailing thinner slipstream). It was making way on a steady course, at a steady speed, making no sounds. Its image was also steady, no shimmering or reflection of sunlight. Contrail - Slightly noticable. Estimated Size of craft - 3 to 5 hundred feet. Colour of craft - Brilliant white with four dark grey circular markings, themselves outlined in a lesser grey tone.  Markings - four dark grey marks on side facing the ground. Shape of marks - circular. Estimated Size of marks - 1/5 the diameter of the craft. Colour of markings - dark grey framed by a much lighter grey edging.  Means of Propulsion - speculate that there are 4 stabilizing jets corresponding with the 4 dark circles on the bottom of the craft. Sound - Nothing heard from overhead  Both witnesses remarked on the craft - one described it as looking like a paw and the second from western Canada indicated that when they appear it is a harbinger of hail.  Recently I found a website containing an image of this craft exact in every way - the image was taken in South Africa in 1963. In this photograph the craft appears to be flying on edge with the four marks facing the photographer from an azumith of about 30 degrees and seems to be making a left bank.  I reported this website via the Internet to a couple of friends shortly after which it no longer could be viewed by this observer (October 8, 2006).  After sending a query to the website it was reinstated and can be found at:  http://www.vgpevidence.org/photographs/section/africa/Photo178.htm  (Subtract one character from each letter preceding ""evidence"" in this address for the correct site address) I have now made several floppy copies of this craft from the website, if it becomes unavailable again I can mail them.  Personal Background I age 66 and retired and educated as a psychologist, a business administrator, a military radio technician and a high school teacher. I have a long background in technical design and analysis for defence projects. Among other things I am a licenced Amateur Radio Operator, I am also an amateur photographer, although I was in the air force, I was not a flier. I am not ever given to going off half cocked and I do look quite carefully and often quadruple check unusual events for logical explanations and often find them. My first witness (looked like a paw) is a level headed surveyor accustomed to using his vision professionally and noting with care. My second witness (harbinger of hail) is more of a passing nature, an out of town visitor whom I asked what he thought of that cloud. Being that I am involved within and without the military troubleshooting complicated electronic equipment and systems, I have developed a keen habit of noting almost everything visual. I use corrective lenses and I was using them at the time. I am diet controlled Diabetic Type II and so was quite in charge of my senses. I know that the ground winds were from the West as the forest was shielding us from the wind in our tents.  There can be no doubt as to the date of this event for a)I have found the debit card record for a purchase of wild rice and b) that the wind and the rain woke me up several times during the night before this sighting. There is absolutely no question in my mind now, that this can be nothing other than a manufactured machine having found a picture of it (now lost but recovered again as we ""speak"") on the website mentioned above.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,44.2395,-78.1612

I called a couple of news stations to see if it may have been reported by anyone else and apparently it had not, I also got on the internet to look up photos of other sightings around the world and I did find a couple that look exactly like the one we saw.

I could not sleep so i walked outside and sat down on the front stoop.I was looking up at the stars in awe of how crystal clear the sky was.Suddenly i saw a pattern of lights moving toward me with incredable speed,the lights were bluish almost the same color as the stars and appeared to be moving around one another.It happened so fast i did not even have time to think about what i was seeing.The pattern of lights came directly over me quite low and as they passed i saw a dark perfect triangle with one bluish white light on each corner.My mouth dropped involuntarily I thought about calling someone from inside the house but i was so stunned i could not speak.The triangle was the fastest moving object i have ever seen(besides a shooting star)and completely silent,no rumble,no breeze.I tried to make sense of what i had seen.I blew it off as a low flying stealth bomber.I told myself that the lights had only appeared to be moving around one another because it had approached my location on its side and flattened out as it passed over.This explanation satisfied me until i described it to my father in the morning.He assured me that a stealth flying that low would have made some sort of sound.Also i do not believe that stealths or even concords can move at that rate.Also the shape and configuration does not match.Even though the event lasted barely 3 or 4 breaths i will never get the image out of my mind.I am happy to find a place to talk about this in a way that is taken seriously.I have sent a second report in of a diffrent nature that happened a bit later.I hope that these reports will help to lend some validity to others that may be similar in nature.I have lived on the outer banks of north carolina for sometime and there are many here who have seen these things in the night sky but very few talk about it.I stopped telling these stories in the face of ridicule and disbelief thank you for providing me a place to lay them to rest..

To which i again laughed at him (He became scared of what he at first thought was a fire fly) I told him to epect that we probably were not alone ,between piracy and visitors ,He interrupted me and told me he didn't believe in any of that shit. I told him that I did and he should.I told him I was not leaving and that we were the hostile ones.We continued fishing.    I was sort of focussing on my line and the water and A SOLID BALL OF LIGHT ,as impressive as the moon,came from in between the island my friend was facing and the next island up,lower then the tops of the the mangrove tree's.   It showed up Quick and quite !  I looked up just as quick and focussed on it and my first thought was"" we're busted"" and I pointed at it and yelled ""God damn that is a bright light for somthing that doesn't make any noise""And it TURNED OFF,   I followed it's path with my fingers waiting for the ""vessel"" to cross the lit up part of the harbour so i could see what it was and there was no vessel where one should have been. Where i was fishing gave me a view from my 1 o'clock to 3 o'clock of the stars touching the lights of the habour in the far distance,,that section of my vision was well lit..Nothing broke my vision of the stars and lights  The ""vessel"" that made a light like that would have to be big enough to be seen with out lights on.    This was a solid ball of light that can only be described as a smaller moon with no face. It did not project light as if to light up the way,,There didn't seem to be a filiment in the center making it brighter in the center  There was no glare off this thing at all and it did not make any sound at all.   We should have heard a vessel befor we saw one.We made sure of it when we chose that location.This thing was on us with the snap of a finger and I got a good look at it.  After yelling to him and pointing at it i said""DID YOU SEE THAT ?""  ""YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT FU__IN BALL OF LIGHT JUST RIGHT THERE ?""  He looked at me and shook his head.Just then my friends big reel started screeming ,We jumped up and he set the hook on somthing big,,We were scrambling around,Iwas moving poles ,pulled the anchor ,raised the motor,,after acouple of minutes we landed this big Searay.We were let down that it was a ray,,Meanwhile we had coasted or blown into the mangrove island to the point where we couldn't use the motor to get out. We had no light to speek of ,all the poles were tangled and the foliage was trying to take things over.We sat there and reflected briefly on the catch.I was back to the light thing and excitedly asked him if he saw it or not and he sort of shook his head no. I asked him what he saw when he thaught he saw fire flies and he said he didn't know and repeated once again that we needed to get out of here. I looked in to the island and focussed my eyes and asked him if he thought someone was on the island and he told me you couldn't get on the island and that there wasn't really any hard surface to stand on like some of the other islands we had seen.I asked him what was behind the island and he said nothing or another island. I asked him why it was lit up towards what seemed to be the middle of the island and he said he didn't know.  i pointed my finger towards the middle and down  and asked him ""Does it seem to you that there is light comming from the island and said there was.....Straight in to the 11oclock and down was lit up but there was no actual light to be seen but it was with out a doubt lit up.....I could see pretty far in there but couldn't see what was causing the light.    My hair stood up and felt like i was somewhere i wasn't safe to be and much to my own surprise was very concerned in getting the boat out of there quick. I had a very strong feeling we were about to be boarded by somthing i couldn't see and grew scared for the first time in years. I wasn't the same person who said he wasn't leaving. We used our net to pole out to open waters and left with our eyes focussed on the illumination coming from under the mangrove island.The Ball of light that I got a good look at came from under and i'm sure out of the other side of the mangrove island.  Not only did I see it but i remember where the island is and I know they were there when we left ,uder the mangrove island.You would need a helicopter to lower you in to the middle of the island with a wet suit on and diving gear to check it out but i'm sure you could get samples off of the vegitation At some point arroundand definately under that part of the island.They have what must be a good spot to bed down in under there or it is an entrance of some kind that they use to surface without being spotted.They travel below the brush line and go between and around the islands and not above to stay un seen.

I looked out of the port hole in my state room and saw 3 what appeared to be lights in a straight line just below the water surface. I made sure all the lights in my state room were off because I wanted to eliminate any reflections. They were keeping pace with the ship and right below my port hole window. After approx. 10 min. they began to head away from the ship as if to go around the bow. I was on the starboard side of the ship and we were headed north by north/east. They headed tword the horizon at  45degrees away from the ship and they were still under water. As they got closer to the horizon I lost sight of them. I continued to look tword the direction they were headed. All of a sudden I saw three lights above the horizon and they were going straight up. They continued to climb straight up for I would say approx. 5000' or 10,000' then they did a hard 90degree left turn parallel the horizon. When I saw then turn the first thing that crossed my mind was ""come back"". When I thought this the three lights (in a straight line) reversed direction at a very rapid speed. The lights then formed a perfect triangle as they appeared to gain altitude from the previous turn. They dissapeared after making the triangle pattern. The time between the hard left turn, and the triangle dissapearing was approx. 25 to 30 seconds. The total time I saw these lights was 25min.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,,

This is quite common due to the good light for observing stars on this part of the beach in Kemptown. Shortly after, we spotted an aeroplane, confirming that it had been a shooting star originally, as the plane was a different height, shape, size, lights etc. The shooting star crossed by another star which then began to fall aswell. This repeated (shooting stars crossing paths of others which then appeared to start 'shooting', until 5 were moving in total. I have no idea what it could have been as I found it unusual to see 5 shooting stars at once like that. They were lower than other stars, but didn't fizzle out or leave any dusty trail like other shooting stars ive seen. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested a correct date for this interesting report.

No sound as they flew directly over us I had the objects in my 10/50 binoculars I could no make out anything other then light I lost sight of them when I pulled my binocular off.   Two fairly-dimmed, whitish lights taking the shape of two corners of a triangle, the top and lower left, appeared in the sky.  They headed towards the zenith at a constant speed which seemed to be that of a normal airplane.  As they came overhead, the lower left light turned red and then back to its orginal white color.  About thirty seconds later the lower left light rotated to the front as if the craft was doing a u-turn or somethin of that nature.  After completing its' rotation, the object continued on its' path towards the zenith.  Continuing to watch it became more and more difficult as the lights faded and eventually visuals were lost.   Two lights that took the form of two-thirds of a triangle (when looking at a triangle, they would be the top and the bottom left points) traveled in tandem and kept a uniform distance from one another.  It would be difficult to say how far apart they were, but roughly a thumb-length was between them when holding one's hand up toward the sky.   They moved in such manner at a moderate pace across the sky.   At one point the bottom light turned red and quickly looped clockwise in a circle.  As soon as this action was performed, the light went back to its original color (a whitish-yellow), returned to its original, uniform place in tandem with the other light (the ""top-point-of-a-triangle"" light), and both continued to move at the same pace, and in the same direction across the sky.  When both lights were back in tandem, however, each began to fade, and both were out of sight within one to two minutes.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,,

My spouse and I were enroute to pick up our child from near the Marina, I noticed an orange light in the sky, but dismissed it as a plane coming across the water from Ontario. But after picking up our child and chatting with our friends for a while, and coming around the corner near the Marina there was something odd about the light – it hadn’t yet passed over – as we arrived at Front Street – it was almost overhead – I stopped the car and had to lean over the dash to see it…I asked my spouse, “do you see that?”, he said “yep”, and to our child he asked “do you see it?”, she replied “yes. Mommy, do you see it?” she asked, I replied, “I sure do”. This bright orange light just sat there not moving – and not making any sort of noise. I can safely saw that the size of the light was the size of a quarter from where we sat. We watched it for a couple of minutes until it seemed to “dim away” as though it was going straight up. I dismissed it as a high end helicopter, the Air Show was scheduled for the following weekend, and we certainly didn’t report it to anyone – who would we call in the first place? The police – what would they do about it? The Airforce? – right – our military has much better things to do with their time...but now this is interesting!",2006-10-30T00:00:00,45.3966,-75.8394

The observers are 2 female college graduates and a female college students.  The person reporting this event was seated in the back seat of the vehicle.  The vehicle was driving on interstate 65, moving toward Chicago.  The event began when the driver of the car sighted what looked like a large fireball was  falling from the sky.  The driver referred to the object as an extremely large meteorite, because the movement of the object and what appeared to be fire surrounding it resembed a meteor entering into the atmosphere.  After the object had fallen for about 1 minute, it came to a complete stop in the sky.  It was a pause of about 10 seconds, and then the single object broke into 5 separate large balls of light and moved into the shape of a pentagon.  The 5 lights moved as one for about another minute, and then they began to fly their separate ways across the sky.  The flight did not seem to have a distinct pattern at this time.  After watching the lights dance across the sky for the next few minutes, trees blocked the line of site of the passengers.  Once the vehicle was beyond the trees, the lights had vanished.  A few minutes down the road, right around reaching Gary, the passengers all noticed a bright light, which put off much more light than an airplane or any other craft the passengers had seen, shoot from the left side of the sky to the right and paused.  This took less than 1 second to occur.  After the light had paused, it lowered altitude, paused for another second, shot straight up into the sky, and was gone.  The passengers of the car all agreed that the object had moved at about the same speed that a ""shooting star"" shoots across the sky.  After this short event, no other lights were spotted by the passengers.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,,

I watched it for a moment and it seemed to stop and hover - I would guess about a mile from where I was standing. It was stationary for about 1 minute then a lighted object dropped from underneath the lighted craft and dropped straight down before looping back up behind the original craft and hovered behind it at the same altitude. I didn't hear any noise or sounds, other than the faint jet engines of the planes approaching LAX to land. The craft then started moving off to the northeast where it dimmed it's lights as it crossed the area where incoming LAX traffic began their approach but then illuminated again after a few seconds. The lighted object that dropped from the craft was still in the same location and I never saw it move, but eventually it just became non visible.

Around 5:00 A.M. saw from a north facing window, just overhead, at an angle 60 to 70 degrees to the horizon, and 30 degree east of due north, two  bright, unusual cloud-like objects. The sky was clear.  The larger object had a central section that was clearly glowing with rainbow colors. Long curlicues extended outward, mostly to the east. These crisscrossed repeatedly. Both objects gradually expanded, the curlicues especially extending over a large distance. Though the edges of the curlicues softened slightly over the next half hour, they maintained their distinctiveness, spreading to cover a vast portion of sky. The smaller object dissipated into a more cloud-like form, while the larger maintained its shape for a much longer time. Both objects were nearly stationary for several minutes, then began a gradual motion to the northeast, as though driven by the wind. Throughout all this time the ends of the curlicues appeared to be extending in length, creating sinuous patterns. The overall impression was of a ""chemical bomb"" slowly expanding and changing. Just after sunrise, around 6:20, the objects had almost completely dissipated, and were now far to the northeast, but could still be faintly seen covering almost the whole of the northern horizon, having expanded from a very tight center just over or to the north of Silver City to include the whole visible extent of the Gila Wilderness area. Note: the next day the news was full of reports that what observers had seen was the result of a successful antiballistic missile test over the White Sands testing area. However, White Sands is east of Silver City, and this phenomenon looked to be more to the north, over the Gila Wilderness area. Photos of this event were taken by the observers and others.

What attracted my attention was the fact that the object was not showing signs of a commercial craft as it was not on the normal course that commercial flights take into Philladelphia, the blue light was not pulsating but was instead constant.  Also, at one point in it's progress, the object stopped and remained unmoving for a period of perhaps 8 - 10 seconds before continuing.

He looked into the sky and said oh that's probably a meteor Andrew( the ship was going down). Then the ship started to move up in the air and he said"" now it's moving up"". He continued to say their was a air base near by and it was probably a plane. About 10 minutes later after seing the Ship move left to right and up and down he agreed that this was no man made craft unless it was top of the line secret projects. Not to long from then we noticed more space craft in the area spread all over. In all i saw about 9 Ship's at one time over the beach.

This was around 10:15 p.m. and we set the chairs up to face out over the ocean to get a good view of the moon rising.   We sat there for several minutes observing the sky as it was a clear, cloudless night.   We carried on a casual conversation as we tried to identify constellations and planets, and two of us even caught a shooting star.  Then, suddenly, around 10:30, I pointed up at the sky because a bright orange light had just appeared.  It was stationary for probably 5 seconds and then, almost like a firework, six more (though i'm not sure it was exactly six) orange lights emerged from the first light.  In fact, my first reaction was that it was a firework.  However, the lights did not descend, but instead remained in a ""V-like"" formation for a few additional seconds.  My friends and I immediately discussed whether it could be some strange firework, but came to the conclusion that it could not be for three reasons:   1)  The small number of lights and their duration were unlike any firework we had ever seen;  2)  There was a firework show going on a few miles up the beach, and it was neither as bright nor did the tallest firework reach a quarter of the height of the orange lights; and  3)  The lights were directly over the ocean and would have had to been fired from the water. It was then suggested that it was an airplane, but we didn't think it could be that.  Firstly, it didn't move or act like an airplane; the sudden movements and sudden appearance of lights were unlike any airplane I have seen before.  And secondly, airplanes have red, green, and white lights while this aircraft had a single, bright orange light.  After several minutes of discussion, some of the lights suddenly appeared again, this time all at once and slightly south of their original position.  It did not appear, however, that the lights were all on the same shit as they seemed to move independantly, sometimes blinking and a few of them oscillating a bit. The final time we saw them was several more minutes later, much further down the beach.  They behaved in the same way, but appeared to have picked up speed.  They were only visible for a few seconds, and that was the last we saw of them.  The event has perplexed me as that same night I witnessed a shooting star, fireworks, a definite plane, and what we thought might even be a satelite- yet this was something completely different than any of those or anything I have ever seen.   Perhaps they were just fighter jets, but it didn't seem like it to me.  The unusual lights and the sporadic appearances have left me wondering what the source of these lights might have been.  After this, the moon had risen and my friends didn't share the same interest in the lights as I did and do, so we left the beach, but since that point i have been looking for some explanation.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,33.4425,-79.1588

Suddenly after being still for a few minutes the object moved backwards quickly, did a circle, moved to the left and started to become more distant. The object moved away awkwardly. It was moving up and down. Really weird. Later, we saw 5 of them they were further away then the one seen before. They were all on the same side of the sky, as well. THey resembled stars even more. They were still for a bit then one by one or two at a time they started moving away to the right, all in the same direction. As they moved they did not travel straight they moved up and down slightly as the one before did as well. These objects were definitely not planes, because there were planes in the sky and they moved and looked very different. Plus, planes do not move up and down and do weird loop-d-loop things, nor do they stand still for a few minutes then move rapidly away. I swear this is true I am not even one to totally believe in UFO's. It was so weird. Oh and at one point it was like a fireball, and was stationary, then suddenly would start moving away and didn't look like a fireball anymore but more like a plane, but obviously different.

RE-TYPED REPORT:   May 18, 2008   TO:  National UFO Reporting Center   Hi!   Not much to explain, but is much different, much earlier, than anything I’ve ever heard about UFO’s. Been trying, at times, to figure out whom to tell this to for many years.  Looked to National  Enquirer years ago.  Asked them for an address to write to explain what we saw. They gave me the address in photocopy, which as you can see was undeliverable.  So forgot about it until a UFO presentation on TV tonight.  Have a computer, but am not very proficient at it, but found your address.  The letter I wrote 1990 was returned and have never been opened.  Is still sealed. Here goes!  I am 83 and my brother is 88.  We saw this in approximately 1934.  We were in the country on our family farm 6 miles east of Valley City, ND. It was in open country ¼ mile from the farm in the afternoon about 3-4 p.m..  The sky had high overcast, no wind, very quiet.  We were at an old gravel pit, checking for badger holes. We heard a rushing sound which got our attention.  Looking up, we saw the object moving from southeast to northwest. They were out of sight in seconds.  To me, they seemed to be perfectly round, black.  I likened them to be like a bowling ball in size, very, very close, very low (had to be low to be able to hear the rushing sound, as they passed by), as low as 50 feet, side by side, equidistant apart.  Not quite overhead, but off to the west of us. My brother says they disappeared in the clouds.  I disagree.  I say they disappeared in the distance. I am a private pilot, so I know a little more about cloud conditions.  The clouds went much too high.  They disappeared in a straight, ascending attitude.  Ascending in about a 10-15 degree attitude.  Was very slight. That’s the story, for what it’s worth!  Much can be said yet about it because we had nothing like this experimentally.  Am quite certain, way back then.  Didn’t even have much flying, yet. This is not a hoax!  This did happen!!  If you have any questions, better get at it while our minds are still good!

This story was related to me by my first cousins once removed at my great-aunt's (their mother's) funeral.  It occurred during their childhood in rural Neshoba County, Mississippi.  Both are Air Force veterans and solid citizens.  I have absolutely no reason to doubt their word.  According to the observers (who are twin boys), they were about seven or eight years old, and out of school for the summer.  The rural mail carrier delivered the mail to their home somewhat near the end of his route, and usually arrived after 3:00 p.m.  Their home was located approximately 100 yards up a gravel driveway from the main roadway, also a gravel road at the time.  The twins heard the mailman approach the mailbox, stop, and then accelerate off to the next home down the road.  They asked their mother if they could go down to the mailbox and get the mail.  She allowed them to go.  They walked the 100 yards or so down to the mailbox, retrieved the mail and headed back towards the house.  When they were approximately half way up the drive (50 yards from their home), my great-aunt began yelling for them to ""run, run!"" in an urgent tone.  They ran towards her.  When they arrived at the front porch of their home, my great-aunt pointed towards the woodline on the other side of a field approximately 4-500 yards from their home.  Silently hovering over the woodline was a very large silvery disk, perhaps 100-200 feet or larger in circumference.  They observed the disk hover for approximately another four or five minutes.  It then took off at a very high rate of speed, accelerating as it gained in altitude.  It was out of sight in only a few seconds, and was entirely silent. My cousins told me that they were in awe of the object but, being children, they quickly resumed playing and had only the vaguest memory of both the object and the event for many years.  While reminiscing at a Thanksgiving dinner many years later (in the mid-1990s), my great-aunt questioned them both to see if they remembered the event.  They both recalled the event and had virtually identical recollections.   An older brother who was a test engineer at the Nevada Test Site until his retirement also recalled that the story was related to him shortly after it happened in the early 1950s. I am not aware of any other witnesses, nor am I aware of any graphic images such as photos, movies, etc., that exist of the incident.  If you need further details, feel free to contact me.

I lived in Manville, Rhode Island. I had been acting up, and my mother sent me upstairs to my room as punishment. I wanted to be outside playing with my friends, but here I was stuck in my room looking out the window, feeling sorry for myself.  I was there for some time. Outside my window stood a large elm tree, and its first branches were above the roof of the 2 story house. Some of the leaves on the branches partly obscured some of my view. About the 9 to 12 o'clock position. The rest of the sky was cloudless and blue from the 12 o'clock position to about 3 o'clock. From 3 o'clock there were houses on the near hill side, and finally down to the 4 o'clock position was the roof of the next door neighbors home that was about 50 feet away. I was looking south. From behind one of the houses on the hill, appeared first one colored light, then several more. They were moving in a group of about a dozen lights, evenly spaced. Each light, was a different color. Each light being about the size of a pencil eraser end at arms length. The group was about the size of a soccer ball held at arms length. The lights didn't blink, the colors they were, remained steady. Orange, green, red, and one or two almost white. They were moving from the south to the north. I watched in silent amazement. The group moved across the blue sky, then behind some of the elm leaves and again they appeared in a patch of blue sky and then disappeared behind more leaves and were gone. During the 50's planes made noise.........a lot of noise.  We were directly under the flight path of four engine planes flying to Boston's Logan airport 60 miles to the northeast.  You not only heard the planes go by, but you felt them.  The noise would vibrate though you.  There was no traffic in the nearby street at the time I was watching the lights only a few birds chirping here and there.  It was this thought that filled me with fear.  What I had just witnessed passed by without a single sound, nothing!   As the fear built up in me, crying I ran down the stairs to tell my mother.  I think she thought I was putting on a performance, to be let out.  She comforted me, and sent me outside.  I didn't want to go, but she insisted.  I then sat on the porch, looking up at the sky thinking about what I had just seen.",,41.9679,-71.4759

My son and I were tenting for the night at the U.S. Forest Service's public campground at Big Sandy Opening, Wind River Range, Bridger National Forest.   I had been awakened by the sound of a large animal, possibly an elk, moose, or bear  fording the river about 75 to 100 yards away and got up to see what it was.  My son joined me.   Never saw the animal, but started looking up at the night sky.  It was clear and the stars were bright.  There was a waning moon rising.   Two other objects caught our attention.  One seemed to hover over the south end of the range and the other, off to the left, appeared to be over the central part of the Wind River Mountains.   At first glance  they both looked like stars or planets.  However, both ""danced"" around a bit, entirely unlike every thing else in the night sky.  These two lights did not act like airplanes.  And the Mountains over which these appeared are over 13,000 feet above sea level, so it was doubtful they where helicopters.   There was no sound except the nearby stream and occasional sounds of wildlife moving around in the willows down by the bridge.  The two odd lights both rapidly changed color; red to blue, to white, to ornge, over and over in very short repetitions.   Now, weeks later, I can't be sure what order the colors appeared in.  But it was very strange.  We watched for about half an hour, until we just got too tired.  We had a big day hike planned for later that morning, and needed to get some sleep.  I thought it was a curious coincidence that we had been told the day before that there were no motel rooms available in nearby Pinedale, Wyoming, because of a U.S. Air Force conference taking place there that week.  I have no idea what it was we saw, but my first guess would be some experimental man made aircraft.  I don't personally believe in space alliens visiting earth and all that nonsense.

My husband and I were driving westbound on highway 54 towards the village of Dexterville (central Wisconsin) in the cranberry bogs.  It was dark (10:08 pm), when suddenly, just to the left, we saw a very bright set of multiple lights ahead of us.  They had suddenly appeared out of nowhere and were very large, guessing approximately 6 blocks above.  The lights were shaped in a curved like boomerang or curved triangle shape.  We could not see an object because of the darkness, but these lights very clearly were outlining something.  The lights seemed to glide slowly to the right, as if the object was moving very slowly.  The distance was much, much lower than an airplane would fly, yet, still off the ground some distance.  The lights were white, but my afterthought recollection remembers some hue of orange.  The lights appeared to suddenly begin to fade away as the group of lights in unison, tilted to the right, and amazingly, it was gone as fast as it appeared, it seemed to simply fade away.   We kept looking, thinking that it had to still be there, but could not see a thing.  After it disappeared, we realized there were several star-like lights, much smaller, moving very quickly, higher up in the sky in a tight circular pattern.  Very shortly, we came to a train crossing by a small dirt road on our left & pulled off the road and got out of our vehicle.  We heard multiple jet noises and realized that these 5 star-like objects which were moving very fast, were fighter jets, as we watched them for several minutes.  They  kept circling above, just to the left, where we saw the object, at a much lower altitude. My husband and I both agree that we have never seen anything like this before.  The whole experience as short as it was, is very incredible.  I called the Wood Co. sherrifs department when we got home about 30 minutes later, to tell them about the episode.  They said they had not received any other reports.  I am interested to see if anyone else experienced what my husband and I saw.  Wow!",2006-10-30T00:00:00,,

I guess I've always held an interest in strange things . . . just wanted to know if you've ever seen anything.""  As his story unfolded he told me it was a few years after he'd gotten the farm - he purchased it in 1957 with help from the DVA. As I recall, he told me some of his cows had failed to return to the barn this evening. He was concerned because some of them were with calf and he felt that perhaps a calf had been injured and the cow (s) would not leave it. He decided to walk into the field and search his 400+ acres - all of it if need be.  He recalled walking north into the moon-lit night. He'd walked for about 15 minutes barking ""Co-Boss!"" He'd stop from time to time to listen, said he'd wipe his forehead with a hanky because it was a warm, humid night. He'd continue.  He said he'd walked for 15 minutes or so in the manner described above, and had paused to listen and look around. He said while looking around he noticed a bright light coming out of the north east. He said it was flying in a line that would cross in front of him, it was low just over tree-top level. He listened for the sound of an engine. As he listened and the object closed he noticed the light was bluish in color. When I asked him what type of blue he said it was the type of blue one sees when looking at an arc-welder's flash.  He stood there listening intently for an engine, but there was no sound. He said the object passed almost over him, but remained slightly to his front with, again, not a sound to be heard. His curiosity kept his eyes fixed on the object until it became obscured by the tree line to the south west. After he lost sight of it his curiosity shifted to fear.  I asked him what he did then. He said, ""I wasn't long getting back to the house!"" He said he watched the thing for a good 20/30 seconds. He said he had no idea what it was. I asked him why he was scared. He said because it hadn't made a sound and he'd never seen anything like it. He said it had what looked like a fuzzy glow around it - blue. I suspect the fuzzy look may have been enhanced by the humidity of that night.  Interestingly, he said he was paid a visit by a couple ""G-men"" (his word, not mine) a week or two afterward. They said they were there to check out his property for some minerals. He let them onto his property then let them wander about. Upon their return he asked them if they'd found anything. I interrupted, ""What did they find?"" He answered, ""I'm not sure, but the one guy said it made his Geiger counter sing."" I have done some research on the minerals in this area and there is indeed uranium here. I can't say the arrival of the G-men played any part of the old gent's sighting - he'd not told anyone at that time about it.  I verily feel his account of this incident was exactly as he experienced it. He was dead serious and uneasy recalling it - something (the uneasiness) I'd not seen him project in my 5 years of knowing him.

I just looked up. It was a very large circular craft with coloured lights in the middle revolving round. The thing I will never forget is the noise it was making like a humming noise.

I woke up in the middle of night and found myself alone in the house!  It was dark.  I looked out the window and into the neighbor's kitchen.  Saw a being there, facing my neighbor, and the neighbor was seated.  The being had something in his hand, and when he jutted it toward my neighbor, my neighbor jerked, like being shocked.  I gasped.  The being immediately turned and looked at me.  I ran and did the only thing I could think of...I tried to hide under my bed.  But the bed was low to the ground and I could only get my head and shoulders under it.  It was too heavy for me to lift.  I was terrified.  I waited and then heard soft footsteps on the wood floor.  The being was in the house.  It came to the door and I believe stood in the door looking at me.  I fainted. Have written in detail a number of times, only to never hear back from anyone.  There are other events too:   1. My mother had an encounter, possibly that same night. 2. My mother saw a cigar-shaped craft. 3. My mother and I were on a trip together and both lost about 2 hours of time on the trip. 4. I had dental x-rays that showed a piece of metal in the front of my mouth below the teeth, in the gums.  A few years later another x-ray was taken that showed nothing. 5. I saw 5 football-shaped craft with stubby wings, flying in a circle. 6. I saw 5 ""stars"" high in the sky one night in Montana.  There were 4 in corners and one in the center.  They moved together in formation. 7. Another incident that defies category.  I was camping in a car overnight.  Everyone in the campground had seemingly disappeared.  There were cars and campers but no people.  Fog, I felt drugged, something was outside.  The car lights seemed dim and yellowish. 8. ""weather balloon"" hovering over my schoolyard.  It appeared to be a spherical paper-white craft (unlike any weather balloon, but that is what we were told).

My friend and I were driving to his house some night in the middle of July when we saw a flying object much like the Phoenix lights. I made a comment on how strange it looked and how low it was flying. We slowed down and watched the lights until they were out of sight and then almost instantly forgot about them. Both of us don't actually believe in UFO's so it was easy to put out of our minds. But tonight when I saw that show it made me wonder.

I could trace them for about three minutes before losing them - as if they had become too distant to see without any equipment.

My dad worked for NASA during the 60's and 70's and we often looked up at the sky at night to look for satellites. The event took place one night as I looked at the sky. I guess I was about 10 years old, I was on our front porch by myself and I spotted a satellite or so I thought. It did not look any different from all the others I had seen except for the fact that it changed course. I distinctly remember watching as this spec of light approached another spec of light which I assume was a star or planet. I realized of course that the satellite is circling the earth and would pass in front of this other spec of light. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. The spec of light I thought was a satellite went around the other spec of light. It made a perfect half circle around the planet or star and continued on its original path. My mother was near the door and I called for her to see it. She got to the door in time to see it finishing it's half circle.  Both the star or planet, and what I thought was a satellite seemed to be about the same size. So this UFO had to be about the same size as the planet or star. Also it was moving at about the same speed as a satellite would move across the sky. Given it was on the same plane as the planet or star it had to be moving at an incredible rate of speed to appear to be moving at the same speed as a satellite circling the earth.  I hope this helps.

This is my encounter; My then girl friend (wife now) lived at ((address deleted)) Rosemont Ave, La Jolla, California, which is right off the beach.  On Sunday night, October 17, 1965, at 7:15PM, we were walking along the edge of the beach only 1 block from our apartment- We were very startled and amazed, when suddenly there came into view 4 flying saucers, going southbound, about 1/4 mile inland and less than ¼ mile in height.. They were flying fast in a diagonal  formation, were definitely piloted, each gently and separately undulating up and down as though slightly buffeted by the wind.  They emitted no lights and made not a single perceptible sound. We had been easily hearing birds chirping in the distance, but no engine sound or even a sound of airflow was perceptible, and the day was bright and clear and otherwise quiet. We were just out of earshot of the sound of waves hitting the beach.  These vehicles were not birds, not balloons, airplanes, not swamp gas, not temperature inversions, not kites, not anything but saucer-shaped vehicles. There could be no way we could be mistaken as everything was mid-day clear close view. My eyes happened to concentrate on the under rim of the saucers I saw a dark brown colored rim on the underside of the saucers of perhaps 2 feet in width. The vehicles otherwise were approximately the color of aluminum, I saw 3 hemispheric undercarriages spaced circularly at 120 degrees apart. I saw portholes. My girl friend's vision happened to concentrate on the top most portion and she saw yellow light in the port holes. They flew past us at perhaps 350 miles per hour and we had them in view maybe 6 seconds in all. They were less than 1/4 mile from us at the closest point. Based on the angle subtended by the vehicles and my estimate of the distance to them, I would make an educated guess that their sizes were about 150 feet in diameter each and perhaps 20 feet in height not counting the height of their undercarriages. They flew in the direction of the San Diego Airport and seemed to be totally unconcerned at being seen or if it was a danger to them. They appeared to be their own masters. I phoned the San Diego Airport, the! Miramar Naval Station and informed them as well as the local police. The police told me they had not received any calls thus far. Miramar Naval Station recorded my phone conversation but would not answer as to whether there were any other witnesses. After this encounter, my friend and I found a book in the library called ""Flying Saucers and Outer Space"", written maybe in 1955, On one page there was a drawing of a flying saucer   As soon as we saw it, we both said to each other ""that is just what we saw"". Mind you, prior to this, I and my friend had thought that those who said they saw flying saucers were seeing things by mass hallucinations, and gave these reports no credence at all. And neither of us had read a book at all on this subject. My girl friend became very frightened at this incident, and I, foolishly wished they would have just stopped and taken me aboard for a ride. But, having worked as a Mechanical Engineer in the Space industry for 20 years, and being well up on every flying vehicle known to man, for one thing I know of no vehicle now or even contemplated, that can fly without a very noisy engine to power it. If there was a noiseless engine it would have been put to very good use a long time ago, for example on the very expensive Concord Aircraft, which was only allowed to fly over uninhabited areas because of the incredibly loud noise it made. From this fact and my general feelings about this I must conclude (the U.S. government and any nay-sayers not withstanding) that these vehicles are of a very very advanced stage of technology and that they are not of this earth.

We were both in the seventh grade at the time.  My brother, who’s a jokester, was sitting on the rail of our back porch talking to us through the screen door.  All of a sudden he looked up into the still sunny sky and said, “Look, flying saucers!”  My friend dropped her dish towel onto the counter and dashed out the door to take a look.  Being my brother was always horsing around, I didn’t believe him and told my friend not to believe him either.  Well she was out the door already, and when she looked up she shouted back to me, “Yeah, come look, flying saucers, for real!”  I rushed out the door, which took about 5 seconds to do, and looked up into the sky and saw two saucer shaped objects, hovering above our house.  They looked to be about 30-35 feet above us. There were no wings or tail extended like an airplane or helicopter.  There were no noises or sounds that we could hear.  It was gray in color with one red and one pink light blinking from its underside.  I quickly ran through our little house, from the back porch, through the kitchen, the dining room, and into the living room where my mother was.  I shouted for her to come and see the “flying saucers”, and ran back out to the back porch.  In about 5 seconds of getting there, the two objects silently lifted into the sky and zipped out of sight in a matter of a second or so!  As quickly as I can zip my cursor from one end of my monitor screen to the other, is how I would describe the UFO’s course of action.  I am 55 years of age now, and can still, vividly remember that afternoon like it was yesterday.  Anytime the subject of UFO’s or flying saucers come up in our presence, my brother and I look at each other and laugh, then we’ll say, ""We know, we saw some!""

One Friday summer night in June, we ate dinner and spent a relaxing evening playing cards and watching TV at my wife’s sister’s house across town. Very late, probably around one am, we drove back to my parents’ home near the city limits. Just as we approached, a bright light three blocks away attracted our attention.  This being the neighborhood where I had grown up, I assumed the floodlight was from an Edison power crew working on a large transformer that sat in a fenced-off corner of Congress Street and Owendale and located at one end of land owed by the school district. Since we were still wide awake, we continued on to investigate.  To our astonishment, there  was no  Edison truck. Instead, the floodlight came from directly above the treetops. Its light source was a circular-shaped craft outlined by pulsating colored lights and hovering silently perhaps thirty feet or so over the power station. I remember shouting to my son asleep in  the back  seat and  trying to wake him. (He was only four and remembers  little of it  today.)  Certainly aware that the three occupants of a VW beetle posed no threat, the craft slowly lifted above treetop level and silently accelerated about a quarter mile over the trees  lining the road when it abruptly stopped, almost as though it  waited for us to catch up.  Of course I tried. When I drew near, the craft raced another quarter mile or so and again stopped just above tree level. It repeated this strange “catch us if you can’’ maneuver a  final time. Then suddenly it rose. I remember jumping out of  the car  and watching as the craft  accelerated and merged with  the stars. The entire encounter was over in probably two or three minutes.  We hurried home, burst into my  sleeping parents’ bedroom, awakened them, and  shared our experience. My Mom believed us; my dad, probably not. What I do know is that my wife and I had encountered and tried  to chase an  extra- terrestrial craft one early morning. And as long as I live, I will never forget the experience.",,42.23633504273504,-83.60297037037037

I was staring at the constellation Cassiopeia and then turned my attention behind me, to the south west, where a very bright star was...maybe Jupiter, not sure. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something moving from right to left..which would have been exactly in a southerly direction. Naturally, automatically i tried to see what it was and soon found a black, boomerang shaped object moving, very steadily across the sky. It had no lights and no visible features and disappeared out of sight, in a very weird kind of fading manner. It is like it flickered out. It was completely silent. The size is very hard to estimate. Since it was black I could not judge the distance or the size. My BEST estimate would be about the length of a football field from end to end. It was moving very straight. My best guess is that it would have been flying directly over the St Johns River, right on the eastern shore, moving southward. Im a few locks from the river, on University blvd W., between San Jose blvd and Powers avenue. A few days later, I went online to see if anything had ever been talked about. I googled ""boomerang ufo"" and got scared with what I found. This is EXACTLY what it looked like, except it was night time and much darker. The other thing, the most significant was this website: www.cassiopaea.org/cass/boom.htm I imagine it is a coincidence that I was staring at Cassiopaea just prior to this since I stare at constellations all the time and it was the only one visible in that direction at that time of night due to the trees on that side of my yard. But...it strikes me as odd, that I REMEMBER having been staring at that specific constellation and secondly of course, that the only time in my life I have ever seen anything like this (a UFO) was immediately upon turning away from looking at it. Please, if you can, read what that website says about contact from the constellation.  I have always been agnostic but open to these things. I am a sane, normal, everyday person that never ever thought it would happen to me...as the story goes..as Ive heard people say. If you have questions, I would be happy to answer them. I could go on about the psychological nature of the experience, which in itself, was unique, but I will leave that open if you wish to ask. Im very glad this is possible to share.

Two dad's drove up later that night to pick up the boys and their equipment to bring them back home.  Our son and two other band members were going to ride home in my car. Incidentally, the other driver headed back home ahead of us as we had several musical instruments, amplifiers and speakers to load into my vehicle.  Shortly after leaving the area, we were back on the main highway, with mostly farmland between Rockford and Freeport.  There was very little traffic at that time and after driving for almost 15-20 minutes, I noticed in the rear view mirror, an extremely bright light coming up behind us on the highway.  I mentioned that to the boys and then stated that it was probably a motorcycle and I wished he would turn off his bright light and flip the dimmer switch. The blinding light continued to remain behind the car for several additional minutes and I couldn't believe the incredible brightness coming from this one single light.  Within a few moments, the light disappeared and I assumed the ""rider"" had turned off or stopped. However, in the next couple of minutes, the quietness within the car was broken when one of the boys sitting in the back seat literally shouted ""Look outside, next to the road!""  The brilliant round light was now moving parallel to the car, alongside the road on the passenger side, actually following the contour and swales on the ground.  I couldn't judge how close it was to the car, but I imagined about 20-30 yards from the highway.  It was an amazing sight and our ""parallel"" visitor continued on for at least three or four minutes, staying alongside our car at a speed of about 60 miles per hour.   The next thing to happen was even more unbelievable as the brilliant round object slowly tipped sideways and then accelerated at an incredible speed into the darkness and disappeared.  The boys were really shaken up by this wild incident and I thought I should stop at the Illinois State Police Headquarters a few miles down the road, but they wanted to get straight home.  The UFO story was never reported, but there are four of us ""earthlings"" that will never forget that summer night and the encounter with a truly unidentified flying object. I wish a Camcorder was available at that time as it would have been more than newsworthy to quite a few individuals, maiinly the United States Air Force.  (The typical skeptical answer of ""It had to be a weather balloon"" will definitely not be accepted by this adult and his three witnessess.

We BS'd outside for a few more minutes before we realized that the object hadn't moved in the sky (or atleast not enough to be a plane).  We got our camera with a high powered lense, and were able to get a better view.  The object was undoubtably saucer shaped, with a red light that was traveling around the object, and a blue light that appeared to be stationary at top.  The red light was very prodominant every time it circled around the object.  The longer we watched the object, we realized it was starting to move West.  It moved West, a really really long ways for almost 45 minutes, to the point that it was getting a bit more difficult to see, but the strange thing is the red light was still very prominant.  You could tell it was a red light (looking like blinking now) but it was thousands of miles away at this point.  The object then changed course and started heading north.  It was obviously too far away to really see it moving from looking at it.  But we used landmarks (trees, other objects) to be able to tell when the object was staying still, or moving in a particular direction. I know of no aircraft that is known to the public that can produce the results that we saw tonight.  Hopefully someone else saw it !!!!

It was moving to the south (over and parallel to Freeway 5, perhaps?) close to the same speed and altitude as most local small aircraft traffic (I am just a few miles from PDX). It was not what most would call a spectacle. It was black, had a diamond shape with four rounded edges and had no lights, no visible features (tail, landing gear, windows) and it produced no audible sound. The sun was setting at the time and the sunlight on the bottom western edge of the object produced a warm orange glow on the surface despite being black. It left me with sense that the object had a matte rather than a high-metalic surface. My friends and I agreed that the object was not a plane or a helicopter. We considered the possibility it was a baboon. The wind was mild and steady and coming from the Northwest. The object was moving more directly to south, It follows, the winds aloft would have to have been moving in a somewhat different direction than the wind on the ground - and I realize this is very possible. I could just about cover the object with the tip of my index finger at arms length. And from this vantage point in could most certainly have been a diamond shaped balloon.

I also remember my uncle standing in front of me but not moving or speaking. It seemed as though he was frozen in time; I kept pulling at his shirt trying to get his attention but he didn’t move.  The next thing I remember is touching some kind of machine with lights all around it and it was very cold. From what I can gather now thinking back it seemed to me to be a probe of some kind.

This event happened long ago, but it is as if it happened just yesterday. I was just fifteen years old at the time. Here is my terrifying experience! My twin brother was in the hospital which was located only a few blocks from my home. My aunt who lived across the street from me at the time wanted me to go with her so that she wouldn't be alone. My aunt was deaf so she didn't feel comfortable going by herself. We arrived at the hospital about 7:15pm. My aunt and I visited my brother for about 1-1/2 hours. At about 8:45pm when the sun was just about down we were on our way back home when all of the sudden something caught my eye in the northern sky. I looked up and saw two huge lights. The object was about 400-500 feet up in the air and as it started to pass over us I notice that it looked like an old World War II airplane. It was not what it appeared to be. First, there was no noise at all. It also seemed to be floating across the sky very slowly. It was NOT a blimp! If this was an airplane I surely would have heard something and if the airplane was flying that low it certainly would be moving much faster then the speed it was moving. When I seen this and realized this object was not what it appeared to be I became so frightened. I have never been so scared in my life before then or since. Anyway, I looked down because I didn't want to see this thing anymore. I grabbed my aunt's hand and tried to run, but she would not run. I couldn't leave her behind so I just held on to her hand tight and held my breath because I just knew we were going to be picked up by this craft. After what seemed forever I looked up and the object was gone. My aunt and I made it home alright and I told my family what happened, but they thought I was just seeing things. As far as my aunt goes, she didn't run because she couldn't hear and what she seen was an airplane to her although she did say that it seemed strange that it was moving so slow. She was also puzzled. After this happened I always closed my curtains in my bedroom and tried to stay inside when dusk came. I always felt that they would come back for me. I know this sounds crazy, but this event did happen. Thank you for letting me share my unforgettable experience with you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We were astounded however when it suddenly took off at an amazing speed and we followed its flight until it went out of sight.

We moved toward the back yard (which was a small field) in order to see it better.  It started to decend right over us, like it saw us looking at it.  It got larger and larger but there was no way to really judge the size or how close it was, but it seemed bigger than the neighbor's house. It decended slowly and blocked out the stars in the sky. It felt like it was right on top of us.  Then, without warning, the Object shot straight up in the sky at a speed that was astounding. It became the size of a Softball and bright white in the sky.  It stopped and angled right and zipped away so fast that you could only follow it for a few seconds. Then it was gone.  A minute or so later, we heard and saw several 'Airforce Jets' from 'Pease Airforce Base' flying in the same direction the object retreated.

The weather conditions at the time of sighting were like any crisp winter night. The moon was waning (although it was perhaps oddly well lit outside) there was minimal cloud clover and the air was still, no wind or rain. I was brushing my hair before going to sleep, when I heard something like the noise of an approaching aircraft. Only, it didn't sound like a jet engine - it was of a indescribable, strange pitch and more thunderous... strange enough to give me the heebie jeebies. Given that there's a flight curfew in Adelaide between 11 PM - 5 AM, and the sound it made was so odd, I went to look out the window in time to see it almost right overhead. It wasn't very high up, and I could see it was shaped like a backwards triangle with rounded corners.  There were two steady clear, blue-white lights with a pulsating red tail light on the underbelly of the craft, but there was enough light outside for me to make out the shape of whatever it was. There was no nose - it was literally a triangle. It was bizarre enough for me to get a chill down my spine and I was contemplating reaching for my phone to take a photo, when it just disappeared! I could hear it but I couldn't see it, even though my line of sight in the direction it was going was unblocked. I should've been able to see it with no problem. I can only assume it went above a cloud - but like I said, it wasn't at a high altitude, and it wasn't cloudy last night. I am not located near any airports or air force bases. Besides, it was well past the aforementioned curfew. In addition, I noticed afterwards that the air seemed to be charged with static.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,,

At first I thought it to be some sort of star, but as it started to fade away (there was no horizontal or vertical movement just fading) another object started to fade in to its right. Then that faded and at the same time, another object was fading in downward to its right. Then that faded, as it faded, two lights faded in next to it. Once those lights faded there was nothing else. A few days ago I had seen footage a man took of the pheonix lights three hours before they showed up to most people, and these UFOs or this UFO took the same fading in and out pattern as that but it was the opposite direction of fading.

I have never before seen a ufo, and have always been skeptical of them, having felt that there must be mainly psychological forces involved in such experiences, rather than technological ones.  I recently moved back to Lincoln, and have been staying with my parents while looking for a place of my own.  Some weeks ago I had a dream in which an otherworldly craft flew over the house while I was alone on the front porch.  In the dream I called my mother out to witness the thing with me so that at least someone would believe what I had seen.  Then, several nights before the sighting described below, I stumbled upon a video of a 2001 press conference given at the National Press Club in Washington, DC by Dr. Greer and The Disclosure Project, and was stunned by the information presented there by him and his 21 government, military, intelligence community, and corporate witnesses.  This testimony shattered my preconceived notions about ufos--indeed my entire worldview--and forced me to admit that I likely have been a victim of disinformation my entire life.  I was still reeling from what I had learned from this video, and was weighing telling my parents about it as we sat on their front porch on the night of July 21, when my father said ""there's a ufo.""  He is a level-headed retired journalist who coincidentally spent years as a member of the National Press Club working as an award-winning White House Press Photographer under the Nixon administration.  I saw that he was joking about an airplane flying nearby, but his comment gave me the opportunity to broach the subject of The Disclosure Project press conference and tell the two of them that I thought it likely that we world citizens had been lied to for generations about the reality of extraterrestrial visitation.  It was a difficult thing for me to do, as I am a rational person and was risking my credibility, but I feel that this is supremely important information that everyone needs to hear.  The three of us had an interesting conversation in which my parents expressed their own doubt about the official ufo story, and generally we all just soaked up this astounding revelation without waxing overly dramatic about it.  Some time later my mother went up to bed and my father and I stayed up talking.  Just after 11 pm, as if it had been summoned as verification of my earlier assertions, a glowing, bluish-white object about the apparent size of a pea held at arm's length, brighter than anything else in the sky, appeared about 20 degrees above the horizon (below the clouds) almost due south of us, glowing brightly and streaking rapidly westward at a 30 degree downward angle.  I said ""do you see that?"" and my father replied ""I'm looking at it"" in a stupefied tone.  The object (I call it an object rather than a light because it was a sharply-defined ovoid shape with no flames, rays, or tail) shot in a straight line toward the horizon and disappeared behind the buildings a few hundred feet south of us, absolutely soundlessly.  It seemed to be about a half-mile or so distant, though it was difficult to tell with certainty.  There was no explosion or flash of light at the time the object should have hit the ground, had it been a meteor, comet, or other sort of space debris.  I asked my dad if we shouldn't call the local papers and tv stations the next day to see if anyone had reported anything.  The veteran journalist replied ""why would we do that?  They wouldn't tell us anything we don't already know.""  A man of few words, he paused for a second or two and then said ""that was what you would call 'a classic ufo'.""  He later admitted he'd never seen anything like it before.  The next day he joked, ""the ufo people were listening to our conversation,"" with his typical dry humor, but who knows--is that so unlikely?  Just two or three minutes after the sighting I took out my PDA and recorded detailed notes, which formed the basis of this report.  By the way, the animation on your site provided by a witness to a March 19 sighting in Seattle is very similar to what my father and I saw.

There was no clouds in the sky, no moon was visible (it's always in the opposite direction anyway), and no wind. It was about 85 degrees (F).  Suddenly & seemingly from out of no where, a goldish circular light appeared in the sky. It was about 1/3 the size of a full moon when it's highest in the sky. It was an intense (but easy to look at) soft gold color, that seemed to be pulsing on the outer circumfrence of the object, which had no visible defined edge. No other shape within or without the object was visible. There was total silence as is moved laterally & slowly in a westerly direction. The object appeared to above Mt. Burdell. No commercial jets or other aircraft were in the area at the time.  Totally suprised by what I was seeing I quickly thought about fireworks or flares, both ideas which I discarded quickly. I called for my son to come here as I continued to watch this amazing & mysterious celestial display. Then just as my son was about to step outside, there was a quiet, low frequency popping noise, & the object seemed to dissapear, or rather transform. In it's place was a dot of light, appearing much like a small distant star, except it was moving, still in a westerly direction.

I say this to say we were familiar with machinery that have different color lights. This object hoovered above us wraped with different color lights.It was spining as it moved through the sky.  We all saw it and we were to young to say UFO.  My latest encounter was summer of 2004. I was with friends at a lecture that deals with phenomanom, theorys ,reptilians Ufos and conspriacies. I hung around after the lecture was over.The lecturer usually has tons of questions and answers for people buying his products for health etc etc etc, after the lecture is done. So it was an unusual wait for me but its fun to hang around and talk about the info that was brought to us by the DOC i call him for now.  The doc and all the left over guest was daparting the house and we were standing in his driveway. Some type of mental energy directed us to look up to the sky just above us. We all looked up and this object that was miles and miles above us was standing still and when it had all our attention it speed off through the air like a nasa rocket with ferrocious speed. It was still and then it speed off to let us know that it was there to protect the DOC or to confirm that we were in sync with the truth. I was stunned myself becouse I witnessed it. We all confirmed that it was a UFO that evening. I believe it blinked a lite for us as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

From a distance, I saw a large red glowing light near my apartment. As I got closer, I thought it was actually a new sign over the local convient store.  When I got under the large glowing light, I realized for the first time it was not supported by any pole.  I could not figure out how store could do that. The light made no sound and did not move.  I moved away from the store to look for some form of support.  It was not more than 10-20 feet above the store.   I was the only one out at that time.  As I was watching the light, it finally dawned on me that it was not supported and in fact it was flying on its own.  A guy in a truck came around the corner and pulled over to see it as well.  I asked him to observe independently and not speak to me.  We would exchange phone numbers and write our own description of what we saw.  We would get in touch with each other the next day and go to the authorities.  He agreed.  As we both stood there, the light without any noise moved laterally from the store directly over both of us. I could not see any structure of any type.  Just a bright red light.  I picked up a rock to see if there was any structure there but I could not reach it by throwing the rock.  It moved laterally back over the store and then back over us.  Then in a flash it was gone through the universe leaving a bright red streak of light at a slight angle up.  It never made a sound of any type.  The guy got in his truck and refused to give me his number.  He said he was way to spooked to ever want to talk about this again.  When I got to my apartment, I told my roommate about what I had seen.  He said that that there had been sightings all night and people calling in on the radio talk shows.  The next day in the Denton papers, the FAA said that they were using weather balloons and they were all accounted for and nothing else was in the sky that night. The story died right there.  I know there is no balloon that can hover without moving, put out a blinding red light like that, move laterally and then shoot through the sky at the speed of light.  I have never reported this to any publication of any kind since the guy took off.

I have since purchased 19 Tremaine A map of Kenmore NY. would be helpful here.  When I was a boy my, friend and I saw a UFO on Tremaine Ave. in Kenmore NY.  I have always told persons about my experience and one day surfing the web I decided to see if anyone else had seen any UFO’s in my home town.  I came across a report dated June 1, 1975.  When I read the report I now believe with a high degree of certainty that the craft that was seen by the man on Keller and his mother was the same craft that my friend and I saw.  Here is my reasoning. 1.	Although I do not remember the exact date, I knew it was summer because I remember wearing shorts (big deal for Buffalo! :)). He listed June 1, 1975. 2.	Keller is only a few blocks away from Tremaine, in his report, he said he observed the object from a second story window on Keller in the direction of Kenmore Ave. 3.	He says approximately 200 feet high, again the object I observed was low indeed. 4.	8:30 PM also sounds correct because I had to be home by 9:00 PM in those days. 5.	Kenmore Ave. is two blocks away from Tremaine and is consistent with the direction of the Keller observer.  If you were on Keller, One would be looking toward that general area. 6.	Also the color, blue, and shape of the object basically round are consistent with the object I saw. Here is my account of what I believe were one in the same craft on that night. My friend and I were walking to my house which was the house next door to his.  I was looking down and he was obviously looking up when he said, “Hey, ‘name’, what is THAT!” with strong emphasis on the “that”.  We were directly in the middle of the first block on Tremaine Ave nearest Delaware Ave, two blocks from Kenmore Ave.  The object was incredibly bright, yet it did not seem to give off any light in the conventional sense you would expect an object as bright as this to illuminate houses or something.  Trying to describe the color as blue is generally correct however the objects coloration was a series of other colors that flashed with white and reds and many hues in-between, although, mostly a deep blue.  The object was directly over a neighbors house about 30 feet.  I remember thinking that a kid with a good “arm” could have hit it with a baseball.  The object began as a more solid blue color and then intensified in colors of pulsating blues and other hue’s(flashing, query Lake Erie ufo's on UTube).  It moved in the direction of Kenmore Ave very slowly.  I would say the size of the object may have been about the size of a bus, however judging size was problematic since it was so bright only its general circular/oval shape was discernable. It was like looking at a bright blue flashing strobe through a toilet paper tube, essentially it looked like a pulsating blue hole in the sky on a blue grey background.  The object then moved slowly toward Delaware and Kenmore Ave intersection.  After it moved out of site, my friend and I rushed in my house and told my parents.  We then made some drawings of it.  I do not have the drawings anymore.  BTW, if you check out the Lake Erie UFO’s on UTube that would be essentially what I saw, but I saw it at point blank range.   Those objects pulse in exactly the same manner as the one that I saw.  As a side note, has anyone thought to do any simple patter matching algorithms on those pulsating objects?  Experts always analyze their colors but never the patterns it seems.  There are many character sets, or alphanumeric encodings that may show that the objects possess intelligence or are trying to communicate.  Such as maybe listing primes or the Fibonacci series?",2008-06-12T00:00:00,,

I was 16 years old at the time and was walking along the edge of a soybean field with my trusty .22 rifle squirrel hunting.  I heard a very loud high pitched buzzing sound (like a cicada in the trees--which it may have been) but then everything was silent--even the birds. I looked up over my shoulder and saw a silver sphere just hovering about 300 feet above the ground and 1/4 mile away. It just stayed there. I thought, ""hey look, a weather balloon."" but there wasn't anything hanging from the bottom. Not a weather balloon. No gondola, so it also wasn't a hot air balloon either. It was just there hovering silently.  Here's where I acted like a typical teenager. The .22 had a scope on it, so I looked at the sphere through the scope--looked like a shiny silver ball. I decided, ""what the heck"" I squeezed off a shot thinking if it was a balloon, I would be able to retrieve it. It hovered for a few seconds more then slowly drifted up and out of sight. There were cumulus clouds in the sky that day and the sphere was going along the edge of them rising in a slightly erratic fashion. But I was able to keep it in sight while it rose due to the contrast of the white clouds.  The thing that still makes me wonder to this day is how readily I accepted what I saw and how I felt no alarm ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Many of the details of the night have been forgotten, but I haven’t forgotten that it happened.  I do remember being on duty and receiving a call from Security and was told that there was a bright white light hovering over the primary entrance to the base.   Many of the typical calls that we received could be handled with the use of a binder full of checklist.  That way the Wing Staff wouldn’t have to be disturbed in the evening and could be briefed in the morning.  It didn’t take too long to realize that we didn’t have a checklist that applied to the information being given to us during this call.  We were told that the bright white light was stationary and there was no engine noise.  I promptly notified the Wing Commander and he appeared at the Command Post in a very short amount of time.  These sightings went on for many of the following nights that I worked.  Many of the following nights the Command Post would have the usual two Controllers plus several of the Wing Staff members.  One night as I was getting off my work shift we received a call that another sighting had been made.  We were not able to see these sighting ourselves because there were no windows in the Command Post.  The Wing Commander asked me to take his Staff Car and take the Helicopter Pilot to his aircraft.  That was the first sighting that I actually made of this bright white light.   It appeared to be hovering over the runway from where I was standing but this also could have put it over the weapons storage area.  I dropped off the Helicopter Pilot and watched him takeoff towards the object that we had been watching.   I saw it leave very rapidly as he approached it.  It left so rapidly that it almost would appear that it had simply turned its light off.  That is not what happened because I could detect a very rapid motion from a standstill.  This accelerat! ion was faster than any that I had ever seen before or since.  I know there was much effort during the days that followed to try and gather information about possible landing sites in the area.  Airports were checked for transient aircraft landings and fuel purchases.   Fields and wide riverbeds were also considered.  No information was ever collected that I am aware of that would verify that this was just some kind of aircraft/balloon/helicopter/hoax as we know it.  Needless to say, I only had and needed access to information that pertained to the performance of my job as a Command Post Controller.  I can say that as far as I know, this sighting remained Unidentified, it was Flying and it was an Object.  So, I can refer to this as a UFO but I can’t make any conclusion of its origin/destination/intentions.   I believe that Approach Control was able to track the object with radar as I recall.   I can’t confirm much of the other information that I have read but I do know what took place where I was working.   It was a very impressive sighting and would be quite hard to believe unless you were there and saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was about 12 or 13 at the time.  I was riding my bicycle up and down the street in our apartment complex, which was approx. 1/3 of a mile long.  From the North end of the street a ""classic flying saucer"" came hovering over the tree line about 40 to 60 feet high. It was like right out of the movies, a metallic disc with colored lights rotating around it (I'm colorblind so sorry I can't tell you the colors).  Diameter was about 30 to 40 feet, 10 to 15 feet in height symetrical top and bottom.  It made no noise. At the time I was not scared, but only interested and I followed it from one end of the street to the other.  I literally road my bicycle under it the entire length of the street (1/3 mile) which it strangely hovered directly over seeming to follow the road.  I was easily able to keep pace with it so I estimate its speed at no more than 15 MPH.  At the end of our street I stopped and watched it continue on at the same pace.  Because of its low altitude it disappeared from view before to long. At that time the Goodyear blimp was a regular sight in Lauderdale and TV/movies portrayed UFO exactly like this one; so even at that young age I was skeptical, thinking that this was to good to be true.  I figured I would hear of a hoax or some explanation.  That never happened.  Now as I've grown older I realize the importance and significance of such a ""clear and close"" sighting.

I had laid my head back to rest and noticed a dim red glowing ball in the sky outside my window. I rolled down the window and saw a rectangular shaped craft approximately the size of a football field with dimly glowing red globes on each end. Since the ballfield lights were still on they gave some illumination to the bottom of the craft, which was hovering at approximately 150 ft. I noticed what appeared to be ducting all over the bottom side, and the red glowing globes were veiny. At this point we were at the stop sign and I told my mother to stop, while I had my head completely out of the vehicle. There was no noise from the craft whatsoever. It slowly moved to the South about 50 ft, then changed direction to the North about 50 ft. and then the craft changed from it's horizontal position to a vertical position and started moving. There was still no sound from the craft. I instructed my mother to stop but she told me other cars were coming up behind us and she began travelling North on the highway, and the object mirrored our speed and direction for approximately 4 miles before rapidly accelerating off toward the North. We arrived at our home a minute later, and I stayed outside to see if it may return or if anything more may happen. Aprroximately 20 minutes after I had last seen the craft, I noticed red lights approaching from the West and another set approaching from the East. As they got closer I could easily hear that they were jet aircraft. What did surprise me was that they were flying straight toward each other and at the point they intersected one aircraft turned 90 degrees and headed North, which would have put it on the same flight path as the unidentified craft. It seemed strange to me, and knowing the distance of a local Air Force base I rationalized that it was possible the craft showed up on radar and that they were trying to fly a grid in order to find it. I never saw the craft again, but I remember it now, some 30 years later, as vividly as the moment I saw it.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,37.805,-88.177

One of us noticed a very bright white metallic low in the sky, but above the light poles.  We all just stood and stared at it and tried to make sense of it.  We thought it had to be a weather satellite gathering data.  It was shaped like a cigar and had four small red and green lights, positioned on its ""corners,"" one above and to the left, one above and to the right, one below and to the left, and one below and to the right.  These small lights would take turns darting out for a few seconds and then reposition themselves by the bright white metallic cigar shaped object.  The larger object was metallic, but it looked unlike any metal we had ever seen.  It was so bright.  We watched as all four of the small colored lights repositioned themselves at the same time beside the cigar shaped object, and then what happened next made us decide it could not be something from the earth.  It shot up and away at a 45 degree angle at an unbelievable speed.  It was there one moment, and then it was gone.

Multiple Daytime sighting of silver spheres.,Kinder,LA,1977-05-08T16:00:00,sphere,20 minutes,"Occurred : 5/8/1977 16:00  (Entered as : 05/08/77 16:00) Reported: 6/4/2008 10:17:20 PM 22:17 Posted: 6/12/2008 Location: Kinder, LA Shape: Sphere Duration:20 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63701.html,"Multiple Daytime sighting of silver spheres I was  home on leave from the U.S. Navy between May 6-12, 1977.  While home near Kinder, Louisiana, I went and met a couple of friends that were fishing in an irrigation canal about a mile North of town on Green Oak Road around 4:00 PM in the afternoon.  My friends were in a boat fishing about 100 yards from the road as I started walking down the canal levy to meet them.  About half way to them, my friends started yelling like crazy for me to look up in the sky.  They were pointing in the sky to the North of the canal, but I was unable to see anything because of trees growing nearby.  I yelled back and ask what it was, and they were yelling that it was a UFO!   At that time, I started running toward them and looking through the trees for an opening.   As I neared my friends, I saw the object in the sky that had them all excited.  It appeared to be a perfectly round silver sphere glowing against the cloudless blue afternoon sky.  Again I asked my friends what it was, and again they said it was a UFO as they paddled to the bank and told me to get in the boat to have a better look at the object.  As we paddled away from the bank and sat in the middle of the canal watching the object for a few minutes, it appeared to be getting somewhat closer like maybe it was drifting toward us slightly.  I thought that possibly it could have been a weather balloon at that point, except for the fact that it was perfectly round and not long like a weather balloon and the silver glow of the object seemed far more intense that any weather balloon that I have ever seen reflecting the sun.  The object became very stationary again and appeared to be the size of a quarter held at arms length. Without any reference to the size of the object, I was unable to determine if it was the size of a basketball and was just above the grown pine trees, or if it was a mile across and two miles away.  At its closest most stationary point, I remember remarking to my friends that there was something larger and transparent behind the glowing sphere in the sky.  It was difficult to see, but there appeared to be a much larger transparent possibly saucer shaped object on top of the sphere.  You could see the sky through the larger object, but you also see the outline of the larger shape above it as if you were looking through a clear glass object.  About five minutes into the sighting, a smaller very intense red ball of light appeared at the bottom on the silver sphere that looked very much like a lit road flair without any smoke coming off of it. Very slowly the intense red ball of light started to lower from the silver sphere and appeared to be held in position by a very fine dark line in the sky. The much smaller intense red ball lowered a distance about four times the diameter of the larger silver sphere and then stopped in the sky and remained stationary as the dark line that appeared to be lowering the object appeared to turn into ashes and fall from the sky. The lowering of the red object took 1-2 minutes.  Over the period of the next five minutes, the smaller red ball of light started expanding and collapsing in size getting lighter in color as it expanded and redder as it collapsed. Each time the red ball of light expanded and collapsed it remained larger each time and lighter in color until it was finally identical in size and color of the larger silver sphere in which the much smaller ball of light descended from. Now the identical silver spheres of light sat stationary one above the other for another five minutes.  After five minutes, suddenly both spheres moved far across the sky to the West so fast that the eye was unable to see the movement. The objects were simply here and then all of sudden they were sitting far across the sky at a dead stop with a fine dark line in the sky from where each object was sitting connecting to were each object now sat. Again, the fine dark lines in the sky appeared to turn to ashes and fall from the sky in a couple of seconds. Both objects repeated these rapid unseen to the eye movements 4-5 times over the next five minutes leaving the fine dark line each time they moved back and forth widely from the East and West across the sky. Each time both objects stayed perfectly spaced one above the other. After five minutes of unbelievable and unseen movement and instant stops that lasted about a minute each, one sphere darted quickly out of sight behind the trees to the North and the other quickly cleared the Eastern horizon in approximately two seconds. At least this time they were moving slow enough to actually see them move across the sky. During the entire 20 minutes or so that we observed the object(s) moving or sitting stationary in the sky there were no noise whatsoever heard form them. After both objects left the area, we quickly loaded up the boat and headed toward the home of one my friends in the boat that lived two miles North of our location. Upon pulling up at my friends house, his younger brothers and sister came running up to the truck all yelling “daddy saw a UFO, daddy saw a UFO”. My friend said, “let me do the talking” and then asked his dad what he saw. His dad said, “that he had saw a UFO straight above his property for nearly ten minutes and that it sprayed spider webs every time it moved.” When asked what he meant about it spraying spider webs, he said “every time it moved it sprayed spider webs that fell on his property and completely covered his ten acre pasture so that it looked like it was totally covered by white frost”. He said that he tried to gather the spider webs up in his hands and it would melt in his hands as soon as it touched the skin. By the time we had made it to my friends home all of the “spider webs” had melted off of the ten acre pasture. I then headed to town (Kinder, LA) to see if anyone in town had seen the “UFO”. I met nearly a dozen different people shortly thereafter that I knew and they all asked, “did you see the UFO” before I would even have a chance to ask them. With so many people seeing the UFO, I figured that it had to be on the evening news so I headed home to watch it. Nothing was mentioned during the newscast, but at the start of the weather the weatherman announced that 200 people had called the TV station (KPLC) and reported seeing a UFO between Kinder and Oakdale, LA (a distance of 30 miles). However, the weatherman then announced that it was not a UFO. He stated that the National Weather Service had called the station and said that it was only a “special weather balloon that was equipped with rockets”. Two days after the above sighting while riding with my brother on Hwy 165 South of Kinder. My brother ran his brand new Ford LTD II off the road, jumped out of the car and unto the hood yelling, “I saw it, I saw it”.  Thinking he had nutted up, I ask him, “you saw what”. He said that he had just seen one of the silver spheres on the East side of the highway and that it had crashed into the rice field between the 3rd and 4th levy (maybe 100 yards)  from the road. He then attempted to enter the field, but I persuaded him not to enter the field as it was planted with young rice about 6 inches high and flooded with water. I assured him that if the object had crashed, we would have been able to see it from the road. I asked him if he had seen any water or mud come up from the ground when it crashed and he said, “actually it did not look like it crashed, it looked like it went into the ground”. I was just wondering if anyone else had seen a “weather balloon” that could move across the sky in excess of 30,000 mph and stop and go in an instant without making any noise. I have been looking for another one for over 30 years without any luck. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2008-06-12T00:00:00,30.536299999999997,-92.9054

It was in the fall; as best I remember it was 1976 or possibly 1977.  I won't go into the details of how I arrived at that date - I do not actually remember the exact date.  I had gone to my parent's home to pick up my son - he rode the school bus and stayed at their house until I got off from work.  They needed a few items from the grocery store (about a mile and a half from their house) and I volunteered to go get them.  My son was with me.  As we drove down the road, I saw two  ojects in the sky.  They were flying at tree-top level. They made no sound. They were silvery in color.  The looked like two saucers laid rim to rim.  They had red, white and green lights. The white lights were around the middle - windows were also visible around the middle.  I stopped the car - flashed my headlights - and watched them. Nothing happened.  I continued on my way to the store.  I asked the cashier at the store if she saw the UFO's and she looked at me as if I had two heads (or no brain) and has yet to answer,  I decided at that time not to pursue it any further. I could see no movement inside the closest craft; although it seemed as if I could see in the windows.  The next day an article was in the Knoxville News-Sentinel relating a similar sighting in a nearby county by two police officers.  They described the lights as patriotic - red, white and blue.  I did tell my parents of the sighting. My mother scoffed.  My father stated he saw them all the time in the back yard in the evening when he was feeding the animals.  A few years ago, I remembered that after I flashed my headlights (which I had to turn on to do so), and continued down the road that I had to turn on my headlights as it was now getting dark.  I don't know if any time was lost - my parents didn't say anything about being gone a great length of time.  They are both now deceased so it will be impossible to get that input.  My son says he still remembers the UFO's - he was about 8 years old at the time - he will be 39 this August. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I regret that the incident happened so long ago that I am unable to give a precise date. My experience happened in 1977 or 1978, when I was 15 or 16 years old. I was the only witness. At the time, I was a member of my local astronomical society, with responsibility for co-ordinating meteor observation. Astronomy was a serious hobby for me then, and I was used to observing the skies and being able to identify the normal kind of objects in the heavens, e.g. stars, meteors, planets, satellites, and planes. It was late, possibly past midnight – I often did meteor watches through the early hours. I was doing a meteor watch, alone, and lying on a camp bed out on the balcony in front of my house in Slough, Berkshire, UK.  Suddenly there was an astonishing phenomenon in the sky of a kind I had never seen before, and have never seen since. It was definitely not an astronomical phenomenon or any description of human vehicle I know of. The object(s) crossed my field of vision rapidly, within a second or maybe even half a second, so it was moving at incredibly high speed. It consisted of two discs of light. They moved so rapidly that it was difficult to distinguish whether they were clearly defined discs or whether the edges were diffuse, but my memory recalls my perception as being that they were fairly diffuse. Although the discs were about a third or half the diameter of the moon, they were not particularly bright – certainly not as bright as the moon – but not particularly dull, either. The strange thing about them is that they seemed to be connected in some way, as the two discs seemed to be rocking or pivoting about a central axis as they rapidly crossed the skies, so that the discs would during this rocking process be alternately one further in front than the other. The angle of the rocking from the perpendicular was possibly between 30 and 45 degrees, and during the transit, the discs probably repeated this backwards and forwards rocking motion twice. They were separated by a distance of perhaps four or five times the diameter of the moon. The lights were white, and I saw no colour in them. They left no trail, and the trajectory was practically overhead, and they crossed the whole of my field of vision, until it was obscured by the houses on my left-hand side: I was lying on the camp bed facing perpendicularly into the skies. It was a clear, cloudless night. There was no accompanying sound. I did not perceive anything in the object other than these lights, and at the time assumed that these were two separate objects that happened to be flying together in a formation, but was puzzled as to why they seemed to be rocking backwards and forwards about a common axis. However, in more recent years I have wondered whether they! were bo th fixed to the base of a larger, dark craft, whose base was undergoing this rocking motion for some reason: although I was not able to distinguish any craft to which the lights were joined, because of its speed, and the state of utter shock and anxiety I was in when I saw the phenomenon, it could just be the case that I did not notice it.  I shared this information with my parents, and I wrote a report containing much of the detail above, though I cannot remember after all this time what I did with the report: whether I lodged it anywhere - which I think is unlikely, as the Internet wasn’t yet available then, and I wouldn’t have known where to send it – or more likely, whether I filed it somewhere at home and have lost it in the course of the years.  At the time of witnessing this event, I was very much a sceptic with regard to the question of UFOs: I knew enough about relativity to believe that other stars were too far away for extraterrestrial visits to be possible, given the velocity limit of the speed of light. I was simply forced to abandon my scepticism by what I saw with my own eyes. As mentioned above, I was also used to astronomical observations, and could easily have identified a very unusual but natural object, such as a fireball, or a satellite re-entering the atmosphere.  I have scoured the Internet to find out whether anyone has seen anything at all similar to my rocking twin-disc UFO, but have been unsuccessful. I would be extremely interested to know whether you have ever received a report describing anything similar. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I wrote this to my father two days after I saw whatever it was in the sky.  I’m leaning out of my window for all of two minutes when I see three of these really strange oval shape things crossing the sky in front of my window. At first I thought they might be really weird looking planes, but they were traveling at speeds far faster than any plane or anything in the sky I have seen in my life travel at, except perhaps a bird swooping very quickly downward...except these things weren’t traveling downward. They were also the wrong shape for any type of plane and glowed all over like really big, really close, really bright stars. Despite all the evidence against it, I rationalized that they could be fighter planes...until I realized seconds later that there were making no sound, at all. It was at that point that I decided to stop rationalizing what they were and just watch them, since I was obviously looking at something I probably wouldn’t see again. To my amazement, and slightly to my horror, one of the objects on the fair right of the other two moved at a crazy speed to the object on the fair left and went really close to it, almost touching and then moved away, almost like those tiny birds that move together, moving close to each other for a minute before smoothly swerving away; although, nothing like that at all, the movement was way too smooth, too fast, too big, it was more like oh I don’t know two cartoon ovals on a screensaver or something almost touching and then (usually with some weird windows ping sound moving away)they were kind of like blood cells, on the Virgin Airline TVs when people get on and off the plane, except smoother and faster in their movement, but much like the relationship of the blood cells in that movie. Anyway the three objects then proceed to begin (again much to my amazement and horror) to weave inside and outside of each other, making a pattern like weaving a plait. All the while moving amazingly fast and glowing faintly orange. It was as if they were playing with each other, I could not see more however, as the weaving pattern and their movement caused them to move out of my line of sight.  I was in shock. I stood there for quite a while going over what happened in my mind. The whole thing must have been less than a minute long; I stood by my window for much longer. My first instinct (strangely enough, since I’m not usually like this) was to forget it ever happened, to assume that it was simply something normal than appeared abnormal from my location. My conscious mind kicked in at that point and stopped the panicky defense mechanism of repressing and rationalizing from taking hold, and I told myself as I went to bed that night that I had to ask anyone that would listen and understood my Spanish if they saw anything strange last night or if there are any weird birds in this part of the world who reflect the electric light from the cities they fly over (my rationalization that allowed me to get to sleep).  So I go into school the next day, happy that I hadn’t repressed the experience in the night, and asked my friend if she had seen anything odd last night (drawing her a crude picture). She shook her head and had no idea what to say to me, so we both asked the teacher if they were in fact any birds that reflected the electric lights of the cities they flied over.  The teacher glanced at my drawing, listened to my rationale and description and proceeded to tell me that it was probably a UFO and that not only that he’d seen several odd things shooting across the sky growing up here, but also that ¨a lot of people see them, usually in summer. We don’t know if Nasa has some testing field here or something, but they are about. Most, however, are too drunk to really give an apt description at that time of night.¨",2006-10-30T00:00:00,,

I am a 37 year old female. I have seen UFO’s two times in my life.   The first time I saw a UFO I was around 1978 or 1979. I was around age 7 to 10 years old. I honestly don’t remember what year exactly because I have some memory loss.  I was in Piscataway, N.J. at my grandmother’s house.  We were all together. It was my Grandmother, her boyfriend, and my aunt who was just a couple of years older than me when this incident first occurred.  My Grandmother lived on Stelton Road in Piscataway and there were lots of woody fields and a huge farm with lots of acres in her backyard.  As we sat at her dining room table, outside the dining room window, we saw a bright light up in the sky. The light got closer and closer.  It looked like it was landing in the back of her house in the yard.   We jumped up from the table and were all very afraid because the light became so bright that the whole house was illuminated.  I remember us all running into the back bedrooms and the last thing I saw was a shadow of a cowboy hat (that’s what I remember it looking like) at the bedroom window.  The next day when I woke up, I had tiny holes in my t-shirt. I don’t remember us talking about the incident the next day.   My Grandmother and her boyfriend have since passed (in the 90’s) but my aunt and I have spoken about the incident. We don’t know what occurred that night. We just know we saw a very massive unidentified flying object that appeared to land in the backyard that night. My aunt also remembers the tiny holes that were on my t-shirt in the morning we all awoke. We laugh about it because we just can’t explain it but we know it happened.  The second time I saw a saucer-like object in the sky while I was driving down the highway by myself. It was like a shiny glare in the sky and it moved smoothly and super fast. Then it disappeared.  A third time, I was with my cousin. I was driving down Easton Avenue in Somerset, NJ and she was a passenger. We both looked up and saw the same saucer-like object way up in the sky. I said, “Look, it looks like it’s following us!” My cousin and I were hung-over from partying the night before but we knew we were not seeing things. I told here no one will believe us but I told her that I’ve seen this flying shiny thing before and I knew we were seeing a UFO. She thought the same thing.  My son was visited by some type of alien/entity back in 2001. He said the little boy-like “thing” was walking around his play pen. My son said his eyes looked red and he frightened my son. When my son got out of his bed and ran into my room to me. I quickly woke up and shouted, “Leave him alone!”  I actually saw the little boy-like “thing” behind my son. As I sat up in the bed, the “thing” ran through my son and me and it just disappeared. It was so weird yet it happened. My son still talks about that incident from time to time. We know there our “others” with us. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2008-06-12T00:00:00,40.550250322580645,-74.46203032258065

Being a curious person I set my clock to wake up so I could witness this celestial event. I went outside that morning and within a few minutes I did see some heavenly body streak across the sky. Just before I was about to go back inside to bed, I saw something else that I've never seen the likes of before or since. In the not too distant night sky I saw a disc shaped object floating slowly towards me. It was very brightly colored (the lights alternated red, blue, green and orange in a circular pattern around the object). I was transfixed by this sight as it inched towards our house. Over the next twenty minutes it floated closer and closer to the yard where I was standing. After about ten minutes of observation it was clear to me that this object was approaching and would soon be directly over head. I would estimate the disc at about 400-500ft in diameter and flying about 500-750ft in the air. There were times when it appeared to come to a dead stop and simply hover, then begin floating slowly closer. The flickering alternating colorful lights were the most striking thing about it and I remember wondering what government technology could produce such an object. At about the 20 minute mark in the sighting, the object was nearly directly over my head and I remember a strong fear coming over me. I was afraid of being spotted by this craft and went back inside the house. From various windows inside I continued to watch the object as it flew over the front of the house and I ended up in my bedroom watching it pass over the back yard. The object never made a sound. There were a bunch of trees behind the house a few hundred yards away; once the object glided over those trees it appeared to descend further. I watched it hover just above those trees for another 10 minutes or so before it ascended and quickly! flew ou t of sight. No airplane, weather balloon, or helicopter that I know of could account for that sighting. I will never forget what I saw that night and I have come to believe that others have seen the same thing as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I witnessed this event on the evening of July 4, 1978.  This was on the rooftop of a friend, very near Reseda Park in the SFV.  I told my friend, ""We’re going to see a UFO tonight.""  After the fireworks died down, and overhead aircraft thinned out, I turned around facing north and saw what looked like a red ruby in the sky, although its steady brilliance was like that of a red wine with light shining behind and through it.  I said to my friend, ""There it is, there’s the UFO I told you we would see."" He said it was an airliner, but when he realized it wasn’t moving, he guessed it might be a blimp.  We were probably looking up at it 30 degrees.  It began moving toward the east, gradually, slowly, and then stopped.  It did this several times over a period of about ten minutes.  By the time it was in the SE sky, and suddenly became a pinpoint of light, my friend could not see it anymore, because he had taken his eyes off of it.  I was fixed on it.  I thought it might be rapidly ascending upward.  But after a few minutes, it suddenly manifested its original diameter and circumference.  It appeared as the original ruby red when we first saw it, changed to a brilliant orange, then to yellow, and lastly to a pure pearl white before disappearing.  About ten minutes later, it reappeared in a NE direction, and both my friend and I watched it suddenly shift from a round orb or oval to a red semi-circular arc, followed instantly by a neon-blue flash, before disappearing.  The event was reported in a local newspaper, and I was quoted in two paragraphs.  An airline pilot, I learned from the writer of the news article, who was not quoted in the paper, told the reporter that he had observed the UFO and estimated it was 250 feet in diameter.  My next door neighbor, and his friend from down the street, were standing in my front yard looking straight up at what he said was a very large brilliant orange ‘ball’ of light.  The reporter told me that some officials were saying college students from a local city ! college were releasing gas filled balloons, timed to go off.  But the steadiness of the colors, and the size of the object, as witnessed by my next-door neighbor, a professional pilot, and myself compel me to believe that this was not some prank, but a real UFO sighting.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,34.20054642857143,-118.5400982142857

We got in our truck and drove out to the two-lane highway. On the highway we saw a light again off to the left.  We pulled over to watch the light, which was now an orange color.  The area where the light was located is a large area of vacant land with an old barn. My boyfriend got out of the truck and I stayed inside looking out the window. We watched and it looked like it was at the level of a streetlight though we know there were no streetlights there.  It must have been a few minutes while it hovered and then all of a sudden it shot straight up in the air moving incredibly fast.  We watched it go up and then the glowing light expanded and then it was gone.  When we got to the place we were headed, I called somebody related to air traffic/air force to ask them if there was anything they were flying.  They said no, but that it might have been a weather balloon.  It seemed like that might account for the floating glowing light we saw along the tree line but didn’t seem plausible for the way it stayed still and then shot up in the air.  I had never seen something move so fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2008-06-12T00:00:00,29.646086792452827,-82.38107610062893

I was laying in a field looking at the stars when I noticed what at first seemed a very bright V-shaped grouping of stars. The lights were bright, well defined and clear like LED lights, with the point of the V being the brightest. I realized that this cluster of lights was moving very slowly. I don't recall seeing a definitive shape other than the lights, so that is why I say it could have been between 1 and 7 objects. But the lights did move exactly together, so they seemed attached to a body. Like a flashlight in the distance, I noticed one of the side lights seemed to be searching, by its growing duller and brighter. But, as I was laying on my back looking up to the sky, I didn't notice the ground being illuminated and there was no definite beam in the sky. Then it grew extremely bright, and it seemed now pointed directly at me, though I am not sure this is the case. Then the light started flashing at me or in general, in steady strobe pulses. But I can't say that I, or the ground around me were illuminated. Time is somewhat illusive to me during this, but I don't think I watched the light flash at me any longer than a minute before I got up, frightened at this point, and left. I have no idea how long the lights stayed, I didn't go back to look. They were definitely moving very slowly and I think there were seven lights total.

I immediatley jumped out of my seat and pointed towards the sky.  It sort of just hovered there right next to the cloud.  Now this shape is unlike anything i had ever seen.  It almost looked like three different circles combined into a solid shape.  I guess the best description would be the krylon spray paint can.  Imagine those three circles meshed into one.  My 5 friends sat there in aww of the event that was occuring.  My friends also being the biggest skeptics on this planet were also pointing and trying to figure it out.  We sat there and watched it hover for about 15 minutes, keep in mind this was broad daylight about 6:00 p.m.  After about 15 minutes the object began to slowly hide behind a cloud.  But it floated around the cloud and we never saw it again.  Now this is were it gets very strange.  About 10-15 minutes after the object went into the cloud, a all black helicopter appeared and went into the same cloud, almost as if it was chasing it.  The helicopter dissapeared into the cloud.

Was it a daylite satelitte and a large quinsidence?  Or was it a spy plane or device used for watching us or the president?

My husband would often drive home from Virginia to his home in Louisville, Kentucky during long weekends, on a long stretch of highway (I'm not sure what the name of the highway was).   He had said that one time when he was driving home, he had looked out of his rear view mirror and he said that he saw four lights hovering above the trees that were along side of the road about thirty yards from his car.  He said that the lights were two red and two green.  He stopped the car and got out.  There were no other cars on the road at the time and it was around 5:00 p.m.  My husband said that he looked at the trees and saw no lights.  He looked in the rear view mirror again and saw the lights.  He looked in the mirror on the driver's side of the car and he saw the lights.  He looked at the tree and saw no lights.  He said that it was as if the lights were cloaked.  He said that he stood there for the longest time, about 15 minutes and then he went on.  My husband said that it was the strangest thing he'd seen.

We just stood staring at it for at least 20 minutes, I think we said a few things about what it could not have been and decided it must be a UFO, after about 20 minutes I told her to go and get her mom and I would watch the object.  It remained in the same place making no noise as it had been the entire time, when I heard the back door realizing they coming out I yelled it was there while turning towards thier direction and as I turned back towards the object it was gone.  No noise and no evidence it had even been there.  My sister in law and I tried to explain to my mother in law what we had seen and she tried to explain it away.  My sister in law and I discussed it in private many times after that and knew it could not have been a plane for many reasons, the lights were all wrong in color and a plane could not have held the same position for that period of time, not to mention the closeness to the tree, a helicoptor would defeinately have way to much noise and not have the lights.  These lights were bright red, yellow, and green.  The brighness of the lights are what held our amazement for so long.

One night when I was about 10 years old I went out my back door. I was getting ready to go to a cub scout meeting. As soon as I stepped out my back door, I noticed a bright sphere-shaped object hovering (not even really hovering, it was just perfectly still) maybe 500 feet or less over the corn field near my house. The sphere was about 1500 - 2000 feet in total away from me (in a straight line.) I was totally shocked. I had never seen anything like it. Even at 10 years old I knew it was not an airplane or a helicopter. It made no noise whatsoever. I was overcome with the feeling that the object was ""staring"" straight at me. I can't explain this, it's just something I knew was happening. I also had the sense that I couldn't look away. It was a very, very peaceful feeling, I felt very happy, more so than the moments before I stepped out the door. It was as though the object was telling me ""it's ok, don't worry"". Very strange but that is the overwhelming feeling I had.  The sphere wasn't very big. Maybe about 50 - 75 feet across. It was emitting light, but the light didn't really light up the night. There were no beams of light coming off it, but still it was as though it was shining a flashlight straight at my eyes. The light was white, all white. This lasted maybe 20 seconds and as I said was a very joyful feeling.  Then suddenly, the light shot off across the sky at an extremely high rate of speed. It didn't have to speed up. It reached the full speed I saw it traveling at instantly. It travelled east toward Grand Island and in the distance it arched upward slightly and disappeared.  I'll never forget this as long as I live. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2008-06-12T00:00:00,40.93567848101266,-98.3301

This object passed directly overhead, diagonally, back to front, horizon to horizon.  It was at low altitude, maybe 3,000 feet.  It was cylindrical, traveling horizontally.  It was absolutely silent, looking as if suspended from above.  The sides were covered uniformly with pipes, conduits and other mechanical devices, similar to the spaceships in Star Wars.  The ends however, were flat, circular, and appeared polished.  The whole thing was some type of dark metal. The object was narrower in the center and wider at the ends, like an hourglass, but less so.  The sun was low in the sky, to the left of the object, so the direction of travel would have been northwest. There were two small airplanes of the civil aviation type in the sky at the time. These were not fat away, maybe a mile or two directly in front of us.  I could hear the sound of their engines clearly.  The object passed between us and the airplanes, diagonally. That made it easier to estimate the size, altitude, etc. and to be certain it was silent, or very quiet.  The size was similar to a large airliner.  People in the airplanes would certainly have seen it. I doubt I was misidentifying some conventional object.  I have no seen anything like it, before or sense.

We had built a bonfire and were drinking some beers. We had several cars and trucks parked around. It was about 11:00 pm when “Jack” said, do you feel that? It must be a train coming down the tracks. Then “Paul” said, train my ass look at that! He was pointing to the sky. In the sky was a huge rectangular object about the size of two football fields with a bank of what looked to be lighted windows. It was just hovering over the valley everyone was just in amazement. Then it just flew very fast to the east…like warp speed on star trek.  Our friend from the air force “Travis” started rattling off all kinds of plane names and numbers. Another friend “Joey” who’s dad was a corporate jet pilot. Started telling stories about things his dad had seen over the years flying…then Joey suggested that it came from the deep old mining pits that were all around the area. How could it just appear? He said.  I asked Travis what it was. He said maybe something experimental from the old Fort Crowder base. Then he said, “I have never seen anything in the sky that big, let alone hover with out moving”. We all just kept speculating.  It did not make sound however; we all felt the earth vibrate. It was a bright moon so we all saw the silhouette. Very rectangular “straight edged” and very big. The total number of people who witnessed the UFO was seven however; the three girls from Granby said they did not see anything.

The entire time this was happening it was heading in exactly my direction from 0.2 miles away, and lit up when it was perfectly clear for me to see!  By the time I ran from the window thinking I personally was being pursued, the object was about 100 yards away and closing. I'm not positive, could have been from initial shock, but I think I remember beeing shined on with a directional light.  I've been paranoid at night after this event occured.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,42.7705,-83.7467

It was around 10:30pm when my mother, brother and I had just gotten home from an event. We lived on a horse shoe street which was somewhat surrounded by tall trees (50 feet plus). We had just pulled in the drive way and as we were getting out of the car my mother says ""What is that?"" and as plain as day hovering about these tall trees was a U.F.O. My brother says that’s a flying saucer. There is no doubt to what we are seeing. This is visible no more than 200 feet away. This saucer length had to be at least 6-8 maybe more diesels long all lined up together. I was amazed at what I was seeing. I just could not believe my own eyes. This saucer hovered over these trees for 5-10min. It had several white lights around the outer part. After 5-10min it began to rise slowly and I mean slowly and with in a few seconds it took off at an angle leaving just a tracer of its path and it was gone. I can close my eyes today and see it all over. I will NEVER forget. I look to the sky all the time hoping to see one again.  Also, I myself have experience what I believe was an alien encounter. I believe this occurred after the sighting not sure of the date/time but there was light outside. I was sitting in my bed reading a book and my back is to the bed room entrance. So, I’m reading and I feel 3 taps on my left shoulder and mentally I’m assuming it’s my brother and as I turn and look over my shoulder I see a white figure with an oval shaped head and black oval eyes and I freaked out . I jumped up and ran out of my house. I’ve seen this figure described on television by other people whom have claimed of seeing aliens but some people say its grey or some color but what I saw was white. It freaks me out to even think about it. I believe there are chosen people to see the things we see and I feel bad for the people that will never truly believe and know that we are not alone.

I want to make this report just to do my part so we can someday find out the truth. My incident happened on Thanksgiving in 88 or 89.  I’m not really sure of the actual year, however, I am 100% certain of the day and of what I experienced.  I would like to add that at that time I was assigned to a Special Ops unit in the USAF out of Frankfurt Germany and I was just visiting my in-laws for the Thanksgiving Holiday. My father in law and I went fishing up in the mountains of Alamogordo, NM on Thanksgiving.  We fished Silver lake all day and were suppose to come home early for dinner, but decided to stay late since the trout were biting pretty good that day.  By time we were on our way back home to Alamogordo, it was dark, however, it was a very clear night with no clouds or overcast.  We’re driving up and down hills coming from the mountains.  Alamorgodo, NM is home to Holliman AFB and next to the White sands missile range.  Also, this little city is based at the bottom of the mountain range and it is pretty flat down in the basin where the city sits. Anyway, as we are going up and down hills, we finally get the part of the trip, where you can actually see the entire basin, the city and a little past the city, there are two large Mountains or very large Hills (they are the only two large landmarks on the other side), which are located behind the city from where we were coming from.  As we are driving I started looking at the two mountains ahead of us and I noticed some lights by them. As I started watching them fascinated by the brightness of them, I noticed that there were three lights and they were moving in odd ways.  One would go up vertically, then speed off at a 45 degree angle behind the mountain, then it would speed back in front of the mountain.  Then soon, 2 more lights joined them.  I would describe them as bright white spheres.  Anyway, these 5 spheres or lights, were just doing the most unimaginable maneuvers in front of these two mountains.  I watched them for about 3 minutes to make sure I was not seeing things and finally told my father in law about them.  He started watching them as well and after a couple of minutes, he stated what the hell is that? We watched them for over 15 minutes and the entire time they were flying, hovering, speeding from point to point and even at times disappearing and reappearing on the other side of the mountains. I must state that I worked on the flight-line a lot, during the day and night and am very familiar with aircraft lights, at night, during the day and have a lot of experience working at night on the flight line. I can tell an aircraft or a helicopter with no problem.  I must also state that during my assignment in special ops, our unit worked closely with Navy Seabees, 82nd Airborne, USAF special forces (Combat Control Teams) and even had the opportunity to support Delta force.  Our unit covered all of Africa, Europe and the Middle East, so any missions, wars, conflicts or humanitarian efforts in those theaters, we covered and supported via the flight-line, during day, night, snow, sun etc.. Getting back to my incident.  I guess it’s hard for me to describe exactly what the 5 spheres were doing except by saying they were kinda of doing a star shaped pattern next to the mountains.  Also, I could not make out the details of the mountains, but I could see two huge dark silhouettes of the mountains.  These spheres were disappearing behind it then reappearing when they got to the other side.  It would take them maybe 1 or 2 seconds to go from the 1 o’clock of the mountains to the 7 o’clock position, then streak across the mountains again to the 3 o’clock position. Etc. If you draw a star with your pencil, that is exactly what they were doing. I tried to draw a diagram below, with the mountains being the black and the patterns of these ORBS in red.  Please understand, that these crafts or lights, were disappearing behind the mountains and sometimes flying in front of the mountains, so I could see very well that they were in close proximity of those hills, where they could fly behind them and in front of them. These things were extremely fast and their maneuvers were unbelievable.  I have flown on a lot of military planes and  helicopters, I have been to many air shows, and as stated earlier have worked on the flight-line extensively.  So I have seen most USAF aircraft, F15, F16, A10, F18, B1 bomber, B2 bomber, etc T38, KC 135, C130, C5, C141, etc, etc,  I am very familiar with those aircrafts and what they look like and what they can do. In conclusion, either I witnessed a new secret aircraft being tested that we have no knowledge about or I saw a UFO (I’m not saying flying saucer), just unidentified.  This incident has stayed with me for a long time and to this day, I cannot imagine any aircraft doing those maneuvers. These things were super super fast, agile and could stop on a dime.  As stated they would fly in front and the back of the two mountains so I could see them moving, speeding, disappearing, reappearing and hovering. I guess we could have been maybe 5-10 miles away.  I could clearly see the silhouttes of the mountains and could see these things fly in front and in back of the mountains.  We were close to whitesands testing facilities, so either new technology or the dreaded word UFO.  I also am very aware of the SR71 and the fact that it was activated n 1964 or 68 and as an active duty member, we really didn’t start seeing pictures of it till about 84 so they kept that out of the public eye for a long time.  These things were not conventional aircrafts.  I currently work for the DOD as a logistician. Thank you for your time.

Daytona summer 1989 Many details are fuzzy, I had to guess on time and date. It's been a long time but has been on my mind often since it occurred. During the summer of 1989 me and two of my friends were house sitting about a block away from Daytona Beach shore. The house was on a bit of a hill so more than just our street was visible. Late in the evening around midnight, all the lights went out. We rushed outside to see what was going on and noticed that all the lights in the neighborhood were out. I do not remember if there was a sound.  I remember this sighting coming from the non-water side of the city. This much I know for sure: In the horizon a giant blue-ish light shot from lower ground to miles in the sky. It then fanned out,  covering the entire sky in an incredible blue green display that lasted many seconds. It looked like a laser light show but the size and complexity was way too enormous to have been man made. Think of the movie Tron and a peacock tail. Both of my friends witnessed this. What we all agreed on instantly was it's size and that the power outage had to be related.  Moments after, the lights in the neighborhood began to come back on. We were absolutely blown away and speechless at what we saw. We called 911 to see if anyone had reported lights but I only remember getting no feedback from the operator. If you were outside that night in Daytona or any surrounding city you would have seen this. This is the first time I have reported it because it is so difficult to describe and at the time there was no internet or easily accessed reporting agency. I would really like to know if more people witnessed this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Snow was falling and school had been cancelled the next day already. A snowball fight broke out in the front of our house with my brother and his friend. The back of the house backs up to miles and miles of forest. I decided that there may be more snow back there to make a snowball. I went in to the back yard to (which is about 70 yds and slopes downward into the woods) and noticed the trees in the woods background were lighting up in a flashing manner. I thought there may be hunters back there but the flashing light was way too powerful for any spotlight that local raccoon hunters would use. I thought it may be lightning but only a section of the woods was lighting up. The light was like a fluorescent white color and reminded me of a strobe light color. The woods would light up for about 10 seconds and the light (or beam) seemed to be scanning the section of the woods like it was examining the trees and then would turn off for 5 secs. Then this would repeat. It was tough to see what direction that light was coming from so I just continued to walk towards the woods. Finally I saw the object just below the tree line which consisted of mostly tall pines. The tops of the trees were rustling eerily, and there was a misty object that was disk shaped and bright that slowly moved away and zoomed off fast. No sounds whatsoever.

What I saw still stays in my mind though it's been more than ten years ago. A bright light was stationary high up in the sky strobing pale yellowish light, then red, then green then back to yellowish and so on.We watched it for more than half an hour.Another white light came from the east and moved horizontally toward the brighter one.It disappeared as though flying into the brighter one, then a second zoomed toward the larger light and disappeared into it in the same manner. The the brighter object then dimmed it's light and headed straight up very quickly.It stopped briefly straight over where it had been then zoomed off at high speed in am easterly direction. We know how long the sighting lasted because Jay Leno was just coming on (11:30). We were still watching the activity when Conan O'Brien came on one hour later. We reported the sighting to Mufon here in Vancouver and spoke about it at one of their meetings. I also wanted to see whether anyone else had seen this and put an in the Kelowna paper. I received two responses and a phone call from others who had similar experiences though not of this one.One woman married to a forest ranger saw three large triangular craft flying at night. Another man had seen what he called paisley objects on the lake. The radio station there told me that others had seen this kind of thing quite often. I've since heard of an abduction in the Kelowna area involving a former school mate. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The characteristics that were most interesting is it was round (looked like an aspirin pill), shined like chrome and moved at incredible speed.  I've seen jets move before and this was no jet, it would be going like Mach 7.  When it was close by, if you calculate by distance at 2000 ft from us, it must have been like 200 ft in diameter. As we watched it from a distance and the shine was still very intense (seemed just like the sun reflecting from the surface of this craft) it just moved again and we just lost it, it was way too fast to follow with our eyes.

My uncle lived in a trailer park just off the side of a Marine Fighter base. We would walk down a dirt road to the end of the AOA area to watch the planes. We especially enjoyed watching them do touch and goes after dark. This was because the f-16's had bright green lights on their tail fins. On the last night we were in Yuma, we stood on a dirt hill at the end of the base's runway. It was around 9pm when the last of the fighters took off. This time when they disappeared over the horizon, they never returned. After about 30 minutes of no aircraft activity on the base, we got bored and left. On the way back to the trailer park I just happened to look up to admire the stars. When I looked up, I could only see darkness. At first I wondered if some clouds had rolled in without us noticing them. So I began to look out past the dark spot to see how far the cloud cover reached. It was at that moment that I noticed there were star visible all around the dark spot in the sky. Confused I began to study the dark spot. It was then that I noticed that the object had a long straight leading edge. I could tell, because the stars above were disappearing under these leading edges at an equal rate of speed. Then out of the corner of my eye I noticed a flash. I looked toward the tiny flash and it went off again. It reminded me of an airplane beacon. Next I followed the leading edge of the wing forward until I noticed a tiny white light at the nose. The light was constantly on, just very hard to detect with the naked eye. It looked like all the other stars in the sky. I then followed the leading edge of the wing down the opposite side of the craft. At a great distance away, I spotted another tiny green strobe light. The object appeared to be about 200-400 feet up.  Standing back I looked from one strobe light to the other. Then I followed those lights up to the tiny light in the nose area of the craft. The vehicle was huge. I estimated about a football field’s length from wing tip to wing tip. Perhaps half a football fields length from the back of the craft to the tiny nose light. I couldn't believe how large the craft was!  The craft moved at a very low rate of speed. It almost seemed to have a hover capability. I stopped walking to listen to see if the object made any noise. I heard a very quite blowing sound. It reminded me of a fighter plan idling on the taxi-way. The exception was that it was barely audible. We watch the craft float slowly over the edge of Yuma and then disappear into the darkness. The whole event took about 3 minutes time. I always assumed that this was a military aircraft. I could clearly see the Marine Fighter Base's air traffic control tower from where I was at the time. I figured if I could see the tower, then the tower could see the object. Since there was no activity on the base at the time, I figured they knew about it. A military fighter base wouldn't let such a large object float past the end of their runway and do nothing. Then last year I was listening to the Art Bell show on Coast to Coast Am. On that show a guest called in from Arizona. The guest exactly described the same craft that I had seen. This brought up the whole discussion of the famous ""Arizona Lights."" After hearing several stories about this large triangle type craft I decided to contact you. Is this a military craft being secretly tested at night? What is your take on this incident?  Ps. I am an air show fan and love all sorts of military aircraft. I've seen a lot of planes in action, but nothing I've ever seen or heard came close to this craft and it capabilities...",2008-06-12T00:00:00,32.7038626459144,-114.59088443579766

I was living in down town Sacramento, California. I don’t remember what time of year it was, but I lived on the corner of 13th street and F street. I always took my dog out for a potty walk, roughly between 10 and 11p.m. Across from our place was a vacant lot, that I always walked him in. I took him out that night as I always did and walked across the street to the vacant lot. It was a cool evening and the fog was hovering above the roof tops, when I noticed above me, in the fog, lights. I looked up and was amazed at what I saw. There were three sets of triangular lights, each triangle was made up of three long strips of light, formed into each triangle. What ever it was, where ever they came from, was huge, I don’t even believe I could accurately describe the size. They were enter moving about each other, they were red and blue. I could only compare what I was looking at, to some type of computer graphic design you might see on the web. I was so amazed that I ran back into the house and asked my then 15 year old son to come out and look too. He did, and we both stood there in the middle of the street amazed, at what we were watching above our heads, the lights moving in and out of each other, and changing about, while what ever was making them, hid in the fog. I didn’t own a video camera at the time, or I would have tried to film the spectacular sight that was occurring. We stood there, my son and I, for a very long time. Two of our neighbors emerged from their apartment, and at first look, they laughed at us, like what the heck are they doing standing in the middle of the street. And then they too, glanced up to the sky above us, and muttered something to the matter of profanity when they too saw the lights. It was at that moment that the lights disappeared. I have never in my life before or since seem anything like it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2008-06-12T00:00:00,38.57580181028241,-121.45009956553221

We watched it as it paralled us for 15 - 20 minutes.  It resembled molten metal and seemed at times to drip fire.  It would dip down below the trees, but then it would reappear within seconds. I first thought it must be someone in a hanglider, and I looked hard for the tell-tale sign of someone underneath the orange object that was shaped somewhat like a sail. I thought the bright orange color must be a reflectiton of the sun, which was getting lower in the sky, but the object wasn't just the color of fire.  It looked like it was fire, only with a shape.  I had thought about stopping the car, but my daughter, not yet 10-years old, was afraid and urged me not to stop.  However, I did drive very slowly and couldn't stop myself from looking at the odd object.  After we crossed the river, the highway veered slightly to the right and went up a hill.  It was at this area that the object stopped paralleling us and appeared directly in front of us over the road.  I had been puzzled and amazed before, but now I was afraid.  I checked behind me and saw no one, so I stopped my car in the middle of the highway  Then something happened I will never forget.  The crescent shaped object turned in on itself and disappeared for a fraction of a second.  When it reappeared, the crescent was facing the opposite side.  It had been facing to the right, now it faced the left.  Then it moved from over the highway back to the left side of the highway.  It was now in front of us to the left.  I moved my foot from the brake, and started the car again.  The shape dipped down below the trees and then went back up.  Then it dipped down again and stayed down.

Trumbull, Ohio, 1994, Local Authorities & NBC cite Mass UFO sighting, Gov./Military Denies Incident, flimsy, but effectiveCover UP Note:  I live approximately 30 mile from this area and I never heard this story until recently when I was seeking quantitative data on Mexico City UFO reports for possible hypothesis tests relating public opinion of UFOs and official sighting reports frequency.  I didn’t find the Mexico City data I sought, but I did find this story and was nearly ill.   The following is an abbreviated account of a mass sighting incident in Trumbull County, Ohio on Dec.14, 1994.   The incident involved the prolonged observation and pursuit of at least one, but more likely multiple UFOs, by no less than 15 local police officers.  The local 911 office received numerous civilian reports of inexplicable craft-like illuminated objects moving through Vienna, OH and surrounding communities.  Many objects were reported to be low near the ground and all were reported as displaying bright multicolored lights.  Police officers pursuing the objects were able to describe specific details about the objects physical appearance including the presence of machinery-like aspects of the objects.  A reporter for local TV station 33 Youngstown (ABC) initially followed up the incoming reports, but when she learned that the incident was most likely a genuine anomalous event and following a telephone call to the local FAA, she admittedly dropped the story out of fear.  This admission was made in an interview with an UFO investigator in 1998. Police officers and local emergency 911 employees are willing to publicly discuss their observations.  Official verified recordings of communications between police officers and telephone communications to and from the 911 center are publicly available as well. NBC did a report on the incident broadcast in 1999 called ""Confirmation."" The story went completely unreported for two years until 1996 when a UFO investigator mistakenly called Vienna, OH Police Department when seeking information on a 1988 sighting near Urbana, OH. When the reporter made an inquiry about a recent UFO sighting the officer fielding the investigator’s call began describing events that took place in 1994.  The investigator quickly realized that this was a different event from that of his initial inquiry and the event being generously described by the officer was unusually significant in terms of standard UFO phenomena reports.  The event described was openly corroborated by several law enforcement officers as well as many other witnesses. The local 911 Center provided the investigator with duplicate recordings of presumably all related communications from the night which are widely available and undisputed as authentic.  All witnesses noted that objects were silent.  Rough Outline of Events the morning of Dec.14, 1994 paraphrased from a publicly accessible non-commercial website dedicated to the aforementioned principal investigator’s numerous reports.  An object was first observed at a treetop level before midnight in the near  Samson Drive and the Fifth Avenue Extension. It was bluish-green with flames. Four calls were placed to the dispatch office before midnight. An additional call was placed to WYTV Channel-33 news reporter 'St*%ey A.  A unit (#998) was dispatched to Samson Drive to investigate.  At this point Unit #998 viewed the object at close range.  It was red and illuminating the ground with a red light ""as bright as daylight."" Approaching the object, the police car suffered inexplicable electrical failure and stalled.  From all accounts, the object was described as 'huge.'  Officer Unit #998 later stated that he encountered an elderly man in the roadway, saying: ""it was right above my house!""  Having reported his (Unit #998’s) observation, other units are dispatched for backup.  A call is placed to the airbase by the dispatcher. There is no answer at the airbase, and a call is then placed to the FAA tower, where the tower operator states to have nothing on his radarscope within a 60-mile radius of Youngstown. At this point, the unidentified aircraft departs from the Samson Road area and Unit #998 advises that he was 'out of service' for a duration to ""gather his thoughts."" The time is near 1:00 a.m.  The UFO is again reported when Unit #429 advises central dispatch that an object is spotted to the east of the 911 center. The dispatcher, eager to view the object, steps away to look for the UFO as another person takes her place. The object is said to be near Route 11, and several units from different locations and directions triangulate its position from areas near Kings Grave and Henheid. The object is then observed over an empty field, and changes color from whitish red to a pulsating greenish lavender. The dispatcher returns, saying that she did not see the UFO. More incoming radio traffic relevant to the UFO causes her to 'take a break' where she plans to meet an officer who will pick her up and take her to see it Through heavy radio traffic, several unspecified police units converge upon the UFO and triangulate its position. This documented triangulation of an aerial object from different vantage points indicates to us that it is not a star, as the object maintains a localized presence within a specific area.  One unit claims that he is heading east to intercept the object. Another unit advises that he is heading north to approach the object. A unit headed eastbound advised that the object was 'southeast' of his location. The object remains stationary over an empty field prior to a departure path to the southeast, where it is seen near an 84-Lumber hardware store. There it is described as a structured object with an attachment or unspecified element protruding from the top of it. Every police department in the county now has the object under observation, and many units are now pursuing the UFO from different departments and localities. Several units are maintaining the object under binocular observation, and discern a 'parachute-like' structure attached to the object. One unit tries to signal the object. One officer, who is at the airbase, is also observing the object from his vantage point. Present with him to view the UFO is a security guard at the airbase. At this point, ""several"" objects are suddenly under scrutiny by law enforcement officials. This is announced rather cryptically, as the officer states: ""We have both of them under observation.  I think you'll know what I mean."" The exact nature of this dialog is uncertain, but it is at this time that multiple objects were observed One specific object, described as a 'white light,' appeared over the airbase, where it was observed and reported by a police officer Pursuit of these objects continued for some time, and it was again stressed that all departments in the county were concerned with the situation, and held the object(s) under visual observation. All objects ascended to a high elevation and appeared as stars in the sky. As the objects were viewed at a high elevation, others on the police force that did not engage in close range observation of the main object, while at its low elevation, assumed that everyone else had misidentified planets or shooting stars.  Toward the end of the event, jets were seen in the area, and one officer believed they were military jets from the airbase sent to engage the objects. One officer refuted the 'planet' comment, but stated that there were shooting stars visible. He stated that there were six shooting stars in the same part of the sky that the UFO was seen in. One unit took exception to the remark that planets were mistaken as UFOs, and he added: ""What I saw was not a planet. It was 50-feet off the ground and lit up the whole area like daylight."" It is thought that the event ended around 6:00 a.m. from previous discussions with officials involved, although a specific time is not reflected on the tape.  The exact number of witnesses to this event is unknown, but the 911 center received numerous citizen reports some of which can be heard on the 911 Center recordings. Unverified reports indicate that officers from 10 Trumbull County police departments responded to the event.  The principal investigator suggests the following departments as likely candidates for having officers involved in close observation and pursuit of the object(s): Niles City PD Howland Twp. PD Girard City PD Warren Twp. PD Liberty Twp. PD Cortland City PD Brookfield Twp. PD Trumbull County Sheriff Hubbard Twp. PD Hubbard City PD  An officer in the area reported climbing an observation tower and saw three hovering lighted masses in a regularly spaced formation.  His communications with other officers is also on the recordings.  Other reports mentioned law enforcement investigation of similar phenomena as far from Vienna as East Palestine, Ohio around the same time.  This assertion needs verification. Other officers noted that in pursuing some of the objects, if the officers fell too far behind the object seemed to wait for then to catch up. Perhaps most unsettling about this event is the clumsy yet mysteriously effective campaign to ignore the event.  The FAA staff, working at the shared Youngstown Regional Airport and Youngstown Air Force Reserve Station at the time of the incident, were all replaced by new staff not long after the event. It may also be of interest to note that the region in which the reported sighting took place is relatively close to a Defense Logistics Agency and National Defense Stockpile at 1740 Niles-Warren River Road, one of the biggest radar/air defense installations in the United States. The Youngstown Municipal Radar Air Defense Agency is also within the locality. Local media deliberately chose to ignore this event despite the fact that local civil authority figures of undisputed credibility and presumed competence openly declared the veracity of the events.  The media doesn’t deny the story, they just refuse to bring it to the public’s attention. During the NBC broadcast of “Confirmation” in 1999, NBC totally ignored the 5 year gap between the event and the report. Included in “Confirmation” was an interview with an astronomer who has a reputation for slanderous statements and a decidedly unscientific anti-UFO stance blatantly accused all witnesses to this event of mistaking stars for large, complex, brilliantly lit airborne objects. The CO at the Air Force Station, also in charge of PR for the Air Force Station, spoke on behalf of the military and blatantly denied, dismissed and derided the whole incident.  The principal investigator made two requests for all data for the Youngstown Airport/Air Force Station regarding air traffic on Dec. 14, 1994.   The request was made in accordance with The Freedom of Information Act.  Both request were flatly denied  If one does minimal fact-checking, this frightening incomprehensible incident will be corroborated and verified via a myriad of sources.  I find it disturbing that the incident is not already included in the database and this fact alone begs many questions.  Anyone truly acting responsibly must bring this national and potentially global security threat into the public eye.  I find it disturbing that North Americans actually disbelieve in UFOs when they are a well-documented officially recognized phenomenon.  A UFO is simply an unclassified airborne object and nothing more can be said about them with impunity, yet many N. Americans are ill-informed and largely misunderstand the phenomenon.  While this event should have been the story of the late twentieth century, it is instead buried in obscurity.   One would think that if NE Ohioans really understood that so many local, credible, civic officials trained to quickly and concisely assess conflicts and threats were witnesses to an event of this magnitude and importance and yet were all deemed incredible, deluded and incapable of distinguishing a star from an aircraft, by the Feds, that the citizens of NE Ohio would be united in indignation and demand an explanation, but for some reason this is not the case.  It is all-too-familiar and frightening.  The motivation and reasoning behind the military’s public stance on UFOs is incomprehensible.  To allow large unidentified objects to invade our air space, potentially drain resources and instill existential terror among innocents is tragic.  Then for the military to wholly deny it, leaving perfect sane productive members of society marginalized, confused or worse.  The mystery of the phenomenon while inexplicable for years, is growing more and more ubiquitous.  Slowly, people are learning and I think the Federal authority’s position ( that I can only hope is erroneously intended for the good of the people), may become a liability as faith in our own institutions decay in the face of incongruent and mounting evidence.  The best way to solve a mystery and counter a threat is to have every hand and mind possible contributing to the effort.  I can say no more except, please, please help inform our fellow citizens.  Ignored and unaddressed issues always resolve themselves one way or another.  I think market and economic stability is threatened by this irresponsible outdated policy of public denial by our Federal Government.  It isn’t a ‘right to know as a taxpayer” issue, but rather one of honesty is the best policy and cooperation between all levels of society in problem-solving is the best chance we’ve got of avoiding global mass-hysteria or some other even worse unprecedented catastrophe when the Powers can no longer hide this anomalous, ubiquitous threat.

I walked to the curb to bring the trash cans back up to the house and noticed a brilliant amber colored light low on the horizon over Mt. Ashland coming directly toward me at an incredible rate of speed.  It looked like a huge fireball in the sky and I was scared that it was a meteor about to hit.  It only took a couple of seconds to reach us and I was shocked when I looked up to see a round metallic object streaking by directly overhead at a low altitude. (It was about the size of a tennis ball held at arms length from my perspective) There was no contrail or fiery tail and it made absolutely no sound at all.  The light source must have come from the top of the craft because there was no light coming from underneath. I watched as it streaked by and disappeared from view within a second or two.

After spotting 1 or 2 unremarkable meteor trails in the southern sky within half an hour, I was about to go back inside when I noticed a formation of 3 faint unblinking starlike objects in a triangle formation in the mid southern sky moving N/NE at about airliner speed. It was positioned ""backwards"" as it were, with the point of the triangle in the rear of the direction it was travelling. It also was a longer distance from the front two objects to the rear, giving the appearance of a long thin triangle.  Size was unknown but my extended thumbnail at arms length would just fit in each point of the group. Other stars could be seen behind the objects as they travelled so it didn't appear to be a single object. When the formation was almost directly overhead I noticed another starlike object, somewhat brighter, that was travelling to the south and which crossed the formation's path, although I don't know if the objects had any relation to each other and I kept my attention on the formation as the other object passed by. No noise was heard nor any other effects from the objects. After watching for approx. 1 minute the objects began to fade and I lost sight of them about midway into the northern sky. It almost seems like they stopped in the sky but due to their faintness that's only speculation. Further scanning of the sky revealed no more objects or meteors and the sky was beginning to brighten towards dawn.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,40.42783368055555,-105.1976295138889

At first it appeared to be one large V shaped object flying with nose of the V pointed to our left. The object consisted of several balls of white lights. We watched the object for several minutes in amazement trying to figure out what it was. The Portland Jetport is to the right of where we were looking. My family has lived in the house we were standing in front of for decades and I have seen thousands of planes fly over our house throughout the years, the sound when they fly over is very loud and shakes the house, people who aren't use to it would cover their ears. I could hear no sound coming from the object. There were several balls of light in the V formation, my approximate would be 7. All of a sudden one of the balls of light came out of it's position in the top of the formation and quickly flew down towards a ball that was in the lowest section, it started to zig zag around it, almost as if it was playing with it. The ball of light in the lower section came out of it's place and they both zipped around, left, right, up and down. The balls of light then went back into their exact position, then at an amazing speed they zipped to the left out of sight.  This was the first and the only sighting I have ever had. I am 100 % sure that it was not a plane, but I have no idea what it was. My best guess is that it was truly from a world other then my own, or something government or military related that the public is unaware of. I feel privileged to have had this experience and am intrigued at the possibilities that our own people or something out there has such technology. It was absolutely amazing.

I was leaving Angel Hospital in Franklin N.C. late one evening around 22:00 hours. We were heading home toward I 85 in Cummings I believe the road was named 365 back then. It was a two lane back road. It was a very dark clear night. Driving around 55 mph. I notice my three children were looking out the back of my van and I could not see behind me. I asked them what they were doing and they said Mommy we are kind of scared there is something following us it is a bright white light. I asked how long it has been following us? They said shortly after we got out side of town where there was no lights. I looked and seen what they were talking about and I slowed down to about 20 miles mph. It did get closer quickly and it was following us. This road was a back road and we only seen maybe two cars pass by.  The kids stared screaming Mom it is getting closer I looked and it was. I started speeding up to about 55 mph it did to I went 70 mph well it did two. I noticed that the oval shape light was moving in and out in between trees and an unbelievable amount of speed. I knew I was about 30 miles from the interstate I85. I speed up to 80 mph and it speed up to still weaving in between the trees. It scared the scrap out of me. Being chase and not knowing what in the world this craft was. Kids were scared and crying by this time. I increase my speed to 95 mph it did to. Now it is by this time to close and still doing the zigzag through the trees. I was to scared to slow down and scared of going to fast. I saw a light tower ahead and I knew we were getting closer to the interstate. It was almost as time just froze in place a deer just jumped in front of the van and I don’t know why but I hit the head light button and turned the head lights off and the deer eyes locked into my eyes and it jumped really high and continued to the woods when it landed I had just hit my brakes at that time but not enough to even come close to stop just an attempt to but the deer was on the side of the road in perfect condit! ion and looking at us like we were crazy.  I then saw a car on coming going toward the light it had no more passed my and it slammed on breaks and stopped the car half on the road and other half off the road they got out with doors left open and they were heading for the ditch. I had hit my brakes during this and slowed way down. I think because we were so close to the interstate and lots of lights and activity it retreated and disappeared within a matter of seconds. I stopped and the car that those people that had passed me stood up with their hand in the air pointing at the object. It disappeared. I have never felt so much relief in my life and a since of calmness came about the children and I. Weird it was actually chasing us. Those people got back in their cars and continued going in that direction. I will say I have never been down that road again! I have never experienced anything like that in my whole life and I am now 50.  The technology of this aircraft light or what ever you want to call it to be able to travel at such unbelievable speeds through the tree zigzagging. I don’t even want to know or think about it?  This really happed! People looked at me as if I was crazy when I told them what had happened but I told them to ask the children what happened on the drive back from North Carolina. When the children came up to me I told them to ask they did and all three at the same time all chimed in telling them the same things I had just told them. The look on their faces was priceless. I was glad that the children were with me but at the same time I wished they hadn’t been with me. I don’t even want to think what would have happened if I had of stopped long before we got to the expressway. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

This was a long time ago but I will never forget these incidents. The funny thing was I didnt really care that much at the time but as the years go by I realize I saw something amazing.  The first one happened in the fields outside of Cody on the Powell highway. A friend and I were driving back into Cody from Powell at around 10-11 pm. We were coming into town and all of a sudden a  bright set of two orange lights slowly lifted out of one of the fields off to the right of the highway.  They were obviously attached to some sort of craft and possibly the light from some sort of engine, similar to a helicopter taking off but it moved slower at first and than faster , it slowly rose up out of the field and shot into the sky gaining speed as it ascended.  We were quite close , maybe within a mile of the object.  It was dark outside so I could not tell what shape the object was but it definitely had a solid mass to it. I would estimate the size to be about the size of a small to medium sized aircraft , perhaps 50 feet across. It had two orange lights that almost appeared to be rocket engines but not exactly. I could clearly see a huge cloud of thick exhaust coming from the object as it moved into the sky, illuminated by its own orange glowing “engines”. It was far to big to be a fireworks device or anything like that. It moved up in an arc but it rose up slowly , not really like a rocket, more like a helicopter. We were in a car and did not stop but we heard no noise which a helicopter that close would certainly have made.   The other strange thing about this is anyone from Cody knows this is only about a mile from the airport up on the hill. If this was a conventional aircraft why would it take off from a hayfield and not the airport, which was only a mile away?  I can not remember the exact date , I would guess this was April or May.  The next sighting was about 8 months later in January. I lived in Wapiti and was driving home from Cody at night. It was eerie and very quiet that night and snowing lightly. As I was driving past the Buffalo Bill Reservoir. I noticed an extremely bright white light to the left of me in the sky maybe about 500 feet in the air directly over the reservoir. This time I stopped my car because I thought it was a helicopter with a search light looking for something in the water. I turned off my engine and stepped out of my car. To my amazement it was dead quiet outside and not a soul was around. Very spooky. I watched the light shining down through the snow and it was mesmerizing. It was a brilliant white , just like a very bright searchlight.  I watched it for a few minutes and then something even weirder happened. As I watched it it slowly faded out like someone turned down a dimmer switch and at PRECISIELY the same time another white light faded on about a mile away toward the dam. The two lights were unmistakably connected somehow because  exactly as one faded out the other came on, almost like the object just teleported to another location a mile away. I suspect it was two different objects that were coordinating their signals. . This actually scared me and I got in my car and left. I never heard a single sound at all. It was absolutely quiet. The lights never moved at all , they stayed hovering in the same spots the whole time.  I have since talked to friends and two other people I know have seen similar things over the same reservoir.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,44.4023,-109.5347

A large Air Force Base (Hill Field), is located just fifteen miles North of Bountiful City, and another fourth-five miles West of Salt Lake (Dugway Proving Grounds), although I’ve never thought these facilitys were related to the sittings,  The first sitting was approximately around the middle of July in 1996, at about 12:35am MST.  I was twenty years old at the time, standing outside my family’s home in Bountiful in the company of three friends socializing.  As an avid star gaze in the hot summer nights, I took a short moment to gaze up at the stars, when my eyes had caught the attention of something out of place.  Looking around I notice an object blacking out the night sky.  After a few seconds my eyes were able to adjust and focus to the description of a Black Triangle Craft.  The Craft was traveling in a South direction taking it right over the Utah State Capital Building and Down Town Salt Lake City Area.  The altitude here in Bountiful is approximately 4,500 ft above sea level, and the Black Triangle Craft appeared to be another 2,000 ft above ground level, thus easily clearing the small mountain range that separated Bountiful from the down town Salt Lake City area.   Although this Craft could have been at a much higher altitude thus causing me to have a limited ability to give a true description of size, it appeared to have a wing span greater of 200 yards.   I was however able to see the bottom of this Craft was flat, and it appeared to have some unknown design or odd markings that spread over the entire surface.  There was no lights that could be seen, for this Craft was completely black and passed right over the top of me without ever making a sound.  The Black Triangle Craft seemed to glide across the midnight sky, and gave a real strange feeling of something foreign to this world and the technologies we posses.

It was one or one-thirty in the morning on a warm summer night in July.  I was only five years old at this time.  My window was open in my bedroom on the first floor of my house, facing towards the backyard.  I had abruptly awoken to a loud humming sound coming from outside.   After a few seconds, I noticed a blue light that seemed to be coming from my open window.  At first, it was very faint and hardly noticeable; but after the course of a few minutes (three to five), the blue light had become so bright that it covered everything in my field of vision.   I tried to go and get my parents, but I was paralyzed, either out of shock from the event or from an unknown force.  All of the sudden, I felt a presence in the room.   At first I was scared, but then I felt a strong reassurance that the presence was not there to harm me.  Then, with an overwhelming flash of white light, the buzzing sound stopped and the blue light disappeared.   After this, I was able to move, and went to the windows to see what had happened.  I looked out into the lawn, and everything looked eerily still.  The trees weren’t moving, the grass wasn’t waving, and there wasn’t a single ripple in the pool.   Since that day, I have never seen that blue light again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2008-06-12T00:00:00,39.7401,-90.2388

I had just gotten home from my aerobics class (I was getting in shape to go elk hunting) and I was unloading grocerices. It was calm, starry night with light winds. I was going back and forth from my truck to the house carrying groceries and I noticed this triangle shaped object over on the rock quarry property hovering vertically. It made no noise, had three lights, and was totally transparent. As I went to the truck for another load of groceries, I noticed that this object was moving closer to the house. I went into the house and put the groceries on the counter and went back outside and stood on the patio and watched this object, still hovering vertically, approach the house and stop about two (200) hundred yards away from me. This was a perfectly still night and I could still hear the crickets chirping, yet, I could not hear any sound coming from this object that was about as wide as two of my trucks placed end to end. The top left and bottom lights were white, but the top right light turned from white to red and then to orange. I could literally see the stars through this object; it was totally transparent. I stood there and watched this object for about five (5) minutes before I went over to my truck and called my friend, Chris. When I moved towards the truck, which was about twenty five (25) yards away, this object moved so that it could look at me with an unobstructed view. I called my friend then I called my Mom and told them what I was looking at. I don't lie about anything-period-and they knew that I was serious. After I got off of the phone with them, I watched this object for another five (5) minutes and did something that truly blew my mind, as if seeing this thing wasn't enough. This object, still hovering constantly, made a vertical move, then a downward move, and then took off at the speed of light. It was gone. No trails. No streaks. Gone in an instant. Vanished. I stood there in total awe and then when I came to, I hopped in my truck and raced to the other end of the p! roperty to see if I could find any burn marks or other evidence. I found nothing. I immediately called the Belton Police Department and asked if there had been some reports of strange craft sighted between Belton and Peculiar. They said ""no."" I then made a call to the Cass County Sheriffs office and asked them if there were any operations being performed either out of Whiteman Air Force Base or the old Richards Gebaur Air Force Base.

The red marker on the top is approximately where I was as I walked east.  The craft was observed flying east over the train tracks (just outside the complex) after it had flown past the silos (which you will also see in the photo).  In my original report, I estimated the lateral distance between myself and the craft to be ""60 meters.""  This map has helped me to provide a much more realistic distance (just 24 meters!).  As discussed with the NUFORC, the altitude of the craft could still be estimated at 100-130 meters.  But, the main point of the estimate is that the craft was VERY close and VERY low.  From the point at which the craft was observed, it made a right turn and accelerated to terrific speed as it moved south, and out of sight.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,33.42126454293629,-111.772797322253

I imidiatly saw a bright orange/amber light about 30-40 deg. above the horrizon.  I then ran due east to the edge of the parking lot to gain darker skies. There is a field direcly east of the store, with less light pollution.  We stood for about 10 minutes, facing east and watching this ""object"" move from left to right. It paralleled the horizon in that its over all altitude with respect to our location deviated only slightly as it stopped and remained motionless for up to 20 seconds. It stopped 3 times. Each time the object began to move again, its altitude remained some what stable. It did not appear to move on an exactly strait path but the deviation in alltitude was minimal.  When I first saw the object, it was large compared to regular air traffic. If I tried to ""pinch"" the object with my thumb and index finger, arm strait, the object would be 1/8"" to 1/4"".

The object lost some brightness and some size, but it still apeared larger and brighter than any normal air traffic.  also, I did not see the object ""pause"" until it had encountered the marine layer. This is where the object lost some of it's disk like appearance. I mean disk like the sun, and not like a frisbee.  Before the fog there was a slight whiteness to the center of the object, but it remained mostly dark orange, not red, but a rich orange that I have never seen on any air craft. I have seen orange in many air craft lights, but never that rich and intense a color.  The only noise we could hear was our own conversation and speculation with respect to the object.  The object gradually began to deminish in size and brightness and did look like commom air craft in the last minute and then dissapeared. In the last quarter of our observations, the object looked very much like Mars did the last time Mars was at it's brightest.

I saw the mountain this particular morning and it had a layer of clouds surrounding its flanks and the early day sun shining on the north side. So I grabbed my Canon 30D and mounted it's EF 75 - 300 mm f4 - 5.6 IS USM lens. I took a total of 4 shots, the first with just a UV filter, then added a polarized filter for the last 3. Then I scrolled through the 4 images on the camera monitor to pick the best one and deleted the other 3. I noticed in the one that I kept, 3 dark dots in the blue sky above the mountain. I have taken many images with birds or aircraft between the mountain and here and when you download into the computer, you can tell that is what they are - either birds or aircraft. Not in this case! These were certainly disk or cigar shaped. I snapped this particular image at 1/640 second and an aperture value of f9.0. The ISO was at 400, giving the 'grain' or 'noise' in the shot. My computer monitor is not that sharp, but I have viewed it on others that were. These also were not specks of dust on the imager, which I would have seen on the other shots. I have showed this to others, whom thought they looked rather odd.

The object approached from the west, and maintained a steady trajectory towards the east, curving gently towards the south as it passed. At first it appeared to be an airplane, but it never resolved into any singular airplane shape. Sometimes it appeared to be a biplane flying in an extreme crab, sometimes it looked like a star. From first sighting, its shape was constantly moving, in a rotational manner, with a period of approximately 12 seconds. At its closest approach, it appeared that there were many (c. 20) discrete shapes rotating around the center. It maintained an overall spherical aspect at all times, and the rate of internal motion never changed. One observer saw the rotation as around a perpendicular axis. It seemed that the front of the object shifted its shape less, while the rear (as it travelled) seemed at times to be anemone-like, though with slower motion.  The object remained black, never showing any other colors, nor reflecting any light, though it didn't seem to pass into any sunlight. As it passed, both of us saw what appeared to be a halo around the object, perfectly circular, about a third of the object's diameter further out from its center. The halo appeared as an indistinct lighter ring, with a slightly darker ring around it. One observer felt it was a lens-like effect.  Its apparent speed was comperable to a light airplane, and its apparent altitude was also comperable to where a light airplane would fly, as it remained beneath all clouds. A rain storm had recently passed, and the cloud deck was moderately high - not low, but not as high as airliners travel.  One of us grew up around airplanes, and has been obsessed with them in varying degrees for his whole life. He is a musician, and has a strong background in the sciences.

It was sometime between 7:30 and 8:30 P.M..  My recliner seat in my jacuzzi at that time faced the north.  I could see planes coming in from the northwest every couple of minutes which I assume were coming in from Las Vegas and they still fly that same pattern today.  As I was looking what would be due north I notice 5 lights heading straight this way as if they were following I-17.  I was thinking I was going to see maybe the concord. The lights were not real high off the horizon when I noticed them.  I set an watched them coming in anticipation to see what they are.  At a distance they looked like they were in a straight line.  As they got closer they gained in altitude gradually and I could see a V formation.  There is a tree in the lot behind my house that they went behind for just a few seconds.  When they got on the south side of the tree I was amazed at how they had even gotten higher in the sky.  The lights never broke there V formation.  I could see that this was one object of an enormous size.  The lights flew directly over Phoenix while gaining altitude at an accerlerated speed.  I watch the lights along with my Mom and cousin Katy.  As the lights gained in speed and altitude the craft made a straight angle turn with no curve in its turn.  It was simply amazing.  I have seen footage over the years and only one  video showed the same object or one similiar to what we seen.  The lights that supposedly appeared down in south phoenix I do believe were flares.  The object I witnessed was flying and had no sound at all.  It is way to big for any aircraft that we as the general public no of.

It didn't take long for us to drive from home, to the travel center, for me to run back and get back out to the car park. I think it was probably about 22:15 when we were leaving the travel center parking lot. As we were driving toward the traffic lights at the interchange, my mother had asked me what that streak across the sky was, and the object that was hovering high above the town. I had to squint hard to see it at that time, and at first dismissed it as Venus, as the twinkling colours looked the same. Then I realised that Venus was in the opposite (Eastern) part of the sky!  We drove down North Park Drive to Aspinwall Street, and had nearly a dozen blocks to go before we arrived home. As we drove west down Aspinwall Street, the object started to become larger. Two blocks from home, it was apparent that this craft was waiting for us at the end of the street (it's a dead-end). At the same time, on the same block, my aunt's boyfriend was outside their home throwing out the rubbish and spotted this craft.  The craft was shaped like a equilateral triangle, silver in colour. The strangest part was it looked only like an outline of a triangle. It moved up and down, side to side, in a very quick manner. Like a helicopter, but with a million times more precision and speed. Its maneuvers were amazing-- I had never seen anything like it. The craft was riddled with several lights along the 'outline' of the triangle. They were mostly white, but would periodically change from white, to red and then to blue. As it moved, there was a sort of red and blue aura around it, and there were trails coming from these lights.  My mother drove the car to the very end of West Aspinwall Street. That area of the street is a dead end, blocked by a large hill. On the north side at the end of W. Aspinwall street, there is rather large empty field. My mother drove to the empty field and turned off the car lights, as well as the engine. I had her roll down the window. The craft was probably 150-200 feet above us (rough estimation), a bit to the west (above the hill). It's hard to tell the size of the craft; I'd say if I extended my arm all the way out, and made a fist, the sides of the craft would have been visible by about three inches or so. I'm not keen when it comes to distance measurements, so I could be off on how far up the craft was in the sky.  There was absolutely no noise coming from the craft. My mother started the car again, and we started to drive through the field. This is where I got very alarmed-- if our car was moving, it would move with us. If my mother would stop the car, it would stop its movements. My mother was trying to convince me to run in the house and grab a video camera, and my 35mm camera. There was no way I was getting out of that car! I urged her to drive back to the busy travel center we had just left from, as I felt safer there, amongst many people.  We drove back to the travel center and stayed in the car park and watched the craft hover, but slowly ascend until it was a small speck in the sky, then we saw it dart off to the west at an alarming rate of speed. After it dashed off, it was no longer visible.  This sighting, coincidentally, occurred on the same night as the Heaven's Gate suicide in the San Diego, Ca. area. We had arrived home around 23:00, just in time for Nightline (Ted Koppel). The feature story was on the mass suicide and the whole story involving the Hale Bopp comet. I honestly don't believe these two incidents were connected. They just happened to occur on the same night.  The following evening, my mother and I went to my aunt's house (she lived two blocks east of us). Her boyfriend kept asking us if we had gone out the previous night, and definitely  beat around the bush regarding what he saw. He wouldn't come out and say it-- he wanted to know if we had seen anything. When we both confirmed that there was something in the sky, he showed me the drawings he made and description he wrote out. It was the same exact thing we saw.  At the time of the sighting, I was working for the local newspaper as an editorial assistant and photographer. I didn't report this to any local authorities, nor did I mention the incident to anyone I worked with, although the newspaper's editor did mention a rash of phone calls that came in to the local police department.  Additionally, one of the local police officers had come into my mother's hair salon for a haircut, and had mentioned to my aunt (his hairdresser; same aunt I previously mentioned, whose boyfriend saw the craft at the end of our street) that approximately two dozen reports had been made that night. It was then that she told the officer what her boyfriend saw.  My mother and I heard from friends that there were sightings of the same craft the following night, in the Camp Verde/Cottonwood/Clarkdale area of Arizona.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,35.1013,-110.6473

I had the urge to look up into the south sky (opposite direction from the comet) and saw what to the best of my recollection was either the front of a disc or a large batman type of wing floating overhead. I called loudly to my husband to come out and witness this, as I knew he would not believe me. He came out just in time to see the craft go over the house to the north. It was above the streetlight and it appeared to be round. While it was overhead, it was not visible, as though looking only at the sky. It could only be seen on the cusps of the craft. It flew off and curved right away to the northwest after passing over our home. I watched the news that night hoping others may have seen this, but there were no reports of it. My husband at the time was teaching at a local college. The next day he asked if anyone had seen anything odd the night before, whereupon one did tell that he and his girlfriend also saw something similar in the sky the prior evening, while watching for the eclipse. The thing that was confusing to me was that, in my mind, an object that appeared that size would fall out of the sky, were it flying so smoothly and at such a low speed. It seemed to be on cruise at a low speed. The only other solution to this speed is that it could have been much larger and much higher, appearing smaller and closer. However, we could see the streetlight in front of our house reflecting onto the back of the cusp or disc as it flew off. I have tried to do a search on the internet to see if others spotted this ufo during the Eclipse and Hale-Bopp, however, the only other thing I have found was references to Heaven's Gate. I/we were never in the slightest interested in cults.

My wife and I were driving north on 15th Ave Ne near Northgate Mall when she called my attention to a triangle pattern of three white lights, one at each corner, not far above us, maybe 200 yards in a diagonal line of sight. It was clear the lights were part of one solid object although it was too far to make out any details of the craft. I had been living in the Seattle area for all of my 28+ years at the time including living next to the Renton airport for several years. I have seen many types of aircraft from commercial to fighter planes and this looked nothing like anything I had seen before. The sunroof  was open when she let out what I would guess is the usual reaction: “what the!”. I am one who looks for a logical explanation when confronted with something I can’t immediately explain and figured at first glance it was a stealth fighter. I had seen one at about the same distance but I immediately realized that there was no sound. Stealth technology may make these planes almost invisible on radar but when I saw one it was far from silent. Also, there were only the three white lights. No red and blue warning lights that you see on a typical airplane. We both had a very eerie feeling as we couldn’t make sense of it. When we got home that night we saw on the news that “strange lights” were seen in the Seattle area that night and were dismissed as space debris from a falling satellite that crashed into the Pacific Ocean. Ok, a plausible explanation except we were heading north and the object was heading from west to east at that point, and that’s a really long way to get to the Pacific.  I can’t imagine space debris is capable of changing direction. I have since seen footage of an old Russian satellite that fell out of orbit a few years back and was filmed by a fishing boat crew as it came down and burned up in the atmosphere. It looked nothing like what we saw. Three lights in a triangular pattern that appeared to be one object, flying low and slow with no running noise. I am one who p! refers t o go from A to B instead of A to Alien but what we saw was very similar to video footage I have seen on tv of  triangle shaped objects with three or more lights on the bottom.. The lights were evenly spaced and were moving very slowly, but being one who prefers a rational explanation,I probably would have accepted the news explanation and forgotten about it. The fact they said it landed in the Pacific when what we saw it CLEARLY heading east has always bothered me, that and I am 99.9% sure what I saw was not space debris. I have searched a couple of databases (yours and MUFON) but haven’t seen anything else that sounds like what we saw. Enough people saw it that it was mentioned on the news but I cant find any other reports. I am not sure what year it was, only that it was between 1995 and 1998.

Mentioned on local news as well. After watching Larry King this evening I decided to reflect on a UFO sighting that I had. While traveling on a major road in Port Saint Lucie I and other people in the vicinity spotted un identified flying objects above a line of trees on the eastern side of the road. The other cars slowed down as did I. The incident was actually reported briefly on the 11:00 PM local news that evening. I would need to look for the exact date but it was in the 1997-1999 range. It was a Saturday. I can find the exact date because my husband had a golf tournament that day. We have some dated souvenirs from the event. At the BBQ after the tournament I shared what I had seen with some close friends. Later that evening the news cast mentioned it. They had had some calls and therefore asked various military and weather experts about activity in the area. No valid earthling events had been occurring that match what people had seen. The road is adjacent to Port Saint Lucie Blvd. It runs into the turn pike entrance. It is a north /south roadway connecting Port Saint Lucie Blvd to another major roadway. I was traveling with my four children. My children saw the objects also but were rather young at the time and more interested in their play toys than what Mom was seeing or saying. The objects were disc like in shape. They hovered above the tree line. As fast as I saw them, was as fast as they left. To the best of my recollection there were two to three. As other people that have seen UFOs can probably attest to, by the time I processed what I was seeing they were gone. The string of cars on the road all slowed down to get a closer look at what we were witnessing. On hind sight, I wish we had all pulled over to share what we had just witnessed and exchanged contacts. But as I said, when it actually is happening the feeling of shock and disbelief is rather overwhelming. All I know is what I saw and that I will not forget it. I am a professional of sound mind and body. I was not under the influence of anything and have no reason to make this up. Actually with the stigma attached to those that claim to see UFOs, it isn’t something that I’d invent for attention. In my profession, making “crazy” claims can lead to career fall outs. I am happy to see that so many creditable people have seen object that can’t be identified and are coming forward to share their sightings. In closing, do you think the ants know we are here? As they build their intricate ant hills and communicate with each other, they most likely have no idea we are functioning as a society. We know the ants are here but really take no special interest in them on a daily basis. Some ants may encounter human beings but have no real idea how to incorporate that into their “ant universe”. For me, the same concept can be applied to UFOs and human beings. Thank you for providing this valuable web site. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Then, directly overhead, I noticed three star-like objects in triangle formation moving south to north.  I had originally been unsure whether I was seeing one large triangular object or three separate objects.   Then I noticed that I could see stars between the moving objects and decided that they must be separate objects.  Also, after that determination was made, at least one of the objects made very quick movements out of the formation, then back in, although the triangle was not the same shape afterwards.  The triangle kind of bent and warped as it moved, so I surmise that all of the objects were probably moving in varying patterns.  I looked for any signs of strobes or running lights, but found none.  This was a very strange feeling to see this.  The fluid motion of the triangle gave the feel that these things could just move any way they wanted to.  As for the size, the objects were about as large and the same brilliance as a star.  The triangle they formed itself approximately as wide as my fist when I held up my outstretched arm.  Whatever they were, they were way way up there.   No sound.  No lights.  I would have thought they were maybe satellites or something.  But moving around like that, I really don't think so.  Now, I know a lot of people are going to probably say these were planes or jets, since I do live in the flight path of a major airport about 40 miles away (DFW).  But I am telling you this were not planes.  They just did not move like that, the snakelike movement of them individually, making that triangle fluid.

I would say that I watched them from about 90 degrees to about 60 degrees before I lost them in the lights.  Very strange.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,32.468,-96.9873

This entire event happened within a five minute period and I had 4 other eyewitnesses.  I noticed this object in the sky while helping my son fly a kite in the park. It took me about thirty seconds to realize it was not a kite as it was about 300 feet higher than the kite I was flying. The object seemed to be stationary, but I soon realized that it was slowly moving higher and vertical.  As I ran to another friend also flying a kite and asked him ""what's that in the sky"" he was baffled as well. I then grabbed my camera and start taking pictures. My camera is expensive and takes great shots but I'm an amateur photographer and could not lock the focus on an object that was moving away, getting smaller and had nothing but blue sky's and clouds as a backdrop.  I took a total of 10 pictures and to my amazement, one out of ten came out perfectly clear (by luck) to reveal something that is very hard to explain. I cannot describe the object other than it looks like a very large white camera with a large lens looking downward with four booster rockets and two fuel pods all of which are perfectly symmetrical in shape!  Yeah, I know; crazy huh?  As I tried to rationalize what it might be, I dismissed that it was a weather balloon, US aircraft, satellite and defiantly not a kite. What ever it was, it wasn't moving with the wind and it was still visible far beyond the cloud layer meaning that the sunlight was reflecting off of this object.  I dare not show or send this photo out to anyone unless they are willing to pay very well for it. If there really are aliens and spaceships from another world, I may have one of few real pictures as proof!  The most logical but still crazy explanation I can come up with other than it being from another world is that some foreign country has developed advance spying technology that can silently hover over American land and then return home at altitudes over 40,000 feet!",2006-10-30T00:00:00,21.32260015003751,-157.84012865716429

I noticed that there were many commercial aircraft being diverted from the airspace in which the show was taking place as i saw plane after plane pass i then noticed an object near the airspace in which the planes were flying. At first i thought it was just another plane but then i noticed it was stationary in the sky and there was no sound that i could hear coming from it. The object then dissapeared and reappeared again and then did the same about two times more. I tried to get a video but i could not find the object i was seeing in the viewfinder as the sun was in my eyes and also the object was so small. I instead went to get my Dad who came out but when he did the object was no longer there. I thought no more of it and continued on with the watch for planes in the skies and now i was watching for UFO's also. This sighting occured at around 1:50pm on July 30th 2006.  A few hours past and then at around 4:55pm i noticed an object the same to the one i had seen at 1:50pm going across the sky to the west i aimed my camera and pressed the record button but i did not know were to aim the camera as the object was not appearing in the viewfinder the sighting lasted for seconds and i got some very poor footage but its still footage i would like to show.

The night was very clear -- having very few light clouds in the sky.  I can't remember the moon, so it must not have been very visible at that time.  I was sitting in the house, watching a television program while perusing through old newspapers. Now, Mom is quite a skeptic in UFOs, so it was rather surprising for her to come inside and ask me if I could identify what planet was shining up in the northwest.  I wasn't up-to-date on what celestial events were happening that night, so I just went to look and see what she was questioning.  When I went onto the back porch, I could immmediately see a very bright white light in the northwest corner of the sky -- about 40-45 degree angle from the horizon.  Mom told me she had been watching this light for quite a few minutes before coming to get me, so her interest was sparked.  As I watched the light I noticed it was slowly moving toward us.  Mom was hesitant about my saying it was moving, since she had watched it for so long.  However she did notice the movement after a few seconds.  The light headed straight in our direction (southeast from it's original point) at a rather steady pace -- somewhat the same as a plane coming into landing.  (We live just a few miles from Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport, so we do know what planes look like and recognize landing lights or directional/warning lights.)  There were no blinking lights alongside the one bright light, so we were baffled.  As the light came nearer to the house -- still traveling in a southeast direction -- we noticed the strangest thing of all -- there was no sound coming from the object.  NO SOUND!  And the object was coming just over the house. As it passed directly over our house, I noticed something rather startling -- two smaller lights suddenly appeared behind the bright light.  This aspect gave the shape of the object a triangular appearance.  I was stunned!  Mom was rather excited, since she had never witnessed anything like this before -- especially taken by the fact of no sound coming from the object.  The object passed over the edge of the house's roofing, so I ran through the house to the front door -- about five seconds timing.  When I got out the front door to look where the object was going, it had disappeared.  The view from the front road to the night sky is rather wide, so I was surprised not to be able to see the object anymore. A couple of days later, we were mentioning this to my younger sister, who had worked at the Port of Greater Baton Rouge at that time.  She was excited, because a co-worker (both security guards) had told her of a very strange light which had played around the port for a few minutes.  The original witness had thought it was a helicopter -- except for the fact there was no sound coming from the object. I had asked for my sister to have this witness write her story down, but the witness was too frightened to do so.  This is why I am reporting this sighting now -- on August 21, 2006.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,30.4595,-91.3428

I was driving past the primary power distribution site for the local hydro power facility near Cornwall, Ontario, Canada. The facility is on the high ground about a mile from the road. I noticed a bright shaft of light above this facility. I thought at first it might be a helicopter inspecting the transformers. The light was extremely bright and well defined. There was no sound. I then realized that it was too wide for a normal spotlight - possible 100 feet wide. The light then acted in a manner not possible with our technology. Still bright with well defined boundaries it began to slowly withdraw upward.  The object that it was withdrawing into was not visible. Light in our technology is either on or off. A light beam as we know it cannot slowly withdraw. The light boundaries were too well defined to be a natural phenomenon. For this reason I believe I was witnessing a paranormal event.

During the second film I was looking up into the night sky and noticed just how beautiful the stars were in the moonless, cloudless sky. After a couple of minutes I noticed a brilliant white light moving horizontically through the night sky at what seemed to be at a super fast speed (Note: it was not a falling star - I've seen a million of those and they move at a much slower pace and tend to be falling down in the sky this object moved sideways). The light traveled in a perfectly straight line over 90% of the entire body of the night sky. I had my wife observe it as well. We watched it move to the corner of the sky at which time it made a perfect 45 degree angled turn upward (not like a falling star) into the sky (I've never seen anything cut an angle like that). Then in just two seconds, the moving object proceeded to go into some kind of hyper-speed and it looked like a stepping stone in the sky and then it gradually faded out forming a blurry intermittent line and then vanished.

We live North of Dallas in McKinney Texas, with an unobstructed view to the South. I have grown up around aircraft and I am very knowledgeable about most types of air planes. Our house seems to be located in a position that gets a large amount of Care-Flight helicopters either directly over, or very near our location. We were watching the air traffic coming and going out of Love Field, DFW and Addison airport, always trying to figure out who was going where. We noticed what we assumed to be a Care-Flight or a private plane headed directly towards us from Love Field (due South). It was a bright red/orange light that resembled a bright landing light or a spot light on the front of a helicopter that was pointed towards us from a distance of approximately 10 – 15 miles and at a low altitude of 500 – 1500 agl (above ground level). After several minutes, we noticed that the aircraft never seemed to get any closer. At that time I got my binoculars out to get a better look at what was going on. The only thing that I could tell was that the red/orange light was all that I could see. I thought I should have been able to see a rotating beacon and anti-collision lights. After a total of approximately 5 - 6 minutes, the light moved due West. Now that I had what should be a side view of the craft, I knew that I could see the rotating beacon and the anti-collision lights. Not only were there no other lights, the spotlight seemed to still be pointed to the North. This is when we both knew we were seeing something that just wasn’t quite right. It was moving to the West at about the speed a fast moving helicopter would be going at a distance of about 5- 10 miles. After a few more minutes, it stopped again. Trying to rationalize what we were seeing, I thought a larger aircraft descending out of the South towards Love Field and then turning towards DFW (this may be possible due to the ru! nways at Love are 33 – 13 and DFW are 36 – 18), but we still couldn’t figure out why the light was that bright and moving that slow. The light was now standing still over DFW for another 4 – 5 minutes. As we were both watching this thing, it went due South over the horizon in a fraction of a second. After we could see the light move over the horizon, I had the feeling that the light was much larger and higher than what we had first assumed. I now believe it was approximately 5,000 agl, assuming that it was indeed over Love Field and DFW. The size of the light was approximately the size of a bb at arm’s length. The next morning we anxiously watched the news for a story on this light over Dallas, there was no mention of anything. I called the towers at Love Field, DFW and approach control via land line and no one knew anything about what we had witnessed the night before. I just pray that it was ours.

As I focused on the object it slowly descended behind the ridge top; a smaller whitish-blue light at the top of the object flashed once (like a strobe light) before it disappeared. It's hard to say how large the object actually was, but the ridge summit is about one-half mile from my house, and the object looked somewhat like the size of the sun as it rises or sets.

The sound was similar to a jet engine, but pervasive, louder, and seemed to almost vibrate the house.  (It was loud enough to be heard/felt inside a well-insulated house with TV on, for example).  The roaring sound(s) persisted over most of the 30-40 minute period, but may have been multiple (up to six?) discrete events.  On about the fourth event, I personally witnessed a light moving from directly above me to the SE.  the roaring sound came directly from the direction of the light.  For the first few seconds the light appeared to be a fast-moving aircraft (I thought it was a fighter).  The problem is, it was so high that I should never have been able to hear the sound of its engines.  If a commercial or military jet had been low enough to hear, I should have been able to distinguish separate lights (wing lights, etc.)  I couldn't.  This object was just a white-to-maybe-orangish point of light accompanied by a loud roaring sound.  Before it passed out of view over my house, it veered dramatically left, then right, then left again.  I don't want to suggest it was spiraling, but that is what I thought at the time.  It maneuvered much faster than any commercial jet vehicle could have moved (in my field of view at the percieved altitude).  There may have been more than one UFO, as the roaring continued over about 30 minutes, either rising and falling, or multiple events in sequence.  I called the 911 dispatecher and reported the event at approximately 10:15 PM and she confirmed the sound, but at this time, neither of us could find a light in the direction the sound was coing from.  The night sky was absolutely clear.  I first became aware of the roaring when my girlfriend's son called me from across town to report both the sound and that he had drawn a picture of the moon because it had a funny shadow.

It was exactly shaped, sized, bright and distant as a common star, but it slowly moved for around 30 seconds till it seemed to disappear in the distance. After a few minutes we both spotted another ""moving star,"" it looked just like the previous and was observed for around the same amount of time.

These moving stars may sound like shooting stars, though 4 of them did move from top to bottom as if falling, one of them moved up wards. Something I never encountered in a shooting star. And all 5 sightings were too long observed, and moved in a slow manner compared to a shooting star.  Also, while moving these objects seemed to slightly change direction. They moved in a straight matter yet slightly changed angel as they moved. One of the objects at one point, seemed to slightly move in a zigzag manner, just long enough for us to confirm it with each other, as it then disappeared in the distance.

In the center of the town is Offut Air Force Base, so perhaps the crafts that I have been seeing are somehow military-related.  Lately, me and several people I know have been seeing strange lights in the sky. The first occurence happened on probably about the tenth of august. My friend was in a park with his girlfriend, and they were staring at the sky, looking at stars that were out. Suddenly, their attention was drawn to a bright light that was hovering in the sky. It seemed to dance around in the sky for a few minutes. My friend then noticed several aircraft approaching the light. The light then took off directly into the sky and dissappeared from sight. The aircraft that had chased the light away then flew a grid in the sky and flew off out of sight.  Since this date, Me, my girlfriend, the two people stated above, and two of my other friends have seen strange shape-changing craft in the sky, all sightings occured on the same road, Harlan Lewis road, known as Base Lake road to the locals.  The first occurence I witnessed was on about the 18th of august. Me and my girlfriend were driving home and making a turn onto Harlan Lewis Road. We saw a helicopter approaching in the distance. As we drew closer to the helicopter, we thought it was changing shape. We were soon driving under this aircraft, which now resembled an X with several flashing lights on it. It stayed as this shape only while directly above us, then changed into the shape of an Airplane, and it changed the pattern of its flashing lights.  The second occurence what on the 23rd of august, when me, my girlfriend, and two of my other friends were driving down Harlan Lewis Road. One of my friends pointed out a helicopter that was flying not too far from us. It then flew behind some trees, out of view, and when it emerged from the other side of the trees, it had changed into the shape of an airplane, and also changed its light pattern and color. The other friend in the car didnt pay any attention to the sky during this, so he never saw anything. But everyone who did see it was 100% convinced that the aircraft changed shape.

I looked at the craft, and it was in the distance, perhaps hovering somewhere between me and Hoover Dam at 2:30 O’Clock position.  I saw it for maybe 2 or 3 seconds and then the winds made a huge howling sound (like a whoosh)  and the craft moved at lightning speed and disappeared straight on to the horizon, first bearing right then left.

I dismissed it as something crazy as it was near the approach of McCarran Airport in Las Vegas, but I never forgot it, and no one will ever convince me that I had not seen an alien craft.  It wasn’t a saucer shape though… it was different….it was square, perhaps on a curved edge, as it is hazy in my recollection.  However,  it was definitely not a “round” or “oval” vehicle.  There was a certain squareness to it, perhaps with angular edges.  I remember lights too, from the interior.  Anyhow, saw your piece on CNN and decided to submit this.  It’s what I experienced.

Hello,  Time & date mentioned above is approximate. It definitely took place during that week though.  The reason why I can be sure of this, was due to the time of year.  The end of the first week & beginning of the second week of August is the time of year when we get a lot of 'shooting stars'  My girlfiend & I drove from Longueil, (just south of Montreal) to Bromont, approx 45 minutes east of Montreal, to get away from the light pollution, so we could see the shooting stars better.  We were parked near Mont Shefford, a small ski hill.  While watching the sky for shooting stars, we observed a formation type craft.  There were several sections to it, however, it was a completely connected structure. It was large, about the 3/4 size of a football field.  It moved slowly across the sky (unknown in what direction).  There was no sound, complete silence. There were no bright lights on the object, however the object was brighter than the night sky, so I would say it was dimly lit. (I do not know if I should answer below if there were lights on it or not)  It is difficult to determine the distance from the ground to the object.  Minimum 2500 feet, probably more.  Our initial reaction was that we were looking at the the International Space Station. That was the only logical explanation we could come up with.  This theory was dismissed by a speaker at the Dow Planetarium in Montreal when we asked him if it was possible to see the Space Station from the ground.

As I stopped to let them catch up (and catch my breath), I gazed up into the the sky above us, and to my surprise there was a very large black. triangle shaped object.  It made no noise, and had no lights.   The reason it caught my attention was it was blocking out so many stars.   We live in an area that is in the flight path to the SLC International Airport, and we are used to constant air traffic overhead.  This object had to be larger than any passenger plane I have seen.   By now my wife and son were watching it too.  It moved from NW to SE over the valley.  We are fortunate to live just outside all of the city lights, otherwise I do not believe we would have seen it.   Also, It was impossible to judge height or speed.

It was a UFO that was cigar or rectangle shaped, bigger than a tour bus, dark gray colored, covered in round gold lights on the bottom, (10-12 lights)and had a bright orange ""comet tail"" on the end.

Unbelievable acceleration. A bluish neon round light (glow) underneath the aircraft. I was not aware there was a site like this or I would have reported this earlier. I was working the night shift in Kotzebue, Alaska.  I don't remember the exact date of my sighting but to the best of my recollection it was in October of 2002 at about 5:30 in the morning.  My work was such that I had to spend time outside. There was some snow on the ground, but I don't think it was more that a couple of inches. Looking out to the north of Kotzebue, I noticed a saucer shaped aircraft take off from about I would guess 1 to 3 miles north of Kotzebue. It was dark but with a partial moon I was able to discern the outline of a saucer shaped aircraft.  It took off at about an 80 to 85 degree angle. It started up relatively slowly but when it was perhaps 500 or so feet in the air, it accelerated very quickly. The whole sighting was over within 10 seconds or so.  That is how fast it was. It accelerated so quickly it was out of sight within about 10 seconds.  The interesting thing was the neon bluish round glow (plasma)that was underneath the aircraft.  Probably about a quarter the diameter of the entire saucer. I assume this was some kind of exhaust mechanism.  You would think I would have heard a noise as this aircraft took off but there was no noise. Complete silence. Again a very unusual neon bluish light, plasma (glow) underneath the aircraft which I assume was some kind of exhaust mechanism or what propelled the aircraft. After I saw this I called the police station in Kotzebue and asked if they had also seen something.  No, he said that he had not seen anything.  I think they had only one patrolman on duty as Kotzebue is a very small town and he was probably watching TV.  When my boss came in at 8:00 that morning I also told him what I saw.  He had been in Alaska several years and said other sightings had been made in Alaska over the years. Now that I look back I wish that I had gone north of Kotzebue and looked for any signs that the aircraft may have left in the snow.  I also wish I had called the air force down in Anchorage or Fairbanks to see if they had seen anything on their radar b! ut I did n't.  All I can say is this really happened.  I never really gave much thought to UFOs before this incident as I didn't believe in them.  But this one incident changed my views completely. I now know without a doubt that there are aliens visiting our planet and they are far superior to us technologically. Again, the speed of this saucer was unbelievable. And whatever they are using to propell their spacecraft is not like anything we have. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2008-06-12T00:00:00,,

While ona flight from St. Louis, MO to Cleveland, OH on Tues., Aug.1, after about 30 min into flight over central Illinois I was looking out the left window (north) of our Embraer 55 plane and observed what I initially thought was a another airplane flying parallel to our flight and above us...I had to look up at about a 30-40 deg angle.  The object was a very bright white slash of light about the length of arc that a dime would subtend at arms length.  What caused me to be very surprised at the sighting was that I could detect no wings or tail assembly.  It was totally cloudless blue sky and no contrail was observed from this ""object"".  Just after noticing this the pilot came on and announced that we had leveled out at our cruising altitude of 31,000 ft.  This meant that the object was considerably above us in altitude and if at 5 miles distance would likely have been at well over 40,000 ft - and unusual altitude for a commercial flight in good weather.  In any event, the object paralleled our course for about 2 mins and then appeared to receed to the north without ever changing the aspect ratio of its profile....thus it changed direction without appearing to turn as does an airplane.

It was a warm summer night and as we were driving we saw a low light in the sky about 5 miles in the distance. As we got closer we kept asking what is that?  It was moving slowly in the direct path of the expressway.  We had the sunroof open on the jeep and looked up as we passed directly under the object.  It was probably 100ft above my vehicle.  It did not make a sound, and was triangular shaped.  We both thought it was probably a stealth but couldn't imagine it flying that low, or that slow, and why it would be in the area.

I experienced this with my girl friend at the time, but while she admits to me that this happened it seems that this experience really freaked her out. She asked that I not include her in the story. I got home from work, stepped out of my car in the driveway when I heard a resonating vibration sound that seemed to drown out everything else.  I looked due East across the street and about fifty to one hundred feet above the houses was a large black cube sitting in the air.  The craft did not seem to have any lights and it did not move suddenly.   All I could do was stare; I thought of taking a picture and the camera was just inside the house, but I couldn’t move. It seemed as if time stopped. The cube was approximately the size of two homes in my neighborhood which would be about 3000sqft total; the outer texture like a borg cube on Star Trek.  The cube began to move slowly toward the south directly above the houses and I started to see a very light gray puff of smoke coming from what had become apparent to me was the rear of the craft. There were three light gray exhaust-like openings where the smoke was coming from, but the smoke very quickly dissipated as the craft moved south. I watched until the craft was too small on the horizon to see any longer; it was weird how no one seemed to be around except the person traveling with me that day until I could no longer hear the resonating vibration sound. Then when the cube was too far to distinguish, cars began passing by like normal and I saw neighbors coming and going; it was as if someone had their fingers in my ears and quickly removed them. I talked about the experience with the person traveling with me that day and their account was exactly what I had experienced. This happened about four to five years ago and I am still getting goose bumps and every hair on my body is standing up while I type this. I had never had anything like this happen before and have not since although I mentally prepare for the next encounter, hoping I can get a picture or video of this cube. Background: I was 25 years old at the time of this experience.  I am a non-denominational Christian and for the majority of my life never believed anything like this would ever happen to me.

He agreed that it was a good idea, so, he grabbed a cigarette, and we stepped outside.  We have a paved patio of sorts right out the backdoor and that was where we were standing when this unexplainable ""something"" came shooting out of nowhere. Out of habit, we both always end up looking at the sky in the evening in hopes of seeing a falling star, which is what we were doing at this point.  Suddenly, there it was. I yelled, ""Money, money, money"" as is my custom when I see a falling star, however, I realized before I even said the third ""money"" that this was not a falling star at all. When I first saw it, it was coming down fast, like a falling star would, but it kept coming, and it was getting bigger, and it had no tail, flame, or anything I've ever seen before. And before I could even blink, it was there, maybe 3 or 4 football field lengths above our house. It was an amber color, and it was shaped like a tylenol capsule. It was huge. It was giving off this amber light, yet, it wasn't like any kind of light I have ever seen in my life. It seemed to absorb the light around us as much as it seemed to be giving off the light as well. I realize this makes little sense, however, I am at a lack of words to explain it.  It stayed there. I have no idea how long. I ran out further into the yard when it then sped toward the center of the town we live in. We have a lot of trees in our yard which blocked my view, so I ran out into the street to see where it was. We have a building here, it's the tallest I believe in our town, and this craft hovered there above it. Again, I don't know how long it did, but it seemed about a minute. Then suddenly, it shot straight back up and utterly disappeared.  I do not know what this was. We immediantly came back inside, and went to a few sites that forcast or inform about any celestial happenings in the sky such as meteor showers, auroroa borealis, etc.. and there was nothing.

I had returned by bus to our family farm from Knoxville, TN.  The bus let me off on Kingston Pike. I had to walk along a paved road and then along our quarter-mile driveway.  The time was early evening and the area was pasture such that the view of the sky was clear.  After walking a moment, I noticed that a cigar shaped object was floating in the sky.  It was fairly far away but appeared to be huge! I was walking east and the object was to my south over what I estimate was Fort Loudon Lake.  At first I thought it must be a blimp...there were no glowing lights or windows: just a cigar shape with a prominent tailfin outlined by a red glow.  The red light falling on the 'tailfin' appeared to come from above and to the front of the craft--- also a red light was glowing on the bottom. I watched it with growing interest as I walked towards my house as the craft very slowly drifted foreward and downward.  When I reached the house I rushed in to get my step-uncle and a camera.  When we went back outside the object was gone. The next day we called McGee Tyson airport and they said there had been no blimps in the area for over three years.

However, it is noteworthy because they are relatively rare in the Los Angeles area since they cannot always be spotted from beneath the suburban and urban skies.

Grand Junction, Colorado has a busy airport with lots of jet traffic so seeing aircraft is a very common occurrence. As we walked the short distance to my house I spotted a very unusual craft flying and pointed it out to Debbi. This craft appeared to be approximately 140 ft. long, approximately 50 feet wide and nearly 40 feet thick. The craft had no lights, markings and no control surfaces. It was silver on the top and sides and appeared to be flying at approximately 150 m.p.h. as it approached our location. The craft approached our general location and gradually slowed to a hover. We had to look up to see the object at about 65 degrees above our heads. As best I can estimate, the object was perhaps a quarter of a mile (south) from our location and stopped flying and began to hover about half a mile (east) from our location at perhaps 8,000 foot level. Grand Junction is approximately 4600 above sea level and is surrounded by mountains that reach the 10,000 foot level 12 miles to the east. Craft was flying from west to east in direction. The craft made no noise at any time during flight or hover. The weather was clear and had scattered puffy cumulus clouds from 8-11 thousand foot level. Air traffic was light on that day. Craft was between the airport and the usual traffic pattern for the airport. No planes approached the craft or airport during observation. Total observation time was perhaps 20 minutes. At first we watched the craft fly toward our location then after passing our location it slowed to a stop and began to hover. After a couple minutes I went inside and obtained a pair of binoculars to see the craft better. It was easy to see with the naked eye but since I could not see markings, lights or control surfaces I was sure binocular would show some kind of control surfaces. After I brought the binoculars back outside I used them to see the craft with lots of detail. The binoculars were easily able to see lots of detail and confirmed that the craft was slowly rocking side to side; the craft had no control surfaces on the back or sides, no visible vent holes or windows or light fixtures. No markings of any kind. The texture of the crafts skin appeared to be similar to silver metal but no rivets or visible joints. It had a distinct division from top to bottom and the underside was shadowed from sunlight with a line half way between top and bottom with sharp edge in the middle of the craft running from front to back. The back was wider than the front but was very similar to the front of the craft. I have about 200 hours as a student pilot but have not been active in aviation for nearly 10 years but love aircraft; this was no aircraft I have ever seen before. I am retired from California state service as a psychiatric technician and currently work part time for the state of Colorado in the same capacity. My assumption is and was that this must have been some kind of experimental unmanned craft; perhaps a small electric powered gas filled craft. I was unable to understand how the craft flew with no noise and the only way it could hover without noise was if it was filled with gas. It was not a conventional design because the power source for flight had to be inside the craft but there were no signs of vents or rudders or elevators. A rotating jet of some kind inside the craft with vents that close up seemed the only possibility to me based on my limited knowledge of lighter than air craft. I have no memory of seeing the aircraft power it self after reaching our location and after some twenty minutes the clouds obscured our view of the aircraft. A general description of the craft would be a streamlined, smooth surface elongated clam shape. Stopping a craft near the approach pattern of an airport, behind a cloud seemed very foolish to me at the time. No reports heard of that or other sightings. Reluctant to mention the sighting because have no reason to believe that it was other than a man made experiment craft, but just not sure what it could have been.

The light randomly stoped moving from place to place, then two lights on each side of the center light, that were slightly smaller appeared simultaneously.

Dan and I had made a trip over to Pensacola (which is right next door to Gulf Breeze where all those alleged sightings took place back in the day). It was an afternoon in early November. The whole day had been overcast and you couldn't see anything but low, dark clouds.. the sun was never in sight. We were heading home over the Pensacola bridge, which is really long.. I was in the passenger seat looking out over the water, where I saw a very bright orange glowing something-or-other with 3 smaller orange glowing something-or-others hovering around it. We were going about 65 miles an hour and it appeared that the 4 objects were stationary. I always bring my digital camera when we go to P-Cola, so I moved quick to grab it and take a picture. When I finally got the camera on and ready, the 3 smaller objects were gone and only the large one remained. I managed to get one picture.. I didn't get anymore because I must have looked away for just long enough, that when I tried to capture it again, it was gone. I know we couldn't have been the only ones that saw it. There was plenty of traffic on the bridge and there were quite a few people fishing from the shore that was directly facing where the objects had been. It sucks that I didn't get a better or long enough view of the objects.. it all happened so quickly.. but I can still see it in my mind of it hovering below the cloudline. Like I said, I don't know what it was or that it was anything strange, even though it seemed totally out of place to anything I've ever seen in the sky. Some people bring up that it might have been flares.. could be. I don't remember seeing or hearing any passing aircrafts that would have been dropping them though. Other than that, what could it have been? It was in our immediate atmosphere, in the middle of the day, it couldn't have been any falling stars, comets or any of that stuff, could it? It wasn't no damn weather balloon, either. Who knows? I just know it was weird and I now count myself amongst the many others! who cla im to have seen such strange things in the skies... The funny thing is, I was watching another TV show about UFO's, and they were talking about all of the Gulf Breeze (which is right next to P-Cola) activity from a while back.. and in one of the many pictures they showed that had been taken by a witness, was a picture of pretty much what we saw that day, but they got a shot of all 4 objects together... hhhhmmmm???",2008-06-12T00:00:00,30.462935377358487,-87.26545408805032

I was northeast of Lee Vining and while star gazing with a telescope I noticed a brillant light sitting on the ground appox 3 miles away near the east shore of Mono Lake. It rose straight off the ground and began making slow circles in the sky. Absolutely silent. At one point it passed over a mountain ridge to the east and lit up the entire ridge line so that every detail of the terrain could be seen. I later checked a topo map and this ridge was almost 12 miles away. It was so brillant that I noticed that when it came within 3 miles of me that my body casted a shadow on the ground. I also had a pair of binoculars but the orb of light was just a bluish white plasmic blob. At no time did I ever see the red and green running lights that would readily identify it as an aircraft.  At one point it was joined by a much smaller and dimmer orb of light. Through a pair of binoculars this orb also had no red or green running lights and made no sounds. They circled each other and made severl ""passes"" at each other. I eventually lost track of the smaller object and don't know what happened too it.  After about 2.5 hours the large bright orb of light landed on the ground about three miles from me. I put all my scope gear on the backseat of my car, turned off the lights, and headed slowly down a dirt road directly towards the object. When I got within two miles of it, the dirt road dipped into a dry wash that was about 1/4 of a mile wide, and when I came up the other side of the wash the object was gone. I turned of the engine and stepped into the darkness but the object was gone. The only sound were several upset packs of coyotes howling in the darkness. THEY WERE SPOOKED AND SO WAS I.  I have never reported this incident until now. I have seen a lot of strange lights in the sky after twenty years of star gazing but I could always explain them away. But this one has me baffled. At no time did I ever hear the tell tale noise of an aircraft engine. I am reporting it now because I noticed in your data of sightings that others at the same time camping near Bodie also saw the same thing but I was much closer. There had been several strong series of earthquakes in the area and I often wonder if what I observed were ""earthquake lights"".",2008-06-12T00:00:00,38.035,-118.8256

I was visiting my parents in Greenwood, S.C. over Thanksgiving. The Friday after the holiday, the three of us drove to the nearest city, Greenville, to do some Christmas shopping and to see a movie.  Greenwood is a small city in a rural part of Upstate South Carolina, and the part of Highway 25 we were on is fairly isolated. There are a few homes here and there, but not a lot of development. Consequently, the road is quiet and on a clear night like the one in question, the stars are clearly visible.  Around 10:30 or 11 p.m., I pointed out to my dad that the star on the horizon was particularly clear and beautiful, and he looked and said that while it was very pretty, he thought it was a planet because it looked too bright and large to be a star. My mom said that whatever it was, it looked awfully weird. The closer we got, the stranger it looked. I suggested that it might be a cell phone tower, and my dad disagreed, because the light on a cell phone tower would be red, and this light was white, like a star. That's when I realized that the object had changed positions in the sky. It had moved from the right side of the sky -- the passenger side, based on my position in the car -- to the left side of the sky, and it was definitely getting larger and closer.  It's difficult for me to estimate how many miles we drove until it was directly overhead, but curiosity got the better of us in the little town of Ware Shoals, which is about 20 miles from Greenwood. My dad pulled into the median in front of the Burger King and he and I got out of the car and looked up.  A large triangular craft slowly floated over us. Size in feet is hard for me to estimate and it's been a little while since this happened. I don't want my memory to inflate the measurement, but it was definitely larger than your average low-flying plane. If the sun had been out, it would have cast a shadow that would have covered me, my dad and his SUV. If I had put my hands above my head to blot it out of my vision, I couldn't have done it.  The craft was black and shaped like an equilateral triangle with rounded corners. There were bluish-white lights at each corner and a red light on each of the three sides between the bluish-white lights. It didn't make any sound at all and it floated at an even pace right over the tops of the pine trees. It seemed to be so close to the tops of the trees that I thought it might brush them as it passed over.  I know very little about military aircraft, but I looked up photos of stealth planes later to see if I could find what we saw. It wasn't a B-2, I'm sure of it, because B-2s have a W-shape in the back and what we saw was a solid triangle. It wasn't a Nighthawk either. Both of those planes are too angular. I'm absolutely certain the corners of the triangle were rounded.  When it passed over -- it didn't shoot off at Warp 9 or anything, it just floated over the trees and out of sight -- my dad and I got back in the car. Less than a minute elapsed between the time we stopped the car and the time we got back in. I asked him what we had just seen and he said he didn't know, which surprised me because he's always been interested in military technology. We didn't talk much until we got home. We haven't discussed it since.  Recently, I described the sighting to my boyfriend's father, a retired engineer who developed the engines for the B-2 and the F-117. He said that what I was describing did not match the description of any of our known stealth aircraft.  I am a graduate of Clemson University and I hold a Bachelor of Arts in communication. At the time of the sighting, I worked as a newspaper reporter. I am now employed at an advertising agency as a copywriter. My father holds a Bachelor of Science in business and is a retired executive of a multinational agricultural biotechnology corporation. My mother is a high school graduate and a homemaker.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,34.4295,-82.2164

The date I am reporting is approximate but I know it was between Nov & Dec of 2005.  I was sitting on the couch watching TV with my 2 sons when I heard my dog barking.  I turned around and found her looking out the open front door and at the same time one of my sons was walking over to her to see what she was barking at.  I was getting up myself to see what was going on when I saw my son looking out the door towards where the dog was looking.  At that point he said, ""What is that?""  My second son and I went to the front door and looked out and hovering above several of our neighbors houses and very close to the trees was a huge object and we were staring directly at it!  At first our eyes were directed to 2 red non blinking lights that were opposite of each other and when our eyes started focusing in the dark a little better we could see that there was a very dark (almost matching the night sky dark)cylindar looking object that these lights were a part.  This gave it a cigar looking appearance and as each end looked like burning embers of red & it made no sound whatsover.  My son who first spotted it was scared and ran back into the house.  My other son & I watched it slowly move towards the south of us (towards the Crawfordville area).  After I gathered my thoughts I rushed inside & tried to find my camera but I could not find it so I ran back outside & hopped into my car with my other son as I wanted to try to follow it and get a better view but it just took off & I did not spot it again.   My kids & I have never forgotten that night and have never seen anything like it since.  I am a full time professional women & a busy ""soccer"" mom & to this day I am shaken by what we saw.

I was looking south at same time I woke up a disk shaped object was moving eastward in the sky approx 450 yds high and approx 200 yds away from me its size was approx. 1800 sp ft. disk shaped with a dome with what I thought were windows at the time with bright yellow light coming from the windows  ( I have since determined that the windows were heat vents and the yellow light was a high voltage} It was gold in color and at a 45 degree angle. Now here is what really caught my attention. Out of the bottom (which I could not see) came out 2 different color ( I thought) plasmas one gold or copper and one green around the edges of the plasmas (big blob shape) were looked like roots of trees on both blobs I could see thru each of them they pulsated in opposite resonances for approx 1 minute then stopped the disk shot away at remarkable speed at the 45 degree angle (in the blink of an eye)  Since I was 12 yrs old grew up on a farm I had no idea what that thing was nor did I know what a space ship was, but that has stuck in my mind for years  I have since discovered that the green plasma ( I thought) was in fact the same as happens at the north pole with the lights   a photon or free eletron is traveling and come in contact with a strong magnetic fields flux line and is speeded up and becomes a fast photon or electron and hits an oxygen atom and gives up a green color which is visiable   the copper color I have not figured out yet but must be a secondary electron transfer  since I suppose the ship was charging itself someway.

I distinctly remember looking up and seeing this black triangle with a peculiar orange light source in the center.  It was moving from East to West very slowly towards the pond.  There was still some dusk light coming through a solid overcast layer of thick Cirrostratus or altostratus cloud.  I distinctly remember several of us saying at once, ""What is that""?   It was moving very slowly and made no sound.  An airplane would have made sound.  We watched it pass directly over head and watched it until it went out of sight behind some trees.   Visually it was about the size of a triangular tortilla chip held up at arms length.  The light in the center was a distinct, but not bright orange in color.  It did not illuminate things below it.  It was like looking up into something strange.   It passed directly overhead.    We weren't scared, just real curious.

I was a paper boy for the Fort Worth Star Telegram at the time. I was about 14 years old.  The pre-dawn night was clear and cold with no moon.  Gathering my last newspaper bundle, I noticed the roof of the house across the street, was brighter than all other roof-tops...a kind of glow..almost a fluorecsent white-ish blue aura.  As I was looking at the roof of this house, (I remember thinking perhaps there was a re- placement of new shingles), when the left-hand edge of the roof began to darken.  I began to walk towards the house, and noticed that the house roof-top to the right began to brighten. I arrived in the front lawn of the first house, and could see that the ""glow"" was moving from left to right, very slowly.  There was not a strong definition line to the edge of this ""glow"" as it moved from house #1 to house #2. Now being positioned some few feet away from these houses, I could discern a subtle sort of ""beam"" of light emanating from the roof-tops, and travelling into the sky at about a 70 degree angle.  The ""beam"" reminded me of how a light beam appears when shining a flashlight into the night sky, only larger. As I observed this light moving slowly to cover most of the roof of house #2, it began to fade, (not click-off), rather quickly and was gone.  I stared intently at the star-lit sky for several minutes to see where the light was coming from.  I was not able to see any object, aircraft or otherwise. I do not recall if I perceived the light beam reaching the ground between the houses as it travelled. I reported the sighting/phenomenon to my route manager, as well as my parents and some other folks.  I remember being frustrated that no one seemed to be interested, and my story being received with funny looks and jokes. However, years since witnessing this unexplained sighting, and being college educated, I've yet to receive any plausible, scientific explanation for what occurred. I've travelled past these houses several times over the years, to see...to find...I don't know what.   I do know that I had to report, officially, to someone what I saw and would welcome qualified inquiry and discussion.

July or Aug Evening in 1962-65/ Holden, MA / Light / 60 -120 seconds / White blinking light over Worcester, MA viewed from Holden, MA I was going to bed in my home in Holden, Massachusetts during the summer, around July or August sometime between 1962-1965.  My parents were already in bed and  the lights in the house were out.  I looked out our bathroom window and it was a very quiet summer evening with a clear night sky.  As I looked east, I saw a blinking white light moving in the sky, like a small plane flying at a normal altitude.  However, the light was blinking rapidly, unlike any small plane would have, and I remember that it was absolutely silent.  It looked to be perhaps a mile or so away, and on a very still evening, I was surprised that there was no sound of an engine or plane or anything.  It did not move erratically, but it also did not move as any other aircraft I had seen in that it seemed to have its own path and eventually disappeared in the direction it had come.  Why this experience has remained in my mind all these years is that the next day, or perhaps even the day after that, I noticed in our newspaper, The Worcester Telegram, a very small article in one of the back pages, reporting that an object had been spotted, fitting the description and spotted around the same time period as I had witnessed what I did, and it was reported in the article as an ""unidentified object"" in the sky over ""East Mountain Street"" - which was the direction I was looking from our home on XX Brattle Street, Holden.

Quite frequently I have checked sites looking for reports of this incident, with no results. I was about ten years years old, or so.  It was June or July, when my Dad (ret. Navy/Coast Guard) heard a report on the local radio station (WLNH)that there was a strange event occuring over a local cove. I don't remember which area, but I do recall it not being more than 20 minutes away from the center of town where we lived.  For you see my Dad grabbed his camera, said lets go, and we headed out to the area in question. We were only able to get within a half mile, where we could see a bright orange light over the area through the woods. There was already a crowd, with many vehicles lining the road, which was blocked by police cars, inhibiting furthur encroachment by civilians.  My Dad walked to a group to talk, as we stared at the odd glow that seemed to sink into the surroundings.  The people my Dad spoke to told him we were not allowed to go any closer as the police had made statements concerning possible radiation.  A local doctor my parents knew was there,as he lived in the area, and he told my Dad that he had seen the object in question ""floating down from the night sky, before it took up station hovering just over the water, occasionally emitting an odd green glow from the bottom part, that was nearest the water."" We stayed for hours staring at the glow, with the rest, until the police and fire responders told everyone to leave, as the object was not, and there were concerns for our safety. For weeks after my Dad and I went to the highest point in town, a shopping center heading out of town towards Tilton, to watch for more things floating in out of the sky. My Dad always said he had never seen any articles in the local papers at the time of the incident. People talked about it for ages, but no information could ever be gleaned. After reading of the Guilford Police (around 1964) having not told the public to avoid a panic, I tend to think it was some other reason they were not disclosing. I am still not seeing anything fitting the description of what my Dad and I saw. But it was real, a reliable doctor actually saw it come out of the sky, and there appears to be not record of it anywhere.  I saw the glow that lit up the forest around the cove, if not the actual craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They were classic saucers, but only about 2 feet in diameter, and with what looked like ""antennae"" sprouting from the top center.  They came within about 30-40 feet from my cousin and me, and were also observed by several other family members within about 100 feet.  One was my aunt, about 30 years old at the time and standing about 30 feet behind me - perhaps 60 feet from the craft.  She also saw them clearly as did two other, older cousins.  This occurred on my uncle's farm in northern California roughly 1965-66.  There were a number of animals nearby that reacted violently to the objects - especially one calf that was tethered and unable to run away.  There was also a 3rd UFO nearby - but that one was roughly 30 feet in diameter and was seen only as the smaller ones flew directly away from us and the large craft joined in front of the smaller two.  It came from the side, from several hundred yards away when first noticed, and was seen only in silhouette against the afternoon sky.  The small ones, however, were so close we could see them _very_ well.  They were gray and black, spinning about 30 RPM, exhibited the characteristic ""falling leaf"" motion when descending, and one discharged ""angel hair"" at it's lowest point (about 15-20 feet altitude).  No residue was seen later, and the material seemed to ""dissolve"" in the air while falling.  The objects made no sound.  The small objects hovered in and around some eucalyptus trees about 30 feet from us and perhaps 20 feet in altitude - so we saw them both behind and in front of the trees giving a good visual ""fix"" of their size and position.  They never remained completely still, but made small movements in a jerky way constantly.  After about 3-4 minutes of watching them, they rose vertically to about 100 ft altitude and flew slowly directly away from us slowly ascending.  The larger craft flew in front of the smaller two, then all 3 flew rather slowly out of sight in a straight line, continuously ascending until they flew out of sight.  The total sighting lasted about 5 minutes - which seemed like a _very_ long time under the circumstances.  Unfortunately, no camera was available, for there was plenty of time to take photos.  Other family members remembered a report being made to the Air Force and, perhaps, a small article in the local newspaper, but I do not remember the latter.  No one involved has had another sighting before or since, to the best of my knowledge. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",,39.9259,-122.2835

The A.M. station that my sister and I listened to began to report lights in the skies over Fort Smith.  Of course I immediately ran out into the yard to see for myself.  Huge oak trees largely blocked the view and after a few minutes of surveying the patches of sky overhead I gave up.  The reports continued to pour in and the disc jockey was at a fever pitch. I summoned my dad who listened for while, then I remember him laughing and saying that the station was playing a joke.  At some point he began to take the reports somewhat seriously and we climbed into his ’46 Plymouth and drove to a remote area known as Wild Cat Mountain Lake. It was wide open and afforded as much of a horizon-to-horizon view as anywhere in the Fort Smith area.  We sat on the hood for a long time until I bored and climbed back in the car.  Almost immediately I heard my dad shout something and scampering back out found him pointing at two white lights moving slowly across the sky from east to west.  They weren’t very bright and if they had not have been moving, would have easily blended in with the stars.  They were traveling side by side, about two fingers apart at arm’s length.   When they were almost directly overhead they suddenly made opposite 90-degree turns and quickly accelerated out of sight.  Shortly after, a solitary light, much brighter, tracked across the sky at a tremendous rate of speed.  It took probably less than 15 seconds to traverse the sky from the east to the west horizon.  We sped back home to find several of our neighbors in lawn chairs – in the street!  The next three to four hours we watched an amazing display.  As time went on the lights came in at lower altitudes and glowed the spectrum from white to orange, with the intensity (brightness) increasing as they became more orange. As I recall, they would glow brightest when hovering. At their closest and brightest, they were perhaps one-third the size of a full moon.  I can’t estimate the! altitud e, but at one point I did contemplate fetching my BB gun and taking a pot shot.  So, bad idea aside they did come in very low. They would fly in formations of two or three, stop suddenly, hover, make impossible turns, and accelerate out of sight in seconds.  It was almost as though it were choreographed for the benefit of the crowd below. At one point when a single object hovered directly overhead, I was able to observe it at length through a powerful pair of binoculars offered by a neighbor.  It was more or less triangular shaped, not sharply, but more like a guitar pick.  I’ve heard descriptions of spheres and chevrons being seen that night, but that was not what I was looking at.  If those other accounts are accurate then there was either more than one type of object or the shape was not static. This thing appeared to glow from within, like an old Christmas tree light bulb and there was some sort of structure resembling a grid or a checkerboard on the underside.  At least one television station and a radio station were broadcasting live from the parking lot of the Coca-Cola bottling plant, less than a mile west of the Fort Smith airport which shares a common runway with the 188th Fighter Wing, known at the time as the 188th Tactical Reconnaissance Group.  Both the airport and the air guard are in virtual line of sight of the parking lot and it was thought curious that no jets were scrambled during that evening, more so as antidotal evidence surfaced in the following days that the objects had been painted on radar.  Someone had a transistor radio out on the street that night and we could hear the crowd reacting on the live broadcast as the objects “performed” so we could be certain that we were seeing the same objects as those at the bottling plant parking lot, which was approximately 2 miles from our location.  The next morning the Southwest Times Record ran a front-page story on the sightings, complete with a low-resolution jerky black and white time exposure that to this day still ranks as the worst! UFO pho to I’ve ever seen.  Needless to say, the town and the media were abuzz. A couple of days later the Air Force out of Little Rock released a statement, to the amusement of those who had not seen the objects, explaining away the entire incident as swamp gas.  There are two things I can say with certainty about the objects I witnessed:  1) They were solid objects, not gaseous and 2) They were controlled (flying in formation, etc).   The speed and maneuverability that these objects soundlessly displayed, is still exponentially greater than any technology even today, almost 40 years later.  I would love to hear from others that were witness to the phenomenon that night in 1967.  My dad, the neighbor with the binoculars and I’m sure many others are no longer with us.  Let’s not let this story die as well.  I'm guessing at the date based upon other reports, so if you are certain of the exact date please post.
