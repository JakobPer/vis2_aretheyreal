To the south (looking towards Phoenix, Arizona) I noticed three lights equally separated in a triangular shape, hovering just above a local mountain range.  I quickly recognized these lights as resembling the largely talked about Phoenix Lights above Phoenix, Arizona spotted 10 years ago on March 13, 1997. I quickly pointed them out to my friend (who is a very well-respected woman who works in one of the local school districts) who was driving the car and she agreed that these lights were very out of the ordinary. I watched the lights start to quickly spread apart, one orb heading east, one heading west, and one heading north. My view was then disrupted by a hill on the side of the road for about 5-10 seconds. When we finally passed by the hill, the three orbs had disappeared into the night sky leaving me in a state of awe.

A few minutes later there was a red and white blinking light coming towards Laconia, crossing over Lake Winnisquam.  It looked like a plane, but then the blinking lights appeared to be more than two at a time and jumping around. I got my binoculars and my twelve year old son came out with his new mini-camcorder. He set up to view the plane and see if it could record in the dark. I looked through the binoculars and saw red and white blinking lights flying low over the lake.  My son was excitedly trying to get my attention because what he could see on the little video screen was several colored lights on one object, randomly blinking.  He taped 28 seconds as the silent object got closer and flew to the right of us and out of our sight over Laconia. We downloaded the clip to the computer and were able to view it on a larger screen then break it down to see thirty frames per second. Each frame had a different configuration of lights. One frame had a single red light, the next showed several lights including yellow, blue, purple, pink, red, white and green. When played at real time, it was impossible for our eyes to keep up with the colors or speed. When slowed down, the clip  shows a disk shaped craft with many blinking lights circling the outer edge. I noticed that when I looked with and without the binoculars, I only saw red and white lights. The camera lenses were able to capture the colors humans can't see as the lights blinked at such rapid speeds.

It was around 5:30pm and the sky was clear and bright. As me and my son(13)was coming out of the Wal-Mart in Salem Virginia i looked up in the ski to the far south.  And I then told my son to look at that bright ""light"" in the sky.  We didn't see a shape but it look like one ""headlight"" in the sky traveling backwards.   At first this ""light"" wasn't moving fast.  It actually look like it was just sitting still. Then we looked up a little higher and we saw three jets at first they look like they was just going across but then they starting racing towards the ""light"".  At first I thought they were regular plane but they were too high and moving fast. Then the light"" starting moving south.   As the jets got closer to the ""light"" it stated to move faster.  So I told my son to get in the car because it's going in the direction we are going.  I could barely keep my eyes on the road because i was too busy looking up ""accident waiting to happen"".   As we travel south on 460 to the Elliston area the light started to slight disapear (it look like it was now some where past blacksburg area) then from the southeast we saw another jet or miltary plane moving fast in the same direction as the other 3 jets and the ""Light"".  After that i couldn't see any more because of the mountains.   Whatever it was the i know the military was going after.   If i saw that ""Light' i know others had to see it as well.   I am Christain and i believe in GOD and i don't believe in UFO or anything like that.  But after seeing what me and my son saw today make me think other wise.

As it came nearer i saw a wide trail of soft misty white light trail behind it.   I went in to my home quickly and obtained my binoculars and using them saw a huge black triangular craft with a small white light on each corner glowing with a large red light in the centre pulsating.   As it flew overhead i suddenly realised there was absolutely no sound and it flew by as if gliding at a very low speed.I believe it was about two thousand feet high and it was huge blocking out groups of stars as it passed. I noticed as it flew away the rear edge seemed to give off a strange moving glow that really defies description. This glow appeared to create the light trail behind. The light trail was more like a whispy mist effect like you see when the suns rays penetrate trees in a forest. This light trail was almost ghostly.  The dark red light seemed to shimmer like a mirage in the desert it was unlike any light effect i have ever seen.  I noted as it flew by there was no sound at all and although huge in size it appeared very flat like a board.  I felt mesmerised looking at it amazed by its size and the complete absence of any sound. My father was in the Air Force for many years and i have lived near air bases my entire life.

I saw what I thought at first, a large white landing light approach from the south, near the town of Millersville. I estimate it was about 5 miles to my south when first viewed.  My first thought was this aircraft was unusually low, as the local airport is approx. 8 miles to my north.  The white light was moving slowly about 1000’ AGL and had no accompanying red or white upper or lower strobes, had a bright warm white glow; and no sound.  After watching the large white light continue north towards me for approx. 10 seconds, I detected some faint green lights on the upper portion of the object.  At this point, the light slowed and moved SIDEWAYS to the west.  The white light continued facing to the north during the initial move.  The object was partially blocked from my view by a group of pine trees as it headed west.  After the object came back into full view it changed into a group of three inverted V’s, forming a pyramid/triangle shape.  It continued west for approx. five miles.  The inverted V’s were a mix of pale green and bright red lighting, similar to faint LED’s, not a bright aircraft position or strobe light. As the object made the turn from north to west, I could hear a deep sound similar to air rushing through turbines.  That was the only time I heard any sound from the object. The object again turned north towards a tall cell tower with bright white strobe on top, near the town of Mountville.  It flew past the cell tower and it’s lighting on the three inverted V’s changed to a bright pulsing red. It appeared the pulsing on the object picked up the strobe flash interval on the cell tower. The object continued to the north-northwest in the (3) inverted V shape and passed behind some distant buildings and out of my sight. Disclaimer:  I am a Military pilot (fulltime) and am familiar with aircraft lighting and flight paths.  I’ve lived at my present location for over 15 years and am familiar with the day to day flight paths of commuter aircraft and the occasional corporate or medevac helo over my location and this sighting was definitely not normal and ""shook me up"" to the point I felt it necessary to file a report.    I considered calling the local ATC Approach control after the sighting to see if any pilots had reported similar sightings but my wife talked my out of it.",2008-03-31T00:00:00,40.03326710353867,-76.30302319790302

My husband half-jokingly said it could be one of those military aircrafts but what would they be doing flying over a small town like this?

This time I was not alone as my husband also witness the lights.  The lights appear very large but when we happen to look at them, the lights began to turnoff almost immediately.   When the lights turned off we were unable to see anything in the night sky.  So we looked to the west of US 60 and we saw the same lights hovering over what appeared to be possibly 6 to 8 miles east of US60.  The lights again disappeared very quickly.  We don't know if this was the same object we had seen only a few seconds to the right of us ( west of US60) or if this was another one.  Anyway the lights disappeared and we could no longer see anything in the sky.  I told my husband that was similiar to what I had witness a few months ago and that i then saw jets flying after or searching for something only a couple of minuets later.   Sure enough when we got home to our drive way, here comes a couple of jets flying as if in pursuit.  The same as the last incident they don't seem to find what they are looking for.  My suspicion is that these two incidents i have witness is that the object is still in the sky, just hovering in the same spot without the lights on.  I don't know, but what ever it is the object by the distance of each light appears to be as large as a football field in length and that this is the second time I have witness these lights as I am also sure that there has to be more people who must have seen these same lights as we are not the only ones traveling on US 60 on these two nights that this object has appeared in the sky and they are very large.  As a matter of fact I think that a couple days after the october sighting the local news had reported other people sighting lights in Scottsdale, AZ.   It would be interesting to see if reports are made to local news after this report is filed from me. Makes me wonder if this is an actual UFO sighting or military excercises of sorts, since the sightings are not far from Luke Air force Base and an Auxilary base approximatley 7 miles from my house.  The only ? I have is that the jets do not appear to be coming to going to any of these bases, rather appear to be coming from California or Nevada is my guess from the direction i saw them chasing the or pursing the object. Reported by rc from ((numbers deleted))  phnx.qwest.net ((numbers deleted)) on Monday, October 09, 2006 at 3:27AM :  On 10-4-06 driving home from work on US 60 towards Wickenburg around 7:30pm a light got my attention to towards the lake pleasant mountains. At first glimpse I thought it was a fire, but then realized that it was object with it red lights were hovering over the chrysler proving grounds as if in a still position. I could only see a C shape from the angle I was looking at it. It had red lights around the bottom and all i can say is that from seeing the lights and the C shape, my guess is that what I was seeing was round and very large. I was about 10 miles away. The lights turned off one by one very fast and then the i could see no object or anything as it had disappeared?? I could not longer see anything there. As I turned off to go home and got off the car i noticed 2 airforce jets flying over which is not unusual as we live not far from LAFB and LAF auxillary. What caught my attention is that the plans where were turned out to be at least five to seven of them were not flying in any formation as they normally do and were flying extremly faster than what we normally see them out here. They scattered going east as if they were in pursuit. I then suspected that what I had seen is what they might be after, but they were heading the wrong direction. Within a few minuets they turned back around and continued flying around for several hours as if searching for something???? I went to bed, but my daughter stayed up watching and said they searched til 3:00 am. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I would guess the object was quite large, quite high up - 2000 feet? - could not really tell - was large ... object was greyish where the moon was illuminating it - definitely darker than the surrounding sky, had many bright lights on bottom in rings - random big square yellowish lights - and had a few red lights and other smaller white lights sprinkled over the surface randomly. could not see the top of it from my angle. no lights blinked. object did not spin, windows were wide open last night and object made no noise. moved very slowly eastward. watched it for about 5 to 10 seconds but seemed longer. i was really upset at what i saw .. i remember saying WTF out loud and went to another window on the other side of the bedroom for a better look as tree blocking my view from first window i viewed it from but object did not reappear on other side ... i continued to look for a few more minutes but saw nothing ... my dog stopped barking after i lost sight of the object and i went back to bed. looked at the clock and time was exactly 12:54 am so i saw something at 12:52-53. really upset me to see this, have no idea what it was and i had a lot of trouble going back to sleep. really tired today. searched the internet today to see if anyone else saw something last night and found this site to leave this message.  the object was not a plane - too low for that - shape was all wrong. shaped like a child's top but did not spin .. had a lot of lights on it. it was huge. i could see this really well last night because of the full moon. image is imprinted in my mind and i can't forget it. i am hoping someone on the other side of the river saw it too last night so i know i am not losing my mind!

This is a current interest of our homeowners association which the Board of Director is now considering for our community.  We live on a 28 acre lake so some members of the Board of Directors were thinking about placing a large colorful fountain in the middle of the lake for esthetics. To support this project, I took my Canon 20D, a high quality 8-megapixel digital camera, and set it up on a tripod at our community pavilion using a ISO or light sensitivity rating of 1600 for night time photography. My photo shoot went well.  I probably spent about 20 minutes getting all the photos I thought I needed. I was not aware of anything in the background night sky as I took my time lapse photos. I was only interested in getting good photos with proper focus and good exposure. It was not until I returned home, took a nap and woke up again about 11:00 PM that I decided to download the digital images from my camera to my computer. As I was going through these images I noticed a fuzzy spot near one of two radio broadcast towers that have powerful strobe lights. The two towers are located about 9/10ths of a mile east southeast of the location where I took the pictures you'll see below. When I zoomed in on the photo of the radio tower to the left in the photos below I could see that my camera had captured an image of something I'd not been aware of at all when I was taking these photos. While I was taking the digital images I noticed there were some aircraft quickly passing overhead but didn't think much of it except to curse a bit because of the visual interference. However, I knew I could easily eliminate these streaks left by airplanes by using my graphics software. Below you can see one such aircraft that came into view while I was shooting my photos. It left a visible trai! l in my time lapse photography.  All of my photos, except one or two, were shot using time lapse photography. I used a 5 second exposure time, set the ISO to 1600, the F-stop was set at 5.6 with manual focus set at 55 millimeters. So any moving object in my field of view would have presented a trail, as you see below, caused by the time lapse photography. The UFO I later spotted in my imagery did not move. It was fixed in place as you'll see below.  A plane moves across the night sky on one of my first images of the night sky  (Photo)  Below at the arrow is where you see the movement of that plane during my 5 second exposure. The camera is facing southeast. You can see the vertical ground-up illumination of the background sky lighting.  This image was depixelated to enhance the ringed view of the city background lighting effect. I saw this plane in my viewfinder as I was taking the photo. So this plane was very obvious because the lights on the aircraft were somewhat bright. The azimuth of the aircraft heading was about 100 degrees or ESE. aircraft in flight  (Photo)   At 8:05:40 PM on Feb. 24, 2007 something quite mysterious and unexplained appeared in a series of digital images I took which you'll see below. An unknown object or UFO  appeared in my images after I came home to view them on my computer. When I describe this as a UFO sighting I certainly don't mean an alien spacecraft. I don't even know if this object was flying.  In the context of UFO I mean that I haven't yet figured out for certain what this particular UFO phenomenon might possibly be. One assumes that the object which shows up in my digital imagery must be some type of unknown aircraft or perhaps some type of light generated phenomenon in need of an explanation.  I've conducted studies of the physical properties of ""light ducting"" phenomena which occurs in atmospheric layers and also have considerable field experience in atmospheric physics.  I've even written scientific papers on super refractivity and the UFO phenomenon. I spent a two year stint working on a government program to examine UFO sightings reported by foreign governments who sought to understand their own UFO sightings which they reported to the U.S. government. In nearly all cases our government scientists and astronomers could easily attribute a reason for nearly all of these sightings reported by foreign governments.  After considerable thought and research they most often were explained as falling space debris, likely meteors, astronomical sightings of stars or planets or other known celestial phenomenon.  Occasionally these UFO sightings are of earthly origin such as migrating flocks of birds and even large swarms of insects that catch light reflected from earth. Some sightings of insect migration even present radar returns on occasion. So I am no stranger to the fascinating subject of UFO's.   What I've been able to tell from my initial examination of my UFO photos of February 24, 2007 --- that you'll see below --- is that the unidentified object captured with my digital camera remained aloft in my field of view from 20:05:40 PM until the last image I captured of it which was 20:15:52 PM. I'm assuming it may have been present beyond 20:15:52 PM but I just don't have the physical evidence. I do know for certain that it was not in view prior to 8:02:02 PM because I have imagery of the exact same area and nothing was present in my imagery. The period in which my camera imaged the UFO was over a 10 minute period of time in a very small area of the sky. Airplanes quickly transit the sky as you see in the first photo above. They are very easy to distinguish. However, I was taking time lapse photography and the UFO in view was almost motionless during that 5 second interval the images were made with my Canon 20D. That long dwell time in the sky in a near motionless presence is very strange indeed.......unless the object was hovering or was a very far away. The UFO did slowly move in relation to the tree tops below but this movement was less than 10 degrees as it remained fixed about 4 or 5 degrees above the horizon. This was right above the pine tree tops at a distance away of 1,000 feet. All the time I was taking photos I was unaware of this object in the dark sky. It was almost pitch black sky at 8:00 PM and the moon was not out. Only the small amount of illumination from house lights and street lamps was available. So my vision was not nearly as good as you see in these photos which were taken with a $1,500 digital camera. I used an ISO setting of 1600 and a time exposure of 5 seconds which allowed my digital camera to see what I did not take notice of. The resulting images with a high ISO can literally turn night into day. However, I was not after that effect. I only wanted to capture realistic evening photos so I later could superimpose a fountain onto the lake and then be able to present the im! age to o ur homeowners association Board of Directors. Again, it was only hours after I took these photos that I realized there was something unusual on the digital images that I couldn't explain. Not only did I see in the images a suspected UFO, but I also saw a very large globe appear in the sky which you'll see in one of the photos below. This is a phenomenon that I do not attempt to explain except to suggest it may have been some sort of visual artifact within the camera. However, there is this perfectly round globe inside of which is the UFO as observed in several of the photographs. Again, I reiterate that I was not able to see these strange things while I was taking these images. I am able to slight enhance the presence of the light colored globe but have only done so in one image you see below. This globe-like halo effect is the most mysterious thing I see in any of these photos. I am mystified by its unique appearance. I have the original 8 megapixel images on my computer but to make the images you see below I have depixelated them which imperceptibly degrades the quality of the images.  Any seasoned photographer, even an amateur photographer understands that sometimes there are artifacts of light that get into their camera lenses and bounce around.  This sometimes produces visual effects that obviously were not seen with the naked eye when the photo was taken. Often these artifacts are passed off as real ghosts by true believers. I'm sure there are UFO's reported that are nothing more than extraneous refractions of light that get into the camera and somehow distort images. However, in this case I have 8 photos of the UFO object and all were imaged at high resolution using an 8 megapixel camera. I have all these images in their original native format.  The first image I have of this UFO was taken at 8:02:48 PM. The image below shows the UFO with four white lights and what appears to be red lights interspersed between the white lights. The white dot below the object is either a star or perhaps a bad pixel. This UFO object is very large in the sky but it's really not that bright, certainly not as bright as any of the aircraft I saw flying last night. Aircraft are usually seen as small points of moving light and the aircraft engine noise is sometimes faintly discernable. When using time lapse imagery these aircraft always move along a ray trace on a photograph as you saw above. The unidentified object below, which I never observed visually with my own eyes, was really quite wide. As you see I am a careful not to say flying because I don't know if it was flying and, in fact, I suspect it was NOT flying because it remained somewhat stationary in the same approximate location in the sky for over 10 minutes.. So I use the term UFO very loosely to suggest the object simply remains unidentified, at least by me. I have measured the angular width of the UFO and determined that it is 1/4 or ) 0.25 degrees (or 15 minutes) in width. For reference purposes the width of the sun and moon are both 0.5 degrees. So the object below would be just 1/2 the width of the sun or moon. Using simple trigonometry it now would is possible to determine what the true width of the UFO would be for any given distance. See the on-line trig calculator at http://www.carbidedepot.com/formulas-trigright.asp . If the UFO was exactly one mile away its width would be 23 feet. If the UFO was 5 miles away the width would be 115 feet. At 10 miles away the width would be 230 feet. At 15 miles away 345 feet. And lastly, at 30 miles distant the width would be about 690 feet which is typical for many cruise ships. Sailing 30 miles off the coast of Florida is typical for these cruise ships.   The home you see in the photo below is directly across the lake and is exactly 1,010 feet away from where the camera took these digital images. Below you see the first appearance of the UFO  (Photo)   The next photo was taken a full minute and 20 seconds later at 20:06:00 PM. THe UFO seems to have slightly repositioned itself with respect to the bright star which now is perfectly in line with the object. The lateral movement is about 2 to 3 degrees to the right when compared to the photo above  (Photo)  Same photo as the image above. Notice that there are two radio broadcast towers in the background.   The taller radio tower you see in the image above is located along an azimuth of 126.5 degrees (ESE) with ref. to True North and with respect to the camera. The tower is 0.875 miles or 4,625 feet away. It's calculated height is 438 ft. high. Ground elevation is 26 ft. above mean sea level. North is up in the photo map. The tallest of the two FM radio broadcast towers is located at 28-02-50.50 North latitude and 80-40-31.69 West longitude. It has two strobe lights.  The shorter FM broadcast tower with only one strobe light is 241 ft. high and is located at 28-02-55.08 North latitude and 80-40-32.54 West longitude. It is located 0.82 miles or 4,311 feet from the camera. The azimuth from the camera to the tallest tower with two strobe lights is 132.2 degrees (w/ref. to magnetic north) or 126.5 degree w/ref. to true North. This corrected azimuth applies the year 2007 correction for magnetic declination of 5 deg. 44 min. West for this particular location. The shorter radio tower lies along a magnetic north compass azimuth of 128.5 degrees which also is corrected to 122.75 degrees w/ref. to true North. This means there is 3.75 degrees of angular separation between the two FM radio towers as observed at the point the camera took the photos.    The terminus of the white line is the radio tower with two strobe lights located 0.9 miles away from the camera. (Photo)   Below is a satellite view of the tallest broadcast tower you see with two strobe lights as noted in the images above and below.The measured shadow length of the tower is 386 feet. I suspect that with the sun angle observed that the shadow approximates the actual height of the radio tower. However, when I checked with the FCC licensing for this tower I saw that they only permitted the licensee to have a 100-ft height tower. It therefore may be an illegal height.  (Photo)  The image below was taken at 8:06:22 PM or about 22 seconds after the one immediately above. The object remained at the same range or distance. I simply zoomed in or blew up the size of the image differently in both the images above and below. The angular width of the UFO remains at 0.25 degrees in width.  As you can see in this next photo the UFO is really quite bright in the night sky so it surprises me that I didn't take notice of it when I originally was shooting these images. But the fact was my wife was cooking dinner for me so I wanted to hurry along and get this photo shoot done and return home. Never in my wildest imagination did I think my images would show the presence of a UFO in view.   The next image you see was taken at 20:14:56 PM EST.  During the post processing phase I digitally zoomed in on the object to see the individual pixels that clearly show that there are four distinct white lights with what appears to be red lights in between the white lights. The lights look to be equidistant to each other. The object is angled at about 45 degrees in this image. I should note that lights transmitted within atmospheric ducts or between thermal layers of air as well as desert mirages often become angled, distorted, inverted or even twisted. In this blow-up it appears that the object is colored both red and green. There definitely are pixels in the image that recorded red and a few also were recorded as green.   This appears to be the best image I got of the UFO. To the right is the tall radio tower with the two strobe lights.The UFO is just below the arrow. Using a precision Suunto clinometer I accurately measured the height of the tallest tower to have an elevation angle of 5.4 degrees above the horizon. The angle above the horizon for the shorter tower is 3.2 degrees above the horizon.  The azimuth of the UFO is 119.95 degrees w/ref. to true north and the elevation angle is 5.5 degrees.   The next photo was taken at 8:15:07 PM. It is the brightest image of this UFO I imaged on Saturday night, Feb. 24th. You can see in the image below that the UFO appears to have been rotated on its axis. Now we see only three white lights.  We also see a red light on the left side suggesting this rotation.   Azimuth of the UFO is now at 120.875 degrees w/ref. to true north  Now something changes in the angle of the object with respect to my camera view of it. The time of this image is 8:15:18 PM, or 9 seconds after the image above was taken.  (Photo)  Below is the full view of the object seen just above. The UFO is seen at an azimuth 121.75 degrees w/ref. to true North. Because the sight picture has changed so much it suggests that this is an optical aberration and not some kind of aircraft or alien spaceship.  (Photo)   Now we quickly see an entirely different view of this object. This image was taken at 20:15:38 PM or some 20 seconds after the image seen immediately above. We now see 8 white lights and perhaps no red lights. Because of the double rows of lights I am inclined to think this is an artifact of light refraction. The image actually seems to have been split and set in parallel rows with four other lights.   In the photos that were taken between 8:14:56 PM and 8:15:52 PM there is the presence of a very strange light globe in the imagery contained in five frames. You cannot discern the angle of illumination for the globe in the photo immediately below, but you can see it in the photo that follows the one below. The angle of light illumination is not vertical as one might expect if the globe was the result of city light illumination. This aspect of the photo is very puzzling. The UFO is inside the light colored globe just above the radio tower strobe light. I was not aware of this light colored globe in the night sky when I was taking these photos. It is very discrete and only discernable with time lapse photography. It was much later after I looked at the digital images that the globe was first visible to me. The azimuth to the UFO is about 122 degrees (ref. true North)  The photo below is greatly depixelated to show the angle of illumination on the mysterious globe in the background. This is the last image I took of the UFO at 8:15:52 PM. It may have lingered for a while longer but I was never aware of its presence, otherwise I would have taken dozens of images of it in rapid succession using 5 second times lapse photography. In this image the previous parallel lines of four lights each now seems to be bent at the near end. MY THEORY ON WHAT THIS EVENT WAS:  So what do I think these strange lights in the night sky were? From my scientific field experience in the South China Sea a quarter century ago, I believe the most likely explanation for this sighting was atmospheric ducting phenomena. This occurs under somewhat unusual but not rare circumstances called temperature inversions. What my camera imaged is possibly a light source that was coupled into an atmospheric duct or a laminar flow of warm air inverted above cooler surface air creating a low level ducting channel. This type of duct permits light and even radio signals to be transmitted great distances without any appreciable loss of energy. When I draw a straight line from my observation point where the images were taken along the 121 degree azimuth of the UFO sighting, the line travels towards the Bahamas. In fact it passes close to Grand Bahama Island where Freeport is located. Another possibility is that this sighting of strange lights was possibly a cruise ship at sea about 30 miles from Melbourne, FL. Some of these ships are very tall and could serve as the light source for the UFO sighting. These ships also are very well lit at night. The map below shows various cruise line routes to the Bahamas and the Caribbean Islands. They depart for these cruses from Port Canaveral located 40 miles north of Melbourne and head south not far off the coast for some distance. (Google satgellite view of eastern Florida)   Why was I able to photograph this phenomenon?   All I can conjecture is that for some reason the unexplained light suddenly decoupled from its light channel about where I was located when I took the images.  Perhaps the decoupling out of the atmospheric duct occurred overland and it was simply fortuitous that I was in the right location at exactly the right moment in time.  There's no doubt that my camera recorded something very, very curious. However, my inclination is to seek a rational understanding and not speculate that extraterrestrials came visiting on February 24, 2007. I'll just have to guess that this light show I observed in my imagery was nothing more that light passing over the Atlantic ocean which warmed the air.  The light was then sandwiched by a cold boundary layer of air from land.  This caused a condition of super refractivity resulting in the unusual sighting of strange lights. Below you see a ray trace in red which is the azimuth along which I first sighted the UFO. At the bottom left corner of the graphic below you see a scale which depicts distance in miles. So 50 miles is about an inch on this graphic.",2007-03-08T00:00:00,,

It was flying at a slow speed as we got closer and were directly under it we could see it actually had two additional bright lights on its belly.  All five lights were round, the same color and were steadily lit.  The aircraft was black and triangular.  It was a clear night. We didn't hear any sound come from the aircraft but of course our windows were up.  The reason I’m reporting this is because I’ve seen planes fly by in the nighttime sky and they usually have green and red blinking lights.  This aircraft did not.  It seemed to be moving Northeast.   We were so amazed that I pulled into a parking lot, but when we looked back it had disappeared.  How can an aircraft with such bright lights and flying at such a low altitude disappear so suddenly?

In this relatively short time I've experienced paranormal phenomena captured on film and EVP, AND most recently, my first UFO experience!   Westlock is a small town approx. one hour north of Edmonton, Alberta and the area in which I live is about seven miles from the townsite, free of any artificial light that can hinder night-sky observation. This recent episode actually constitutes my second ""sighting"" of this nature, which occured Oct. 3 2006.  At the time, I was the only one who witnessed the event and at the time wasn't certain if it warranted a report.)   Back to this January event: I had gone to sleep that evening at about 10 p.m. and woke up at 3 a.m. for no particular reason.  But I was compelled to look outside - something I do almost compulsively now whenever the sky is clear at night. In the southeast sky, above the treetops (mature black spruce about 20 feet in height) was what looked like a very bright star bouncing (or dancing) around - akin to a balloon or bag that gets caught in the wind and remains aloft. I know what satellites look like, and planets and plane lights, etc.  This wasn't it - in fact, at the time, it was almost like I knew intrinsically that this was something otherworldly, a feeling I have no explanation for. I watched it for about 30 seconds before bounding upstairs and waking my mom. I had witnessed practically the exact same ""star-like"" performance on Oct. 3 and after telling my mother about it,  she wanted to be informed if it happened again, no matter the time. After she bounded out of bed, we both peered out of the 2nd story window and  watched this ""star"" move in circles and up and down, and it continued to do these acrobatics for a full half hour. Afterwords, it just seem to fade into the night sky. I haven't seen it since, but about a week ago I heard what sounded like a ""whirly-gig"" coming from the direction of the treetops (something a kid would put on their bike or you see in gardens - sounds like the plastic blades of a wind toy.)   It was too dark to confirm what the source was.  For a moment I thought it might be something caught in the trees or a weird wind weather system, but after careful analysis, I've excluded those possibilities. Also, about a week after our sighting, the military have started to do training flights with low-level helicopters in the area and I watched one zoom over our farm about 50 feet from the ground.  This can't be a coincidence, can it?   If anyone in my area knows anything or has seen anything, please report on this site (I don't have email at this point!)

I have witnessed shooting stars, comets, aircraft, hot air balloons, and even the occasional faint satellite, and this was none of those. The size was similar to that of a dime held at arms length. My immediate thoughts were that there had been some sort of disaster with the shuttle or space station. My daughter said maybe a plane on fire, but we figured a plane would not keep speed and altitude if it were burning (plus there were no other lights). I know that the confirmation of 2 11-year-old girls may not hold much weight, but we all saw something very different tonight.",2007-08-14T00:00:00,42.8446,-82.8

I had backed the boat into his garage so we would have some light to work by.  At approximately 2200 hours, my father said ""What's that up in the sky?""  I looked out the open garage door, toward the northwest, to see a string of 6-8 ""orange flame"" colored lights traveling in a north easterly direction across the sky.  They were evenly spaced approximately 20-30 feet apart.  I stepped out of the garage and walked out into the gravel driveway in an attempt to get a better look.  I estimate that lights were between 300-500 feet from the ground traveling between 5-10 mph.  It appeared that the lights were attached to ""something"" as they moved in a linear direction with absolutely no change in speed, direction, or elevation.  My initial impression was that a small airplane was towing a rope with lit torches attached, through the night sky.  That thought quickly faded as there was absolutely no airplane related sounds what-so-ever during the entire time of the sighting.  In fact, everything was quiet.  I made a conscious effort to try and identify the shape or sort of object these lights were attached to without any success.  No sort of craft was visible or heard at all either between or near the lights.  After approximately 1-2 minutes, the lead light began to fade and went out.  My impression is that it looked exactly as if a torch had simply burned itself out.  The remainder of the lights dimmed and appeared to burn out, 1 by 1, from front to back in a similar fashion.  When all the lights went out, we returned to working on the boat.  Neither of us could explain what we had just seen.  A short time later, as we were talking about the event, we could smell a strong odor of gun powder; very similar to the odors after a 4th of July fireworks display.

We suddenly saw an array of about 10-15 lights, appearing sequentially on the southern horizon. They were in groups of one to five, and were traveling along the same trajectory from south to north at a constant velocity—about the speed of a small plane. It was difficult to assess their size or altitude, but they appeared to be fairly large and spherical, with a single light in each shape. The lights appeared to be glowing, similar to waxing and waning yellow-colored flames. They were much larger in appearance than any meteors, satellites, or space shuttles we have ever seen in the past.

I haven’t gone out in almost a year to absorb the beauty of the night sky, but today was the day that I will never forget, and will never regret for doing so.  As I stepped out into my backyard, my eyes were trying to adjust from the computer that I was staring at for sometime.  I lay on the concrete floor and relaxed to enjoy the night sky.  I live in a city where lights do obscure most of the sky when one stares out to the distance from ones zenith.   I am a college student at my local community college and have taken astronomy and other sciences to give me the ability, to some degree, to determine what has validity and what doesn’t.  I routinely have helicopters and airplanes fly over my house, but what I saw this night was not such. As I lay for about 5 minutes, the stars in the night sky became much clearer.  I was telling myself how I must get away from technology, such as the internet and T.V. for starters.  I told myself that I need to go out on a regular basis and take in my surroundings, and as I finished that thought, a light came from ""out of the sky"" and into my view. It moved swiftly and at a very steady pace. I was waiting to see some pulsating lights and to hear some sounds to determine if it was a plane, jet, or anything that I can relate it to, but it never came. As I boggled to determine what it was, I noticed that it seemed as if the lights where joined. As I finished that thought, it split up into three different lights. The light (then lights) were moving in a southeast to northeast direction. When the lights broke off from each other, the middle one did not stay in formation, and pulled closer to the one left of it. 	The perimeter of my backyard has trees, and when it reached that area, I was still capable of seeing it very well. Then a fourth light came out of ""nowhere"" and started following it as well. The middle one kept on moving back in forth from the center of the formation towards the light left to it. The lights kept its speed and that’s when I told myself that I still have time to get my fourteen-year-old brother to enjoy this fascinating and boggling experience. I say boggle because when describing it to someone else, that is all that they would be capable of comprehending. Truly I was not boggled but sure that there are other people like us out their, with fascinating advancements in their civilizations. As my brother hurried towards the backyard, his eyes were not adjusted to see what I was seeing. I felt alone in enjoying this, but none the less it was beautiful. As my brother was out in the backyard with me, only three were remaining heading towards the northeast sky, and eventually the city lights obscured it from total sight. 	The lights were like that of a medium star that you would see in the night sky, but it did not pulsate or give off rays, (as if a kid were to draw the sun where rays are being placed around the sun) such as the stars exhibit at night. The light was oval shaped but not totally, it seemed like a solid light but not emitting light out wards (it’s as if the energy of the light was contained in its structure), and it was definitely thousands of feet up in the sky.  I know that we have bad depth perception when estimating the distance in the sky at night, but I have looked at objects fly over my house at night, so I have some confidence in my statement. Also the estimation has to be drawn by how big the object was, so if I were to guess the size, just one of the lights that split up had to be bigger than a conventional airplane. Their were no other planes or conventional objects in the area. It did not move in a straight line in the southeast and northwest direction, but swiftly and naturally. The main word is that it was so natural the way they moved. My brother went on playing his video games, but I am changed forever. I have studied and researched ""UFO’s"" all my life, with the disclosure project research and other sources under my belt. 	If I were to tell someone my background in what I know about""UFO’s,"" I think it would add less creditability to me, but since I know so much about it, subjectively I have a better chance at determining what I saw. I ask myself, ""Why am I so special to have these lights tell me to come out and see them move so naturally and beautifully?""  They wanted me to see them, they wanted me to do what I have been meaning to do, and that is to go back outside, and meditate, and get away from technology like I have before. This sighting was meant to be personal. I don’t mean to be so dramatic but this is my TRUTH, my reality, my life, my experience and overall this is FACT. To sum up what I learned tonight, it is this message that they wanted me to give. ""They are here, and they are almost ready."" 	I called coast to coast but it rang endlessly and maybe it was because it is a Saturday, so I remembered the ufo center website and called them, but I only left a message.  I immediately started writing about it to get everything that I saw and felt in detail so it will not slip into memory.   I just really hope I was not the only special one this night, so that this can be collaborated on by many other eyewitnesses.  Thanks for your consideration to take my account seriously.

There were about 50-100 of these balls all rising in small groups and all travelling in a line.  They were silent and lasted for about half an hour.

A friend and myself recently experienced a very unexplained site. We had both taken some time this weekend to drive up to Manistee for a weekend of backpacking.  We decided to take the Manistee River trail up the river and than the North Country trail to loop back around.  We unfortunately arrived later than we had planned and set onto the trail knowing that it would be getting dark in only a few hours.   As we hiked along, we made the decision to veer off the path and followed slagle creek North East from the place where it passed under the trail bridge.  It was already getting dark, but a sense of adventure and flashlights assisted our exploration.   Eventually, as we were seeking a clear and comfortable spot to set up camp for the night, it became quite pitch dark.  We began to observe however, that up ahead of us some ways was what seemed to be a rather bright ring of light illuminating a section of forest up ahead.  It was obscurred in distant trees, but was assumed by us to have been a camp set up or possibly a few vehicles parked in a clearing with their lights on.  As we continued in a direction that brought us closer to the spot where the lights were, we were surprised to not hear human voices or the sound of engines, rather, a different sound, one more like fans running or the hum of a dehumidifier only much more intense, almost pulsing.  We were at first very intrigued, then when we couldnt explain the scene we became confused.  We approached carefully with our flashlights now off as the spot with the lights was 50-75 yards away and seemed bright enough to allow us to navigate safely towards it.  We got to a point where I could tell that the spot in which it was seemed to be a clearing or treeless spot, and the there was a definite structure sitting there which looked as if its sides or its underneath had lights surrounding it.  I would guess from the position of the lights that the object was round, but I cannot be sure.  Also, we both believe that it was most likely and aproximately 20 feet in di ameter.   We probably came within 30 or so yards from it, but at that point I refused to get any closer.  In fact, after watching it for about 5 mins.,  I was ready to get the hell out of there.  My brain could not explain what my eyes saw, it was not normal,  and the only explanation I have was that it must have been something extraterrestrial, or extremely experimental.  We turned around and started heading back in a direction away from the scene, our backs turned toward the lights.  It was a hurried but carefull flight to find somewhere we felt more safe.  I remember hearing the humming sound fade as we pressed our way back through branches and brush.  I had to turn my flash light on and we were concentrating on what was ahead of us, but when we did look back the lights were gone.  We finally set up a camp near the creek and resolved to go back to where we were durring the daylight.  The next morning we did explore the area we had hiked to, but were not sure and unable to agree on where we had been the night before.  We found a few clearings and open type areas, some with pressed down and flattened grass that could have been the spots but niether of us were sure.  Over the next two days we finished our layed back hike, although I still feel that we experienced something not of this world, and I cant even begin to describe the oddity of seeing something that you cant explain, even after ruling out all logical possibilities in your head. When I returned home I got out some maps and tryed to determine exactly where we were at at the time of the sitting. I know for a fact that we were east of the Manistee River and the trail but certainly west of No. 1 road, and we were most likely North of S. Slagle Creek Rd. and somewhere south of Slagle Creek Rd./Blueberry Ln. This was the strangest thing I have ever experienced in my life.  I feel like I have seen something no one was intended to see.

We wanted to be certain that the report, which seemed serious-minded to us, was submitted as a sincere account of the person's experience.

It left an orange fiery trail. It appeared to be slightly larger than the moon and was extremely bright. It gave the appearance of burning up - almost like a plane crashing or something. Far too bright and large to be a meteor or a piece of space junk - especially with all the light pollution from the town. It appeared to be extremely close, 15 miles at the most, and very low altitude. My first thought was that it was actually a jet aircraft crashing.. the igniting fuel could explain the color... but there were no reports of anything of the sort. I thought about the possibility of a flare or fireworks... but the altitude seemed too high for that, plus there was no explosion, and the light appeared suddenly in the sky and continued on a steady trajectory heading diagonally downwards at what appeared to be free-fall speed - I don't know of any pyrotechnics that can behave like that. Since it looked as though something had crashed and it was extremely nearby, we drove up to the reservoir in the foothills just west of town and looked around. We didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Could this have been some kind of military exercise?

After I picked her up I proceeded to drive on Rt. 110 towards Harvard, MA to bring her to my Father's house. As I proceeded down the road, I saw a large bright yellow/pale orange light in the sky about 20 degrees on the Horizon, that was far brighter than any planet that should have been in the area of the Northwest Sky. I proceded to drive and look at the moon as a reference point and thought the light was moving very slowly. This really blew my mind, because I had no idea what this light could be. I broke off of Rt 110, and drove up a large hill towards the ""Fruitlands Museum"" in Harvard. Since there's a great view of the Northwest sky from this Orchard hill with many lookout points, we had to get a better look. As we pulled in, my sister and I jumped out of the car to watch this large glowing object varying in lighting intensity in the Northwest sky hovering about 20 degrees over the horizon over the prison hospital near the former Fort Devens. We watched this object slowly move up and down over the lights of the prison hospital for must have been 6 minutes. During this I called my girlfriend to describe what I was seeing and have her call her mother who lives close in the area to look at the sky. My sister also called her friend from her cell phone to look in the sky. As we were watching this object, we noticed lights circling in the cloud cover to the right of the object in the sky. We never saw any definitive objects or lights, but there were lights circling in the clouds making very erratic, then circular patterns.  There were no spotlights shining up from the ground.  There were many cars passing on Rt. 2 which is visible from this point, so someone else driving on the road has to have had to seen this object.  All of a sudden the light disappeared, just like it clicked off. Just moments after it shut off,  2 fast flying planes came into the area, I could hear them before I could see them. But saw lights on wings fly fast into the general area towards us, then bank around 180 degrees back towards the area we saw the craft. The planes flew around until we noticed there were no more lights shining in the clouds. We watched the sky for about 10 more minutes and saw nothing so we headed back home. We got home shortly after 11:00pm.   Now ontop of this story, I went to check the call time on my phone to see how long I was on the phone with my girlfriend. There was no record of this call on my cell phone when there should have been. There was no record of this call on my girlfriends phone.

On Saturday night, May 6th, 2006 at approximately 23:45, my two adult son's and I observed an unusual object moving accros the sky.  We were standing outside in an area devoid of light so that the evening sky was clear.  We were in Winona, Minnesota.  It was a beautiful night without a cloud in the sky. A loose formation of 4 points of white light traveling from East to West were observed.  The 4 points of light were of equal intensity, remaining constant at about the brightness level of a bright star.  The 4 objects were separate, moving independantly from one another, seaminly to dart about in a loose formation, all traveling together.  As we stood near a tall industrial building, the objects were seen as they came over the roof of the building and then disapeared about 5 seconds later. The most unusual thing about the objects was the area around and in-between them.  The space around and between the objects of the formation seamed to ripple as though the light from starts in the background was being distorted.  It was like a large bubble of water traveling across the sky, distorting the light, we could clearly see through it but distorted and rippling. There was absolutly no sound, silent.  Our first impression was that the objects were close.  It then appeared that the objects were at very high altitude (or maybe not even flying near the earth) traveling at a very high rate of speed.  Then, as the objects flew to a point about 90 degrees from the initial sighting, they just vanished.

I was driving through the Issaquah highlands heading north from the base of Tiger Mountain.  I looked up and saw a floating black V shaped object drifting just below the clouds.   I pulled over and stepped out of my car and watched it for about 10-15 minutes.  It didn’t move erratically.  It just floated, back and fourth, slowly ascending into the sky while heading eastward, maybe south eastward, towards Mount Si, and North Bend.   When I first saw it, it was low enough to see that it wasn’t a commercial airliner, it moved to slowly.  It definitely was not a paraglider, I hike Tiger mountain on a weekly basis and I see Para gliders take off all the time, I’ve even spoken to some of them about what it costs and what the conditions have to be like for a good flight.  They ride thermal pockets, and this day was far too windy and to cloudy to see any Para gliders.   The object just cruised, it seemed as if it was slowly gliding back and fourth, because the V shape was clear, then it flattened out as was just a black line floating through the sky.  It had no noise at all.  It was more curved than a B-2, which has sharp angles along the back.  The floating V was smooth, and it had no glimmer at all, no glint from the sun.   I watched it ascend and get further away, until it was a black dot far away in the sky.  As it got further I saw a slightly orange/brownish glow around it, it looked almost like a sunspot in the eye, that’s the only thing I can think of to compare it to.   That was about it, it wasn’t fast like a jet, it was too big to be a para glider, and it was definitely not a bird.   A black boomerang shape just floating through the sky casually.

UFO Sighting - 9pm, Feb. 11th, 2008 - Stroudsburg, PA  	I was driving home from NJ to the PA, on route 80 west. About 5 minutes after crossing the border into PA, while driving my car, I looked up and saw a fairly bright green light in the sky (the green light seemed to also have a little white to it, like as if it was a second smaller light). I watched it for about a second figuring it was just another plane, but about 2 seconds later this green light moved so fast (up and out toward the distance), in what it seemed was a straight line and stopped for a brief half-second at most, and then moved again and just vanished. The entire sighting was no more than 6 seconds.  	To best way visualize this would be as described: If I was holding a ruler in my hand while watching this object, looking into the sky, it was a good few miles away. Now I can't be for sure because it was dark out and depth perception is a little difficult for the circumstances I was in, but it was definitely a mile away in the sky. If you were a 6 foot tall person sitting back in the seat viewing this, from the middle of the steeling wheel if you measure up about 10 inches that is where the green light was. It stood still for about 2 seconds, then moved very quickly almost instantly about 4 inches and 25 degrees to the right and up. This tells me it moved what it seemed would be a mile or more further away in a short period of time. After it moved 4 inches it paused for a second, and kept going very quickly into the distance but at about a 30 degree angle this time. This pause was barely a pause. It was almost a flawless movement but was not a straight line.  	Overall, this was the first time I truly believe I've seen a UFO. I feel like I've never felt before after seeing that. It was like there was a lightning bug inches away from my car, and moved so quickly, and into the distance. I'm glad I saw what I did. I feel like all the events in my life, leading up to this drive to PA, due to something that happened in my life, being at the right place at the right time, and seeing this UFO, is the reason past events happened in my life... just to see the UFO tonight! I will never forget it. Thank you.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,40.9588,-75.3006

I immediately assumed it was an airplane and looked down as I continued walking.  After a few steps, I looked up again.  Instead of an airplane, I saw what appeared to be a star where I had seen the “airplane”.  Not a bright star, just an average star.  I then watched it as it quickly faded away, in a matter of 10 seconds or so, until nothing was there.  It did not appear to be moving, just fading away.  In complete silence.  I have never seen an airplane look like that.  First of all, when an airplane is that bright, it is coming toward you.  Second of all, it takes longer to fade out of sight when it is flying away.  And you usually see a flashing strobe light or the red and green wing lights.  But this just looked like a normal star that was fading away.

Our house faces the southeast, and we live in the country (14 miles from town and 50 miles from a big city).  The weather was fair and the sky was party cloudy.  Just before this happened, there were no commercial aircraft directly in view.  My 12-year-old daughter saw something unusual in the sky, to the southeast, and asked me what it was.  I watched for about 30 seconds, sure I could come up with a reasonable explanation (yet pretty curious because I didn't know what it was).  I saw 5 bright red lights (diamond-shaped), which were spaced at equal distances apart and flashed in sequence from right to left (like a strobe light).  After each sequence was complete, the object would move and appear in a different part of the sky.  I use the term ""object"" very loosely, as we could not see the object's profile nor did it make any noise.  Although its movement seemed jerky and unpredictable, the flashing lights were always in a straight line, as if the lights were attached to something straight, but the object was moving in a zigzag pattern.  Not sure what I was seeing, I called for my son (very much a skeptic and someone who always has an explanation for everything) to join us outside.  When he looked toward the sky, he responded with ""What the flying hell is THAT?!""  He had no idea what he was seeing, and no explanation.  We watch the sky for about 5 minutes, as the object blinked and moved erratically across the sky toward the northwest.  The lights never changed colors or patterns, except in the way the object(s) moved.  Whether in, or out of, cloud cover, we could clearly see the lights -- but never a shape.  The span across, from light to light, was MUCH WIDER than anything I've seen before.  I have watched commercial aircraft, helicopters, and various types of military aircraft fly over our farmland for the past 5 years, and I've never seen anything that could explain this.  Even fighter jets, when they play war games over our farm, are easy to see, move somewhat predictably, and make a lot of noise.  These lights were silent.  No noise whatsoever. The lights never changed color or shape.  There were no other lights, as you would expect to see on a commercial airplane.  As the object(s) moved further northwest, and nearing the end of my visibility, I saw see three red lights in a V pattern, but I didn't get to watch long enough to determine whether the original object was changing shape or if other(s) joined it.  If the lights I saw changed shape from a straight line into a V, I would have to wonder what happened to the remaining lights.  Within seconds of losing sight of this ""object"" or the lights, the sky was, once again, filled with commercial aircraft (and the noise you would expect them to make).",2007-10-08T00:00:00,,

Then I noticed that it would just sit still for a few seconds then dart very quickly in different directions. I then thought that it was very strange so I went in and asked my girlfriend to come out and see what I was witnessing. At first she said that it wasn't moving then all of a sudden it started darting around again. The light would change from red to a yellow white, and then to a greenish color. She said that it must be some type of military special plane or something that was making all of the darting movements and then hovering. She went in and I stayed out. All of a sudden it disappeared. I sat there for a few more minutes looking around and then a little further south and in a lower trajectory from me in the sky i saw what I thought was the same one but had just moved. After about 5 min. of watching that one I looked where the first sighting was and the original one was back. I watched both of them for a few minutes and the second one disappeared on me. The original one was moving up and down almost like it was dodging something. I thought maybe it was a comet that was changing colors due to temperature changes. She said that she didn't think so.

Apparent micrometeoroid flash  1)	I went outside the club around 9:10 p.m. tonight to get some air, and walked to a dark area near the end of a parking lot between some trees. At about 50 degrees SE of the zenith there was a bright cloud over Parker, CO, at a height of about 10,000-15,000 feet.  It was oblong and extended down to the horizon.  Otherwise the seeing was great overhead with a dark and crisp sky (usual for autumn in Colorado). 2)  	I looked up and found Cygnus (extending about 0-30 degrees southeast of the zenith), then over to the west to find Lyra (normal sky gazing for me), then back at Cygnus, and then slightly to the east. 3)  	A very faint micrometeoroid flash occurred in Lyra.  What struck me was that it was extremely faint, so short (less than 2 moon widths) and that it had a slight “j” hook to the east. This was at about 10-20 degrees SSW of the zenith. 4)  	Total sightig--about 1 second.  II. UFO  1)  	Following the trajectory of the micrometeoroid flash (contrail?), within  a second or so and starting about 10 degrees due south, I saw an object moving across the star field at an apparent high altitude, squareish, with a cluster of lights centrally located within the square (perhaps a violet and a white light, extremely faint, and perhaps 1-2 others). 2)  	The object at first moved generally east toward Cygnus, shifting erratically back and forth at 90 degrees, while jumping erratically 5+ degrees north and south, instantaneously. 3)  	The object appeared to maintain the same altitude throughout the sighting, and was less than ¼ of a moon width. It finally disappeared to the SE into the glare of the cloud over Parker, and I waited to see if it appeared under the cloud--it didn’t. 4)  	Total sighting- about 7 seconds.  III. Personal notes  1)	I’ve been a sky gazing hobbyist for over 45 years (I’m 54 now), and I know what to look for in the constellations. 2)	I’m a veteran of seven archaeological projects including a survey, and am used to looking quickly for unusual detail (20:13 vision). 3)	Except for some inconsistencies with the Nasca features and the nearby hill theory, or an occasional mutilation that goes against the predator theory, I’m afraid I’m pretty much a “Skeptical Inquirer” type.

I am genuinely scared and would appreciate someone to collaborate or explain what I saw. This new house I am renting doesn't allow smoking indoors so I went outside my window and sat on the roof enjoying the smoke. I saw 2 things just minutes apart which I cannot explain nor forget. It would have been around 1:00 or 1:05AM when I sat up and barely noticed something off in the sky. It looked like CGI or artists drawing of a comet. It had that leading umbrella like front that a comet does, but it had no tail. It looked like it had a wedge shape but you could only make out a front and the ""back"" wasn't visible. It moved from right to left from in the sky and was all but invisible against the sky. I only noticed it because it was moving and it seemed very far away and was very faint. As its view crossed across a streetlight it was obscured (washed out by the light). When it came back into view its wedge shape seemed a less of a point and much more rounded in front. It didn't do anything specific and very well could have been a comet, but I doubt it as it would have had to move across the sky line in 1-2 minutes. I took 2 pictures with my cell phone but nether show anything except that light across the street (it was that faint). I was pretty freaked out and called my friend in VA and talked to her about it and while I was on the phone something else happened and now I am scared in my room. I was on the phone with this girl and getting anxious about what I saw and was about to walk through my window when I saw 3 lights VERY CLOSE. If anyone is familiar as to how low the planes fly over Arlington, VA (above the buildings and high rises) when flying into National Airport, it seemed to be about the highest height the planes take before they drop altitude for final approach. That is to say it was so close that I would have heard something. It moved from right to left and was very very close. This defiantly had a triangular isosceles shape (from the 3 lights being in the corner). It was nearly straight above me and moved in a straight line or maybe it had a slight curve to its path. The lights did not illuminate a body of any sort but kept a perfect triangular shape. There was no blinking, NO NOISE and no fucking way I want to see it again. It was fast, but if it was as close as I think it was then it wouldn't have been as fast as the faint/far first object I saw. My friend on the phone was panicing because I was panicing and I woke one of my new roommates but he didn't want anything to do with it. At least he saw the fear I had. If anyone has any idea what it was or can collaborate what was in the sky please please post it. BTW, I have been in Austin less then 24 hours and I am almost willing to pack the car and move back to DC... deposit be damned. I won't be sleeping tonight until my roommates wake up, it isn't as though I'm a coward, far from it. I just can't explain what it is. If I could explain it or understand it or even deny it I'd probably feel a lot better right now. Thanks,",2007-10-08T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

This object is definitely not a star as we’ve never seen or heard of stars being colorful or that move. Our planet doesn’t rotate that quickly. We observed this object with both binoculars & a telescope. We noticed the object was moving rather slowly but on a due east course tonight. The colors were absolutely brilliant & something none of us have ever seen before. Not only was it colorful & sphere-shaped but it seemed to rotate, spin, & turn sideways. It also would move just enough for us to lose sight of it from our telescope without us moving the tripod. We wanted to know what this thing was, so we came in to look up anything we could find on the internet that might relate to this object being seen by others & we found nothing.  At 12:15 am we went back out to see just how much further this object had moved, when we were amazed by the fact that not only had this object moved further east, but there were two additional objects exactly the same as the one we’d been following all night in a perfect triangular formation. They were not there prior to the earlier observation! We observed all three of them & all were exactly the same. One might say that they were hovering, but you could see them move slightly & yet all remained in perfect triangular formation. We really got a little freaked out, besides being cold & we came back in again. So this was going on for over 3 hours & then some! They are still out there very visible even now.

The display was first seen from the west side of a neighborhood in North MIlton-Freewater, and slowly moved East on top of a cloud formation. Three light balls were counted, but only two of which interacted with each other in a playful dancing motion, while the third spent most of the time hovering to the left. 	No light trail from any angle was visible, nor did the balls of light move in any uniformed pattern. They resembled the shape of Saturn, with a horizontal plane piercing through the center of their somewhat oval shape. The size of these light balls were relatively close to the size of a full moon but had no defined lines or color. 	The balls of light moved above a cloud formation heading East. When the spectators stopped at the East end of Raspberry Loop to watch them, a dancing display captured their attention till nearly 11:00 pm. Mostly viewed where chasing motions from each direction, spiral patterns, and the occasionally collisions resulting in a spark of extra light. 	When the two spectators headed back to the West side of the street, the balls of light shifted in the direction they were walking.

I looked up through the front windsheild directly in front of the car. At first glance I thought I saw a plane landing at the airport, a black plane with it's ""landing"" lights on and a flashing red light on the side opposite of the ""landing"" lights, as I could see two distinct beams of light that looks similar to a car's headlights in a light fog. The weather was clear, I just looked at the NWS website, the weather at the Airport was: Wind S 9 MPH; Visibility 9 Miles; 23 Degrees. Then I realized that the plane was ascending with the beams of lights facing the opposite direction that it was traveling (it was traveling from west to east), my second thought was, oh this must be a helicopter because of the craft's movement patterns. It slowed down and began to hover for about 10 seconds, it then turned its two beams of lights towards the south (90 degrees left) and began to slowly accelerate to about 20 MPH or so. By the time the craft was almost directly overhead (coming right towards us at about the same height you typically see news helicopters fly) it became clear to me that this was no helicopter, as I could see the crafts distinct flat perfectly triangular hull, there seems to be no way that a fixed wing aircraft could travel that slow, I saw no propellers. It immediately sent chills through me when I saw it. I could tell that both my Grandpa and I, both familiar with aircraft, were interested in the craft, after it went by my Grandpa, typically a skeptic of anything, said, ""What the heck was that thing?

I was not able to capture a photo, but when I saw the one provided at Puget Sound, I realized that it was the same object. I have seen this object on several occasions for the past year, always in the early morning.  But, there are always two of the objects; one followed a moment or two after the first. Until this morning, they always appeared as an almost pinpoint circular object traveling at a high rate of speed, with approximately an inch-wide (from my vantage point) vapor trail. Hills and mountains surround me.  The direction of the first object is from the Southern sky traveling North West.  The second object comes from a bit more South West direction, heading North West also, with the same width vapor trail. My daughter, niece, and grandson have witnessed these sightings and it was during the summer months. For the past few days, the dogs in our neighborhood have been howling late at night and in the early morning hours.  Late last night when they howled, I ignored the dogs as usual.  This morning their howling woke me up.  I went to the bathroom, came back and noticed the moonlight in my room.  I went to the window to look at the full moon. It was 5:22 am and I saw a vapor trail traveling from the North Western sky.  I was looking out of my North West window that is facing a bright full moon.  The moon was at a 45-degree angle from the horizon.   Visibility was 3 miles.  The stars were brilliant.  Our altitude in Mountain House is 160 feet. I witnessed the object from my loft space, which is approximately 20 feet high. The object was traveling this time from North West heading in a Southern direction and it was only when it traveled in front of the moon that I could see that it was a RED fiery circular object. When it left the light of the moon, it appeared as a pinpoint circular object again.  The sound that it made was high pitch and similar to a vacuum cleaner whirring, unlike commercial aircraft or jets engines.  It appeared to be traveling from the horizon up into the sky. I went outside and saw the object continuing it’s Southern path.  I couldn’t hear the sound anymore because it was traveling higher in the sky. As with the Pugent Sound sighting, there has been increased helicopter activity over this tiny community, often in pairs searching in the exact location where we’ve seen the UFOs. I believe these objects to be unlike any aircraft that is known and I respectfully submit this sighting as being genuine in nature. Thank you for the opportunity to share this experience.  ============================== PUGET SOUND, WASHINGTON STATE, MONDAY, MAR 5 2007 AT 19:15 HRS The National UFO Reporting Center received three reports of a peculiar, red object, which was observed from multiple points on the western side of Puget Sound. One of the witnesses  captured the object with her digital camera.  Full Report  If there are other witnesses to the event, we would welcome more reports which include 1) the witness's location, 2) the direction the witness was looking, and 3) the angle of elevation (estimated) to the object, above the horizontal plane.  We do not know what the object was, but it almost certainly was not any type of conventional aircraft, and given the duration of the event, and the manner in which the object was seen to move across the sky, we doubt that the object was any type of pyrotechnic device.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,,

I am speaking of a sighting that my friends and I had of what could only be explained as a UFO.  They told me that they had filmed the incident and I came over to see what they had,  My lead guitar player and myself joined our friend with our own camera the next morning when at approx. 5:15 not only did it do a repeat performance, but it was followed by another craft of approximately the size of 5 football fields.  The smaller craft looked like sparks in the early morning sky, and we didnt even know they were smaller craft until we slowed the film down to frame by frame, and were amazed to see many of them entering and leaving the larger craft.    The air around where they flew seemed to be mixed up like ripples in the water, it was like looking into water, and like someone took a sponge lightly dipped in paint and went over what was really there.  This cloaking activity seems inherent after sunrise, and the only time we have been able to actually SEE them is right at sunrise before the sun rises high enough over head for them to reflect the sky back at themselves.  So I went back again with my digital camera, which has filming capability for short spurts of time, and waited.  I almost thought (even though this was a week later) that I wouldnt see a thing, but right at 5:23 the sun started comingup and there they were , like they appeared out of nowhere, this one took off to the east.  I lost sight of it around Bailey hill, and figured Id have to wait another day, however as I got closer to home, (13 miles away from where we had photographed  them, I went under the train trestle down the street from my house, looked up and bigger than shit there it was.  I barreled down the driveway grabbed my camera and bolted up to the street in time to catch it on an .avi file.   The next day, my friend Bobby calls me and tells me that he caught it landing on the far side of the power plant, the far side of the power plant is delta of the Sacramento River, and an island that is mostly marsh and hazardous waste.  No one goes there, no one human anyway.  I figured that since they were appearing close to the power plant that the draw of the electricmagnetic field had to have something to do with them appearing there over and over again. So 4th of July, we went up and w atched fireworks from Bobbys back yard on the top of the hill above Bart in Pittsburg, California,  I took off at about 1 am telling them i was going to get my high powered telescope, my bushnells and my old fashined type of VCR recorder, you know the type that actually took the big VCR tapes to record?  I was back at 4 pm. setting up the telescope and the vcr recorder to watch the sky.  I had a feeling whatever we would see this day was going to be HUGE. and buddy i tell you what it was freaking HUMONGUS.  The size of the city of Concord at the very least. With hudreds of hundreds of the size flying ships that only days before we were referring to as ""mother ship""  WHAT A LAUGH!  OH MY GOD.  The video I got of it this morning, actually shows movement on the ship, shows crafts set to depart, on platforms that swing upwards to a sinister or forward slash direction, and when the ships departed, they didnt go straight up, the platform they rested on inclined, and these fast mother flockers left with the force and speed of a projectile,   what looked like might be a jet trail, turned out to be motion blur.  We found all kinds of sparks and fast movement in the sky that many were unable to be seen by the naked eye.  As a matter of fact, when you pointed the camera at them, you could not see the craft on the preview screen of the camera at all, and looking through the eyehole, they werent there either, we had to just point the cameras in the general direction, hit the zoom and width mode and even then sometimes couldnt see them until you slowed the film down by 900 percent.  i AM going to try to translate the film to my computer from the TV somehow and copy it to a DVD.  But I tell you what I am so blown away by the whole thing I dont even know what to think say or do.  The blow away at dawn was looking at what appeared to be an elogated fireball, with the multitude of disks and smaller craft, AND stationary ""buildings"" with activity able to be seen usning the zoom lense of the camera.

As I neared it appeared to be just above the treetops and the lights were very bright.   I stopped my car and looked at it sticking my head out of the window.  There was no engine noise and I could not make out a distinct shape because of the light and a foggy mist which enhanced the bright light effect, but my impression was it was long shaped  (?cigar vs cylinder). I was afraid to leave the car and was aware that I had a patient waiting for me in the ER. The craft then began to move to the southwest (behind me) at a slow rate of speed.

Friend of mine was respecting my rule to open kitchen window to smoke and blow it out, when she started screaming for me to come immediately. It took me all of 2 seconds to reach that window. What we saw was mind blowing. The sky was completely illuminated. You could literally see the tops of all of the trees as well as 3 layers of colors above them.  One  layer  was baby blue, another  was gray , third was almost white. (truthfully can’t report in which order…..sorry) The big or little dipper (not sure) was clearly illuminated in the sky to our left as well as tons of other stars we had been unable to see earlier due to the oncoming storm. We could not take our eyes off these bright objects!  The large one, was over the little one and had a red lights underneath it. It appeared to be in the shape of an octagon, but it kept darting so quickly that I can’t swear to that. The large shape kept hovering and darting all around the little light and then it just took off, like lightening! It was so quick that I could have sworn I saw a stream behind it, but it could have been my eyes adjusting to that incredibly quick exit. I don’t know. I do know that the little light kept shining and moved sporadically and much slower than the big one. I then brought my 5 year old to the window and asked him what he thought. (He was not privie to anything we had just experienced.) His retort was “Mommy, It looks like an eye and I don’t like it looking at me, can I go back and do my lessons on the computer now? “  I , unlike my pal am exhilarated. She is on the other hand, terrified. Go figure. Who the hell is gonna believe either one of us, eh? Here is the testimony of my terrified friend in her words;  I was smoking out the window when I saw this bright light in the trees out back. It kept going up and down gradually. Next thing I knew it was on top of the tree tops again. I saw an octagon shape at that point. It started going up and down through the trees and that’s when I started paying more attention, When the lights started going up and down faster I admit I freaked and shouted to my friend to come and see this for yourself girl. That’s when I saw the octagon shape with lots of white, green and red lights. We both stared in disbelief.

I was walking my dog and lights to my right caught my attention.  I cannot give them a true color as we know it…they were not white and not yellow.  They had a very “warm” hue, yet bright and steady.  There were no blinking lights like in aircraft I’ve seen flying.  The shape was between a triangle & horseshoe.  Not as sharp as a triangle yet more pointed than a horseshoe.  The area is very close to a military base so I am VERY used to aircraft, but what was most odd about this is that it was not the sound that caught my attention - but how inordinately low & how methodically it was flying. There was an odd, methodical  steadiness of the lights and movement.  The other odd thing was once I noticed it, I could then hear a soft (almost muffled) sound. The closest description I can give is that it sounded more like a soft muffled whooshing than the engines of a plane, military plane or helicopter.  In hind-sight when I think of the soft whooshing sound & lights I would almost describe the combination of the two as an “energy“ of some kind.  Needless to say I had a very conscious thought that if I didn’t know better I’d say that is a UFO…..but then low & behold (almost as if it heard me) it literally hovered for just a second (no more than 2) right above this exceptionally large pine tree that stands out above the tree line and hung there in a complete stopped position.  As I started to move further out onto my drive to make sure I was REALLY seeing this “plane” just hovering, it lowered straight down.  No angle to the lowering, just a straight line down at the same methodic speed it had been flying.  Having asked a question or two (while trying not to make anyone think I’m crazy) I have determined there is actually about a 30 acre field within ¼ mile of where it appeared lower straight down.  I stood there for about 4 minutes waiting to see if it would come back up. I went back into the house I immediately told my boyfriend what I just experienced.   Another VERY important note is about 3-4 minutes after I came back into the house I heard an exceptionally LOUD boisterous military aircraft engine fly directly over my home.  I again ran outside to see what was going on & though you could clearly hear the military plane (& the house was vibrating from it) I could not readily see the aircraft.  Now this we’re used to hearing regularly - NEVER so close above the house but it undoubtedly flew directly overhead.  Again in hind-sight I can’t help but think it was following or looking for it.  One other important note I‘d like to make, it was not flying from or towards the military base…if I had to give it a direction it appeared to be flying towards the Hudson River.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,41.5303904347826,-74.04801391304348

I was just walking down my street on early Thursday(January 17th 2008)between 1:00 and 1:30 am and as I turned the corner heading East I noticed something that appeared like a cloud but strangely concentrated with a part that trailed away from the bottom of it's sort of diffused spherical shape! It was not moving when I first looked at it. It was hovering pretty low for a 'cloud' (as the actual clouds were at a higher altitude) at the corner of my street. It was low enough to feel it could get to me pretty quickly if it needed to! When it actually started moving East the bottom part was trailing in the opposite direction that the object was going and was somewhat conical. The object was white and had a brightness to it like a little light from within but not super bright as I have seen a brighter object in the past, and this object pales in comparison. It was brighter than the actual clouds that it drifted past and appeared to be about the same size as a regular sized (when not too close to earth in it's orbit) full moon in diameter. So I get a few feet away from the corner and as I am still eyeing what I thought at first was a strange looking cloud. I notice this thing has moved with me, it's kept pace with me give or take a few steps, as it really began to appear to be following me fairly closely. I was heading for my local coffee shop to get out and get some fresh air and some decaf and instead I get stalked by some mysterious cloud like object! Well I picked up the pace to confirm that it was following and to see if it could keep up and I can walk very fast, so this was a good test! Sure enough it was keeping up with me up until I get to the tunnel/underpass which I had to turn into to get to my destination. So to see if I could lose the object at this opportune moment of quick cover I picked up the pace a little more to get into the tunnel and into my destination without it seeing where I went to. I get to the other side of the tunnel (approx. 40 feet in length) and look up to see nothing hovering anywhere. It would seem like I had lost the object, as I kept watching and I walked approaching my destination. I took one last look before I entered the drive to the local coffee shop and saw no object. It probably only took me 13 minutes to walk to my destination. So I am in the coffee shop for about 20 to 30 minutes or so and decide it's time to head back home. While I was in the coffee shop I thought to myself I will walk back home a different way just in case this thing is still hanging around or hiding out somewhere near where I was walking before. So I walk out of the coffee shop and start heading toward the tunnel and there is the object but at a distance not as close as it was before when it followed me. It seemed it was in the part of the sky back near where it started following me near my home but on the opposite side of the highway from where it was originally. It was on the South side of the hIghway when it started following and now it was on the North side but back in the West from where I started walking. So I walked South in another way to go back home instead of going the quicker way back, the way I came, to see if it would still follow me. For the first little while it did not seem to catch up but then in no time it was right behind me when I was about halfway home taking the side streets in a western direction after I had walked a little ways south. Since it seemed determined to follow me and since it seemed as if it had been waiting for me practically outside my door (thinking it may know exactly where I live, or it will because it's following me home now) I might as well slow down my pace to make sure it follows me home and I don't lose it temporarily again . I decided that because I would like to try and snap a couple of quick pictures of the 'stalker' if I got back intact and inside to get my camera, but to no avail! As I felt a little threatened by it following me home I warned whatever it was that I was protected so don't mess with me. I also had the thought in my mind that as soon as I get to my door I'm going to race inside and get my camera, beca use someone needs to see this! Seconds after this about three quarters of the way home I could no longer see the object, maybe my warning or threat of be caught on camera made it leave or something else did that I could not see!",2008-01-21T00:00:00,,

On the day of this incident, a friend and I went to explore a field and empty reservoir in this field. We wanted to come back to it that night, and enjoy the moon and conversation away from town life. We came back with another person that night. We walked to the end of the field for no reason in particular, and noticed 2 orange lights over the trees. They were moving quite slow, sometimes not moving at all. They appeared small, as if they were planes. They would head east away from the ocean. They would circle around and disappear behind the hills. They usually appeared in twos, separated by quite a distance. They would always appear from behind hills or trees. They sometimes appeared from nothingness. They would sometimes turn off the lights, and then appear with light configuration like jet planes. They had up to 7 lights, most commonly 2 headlights with “wing” lights and up to 3 lights in the back. But they were too low and too fast and silent, and were not jet planes. At times we could see up to 6 in the air. We called our friend and he came with his girlfriend. We watched the triangle and squares and diamond crafts fly around, like bees. They would often change path, and were just observing. It seemed that other crafts would appear in the paths of other crafts. We had a flashlight, and when I flashed patterns on the field one turned its headlight toward us and changed course to fly directly above us. They were triangular in shape when we saw them from below. From the sides, they appeared oblong and very large. They appeared very bright, and I do not think jets or prop planes have these bright of headlights. Our observations were mildly disturbing, and 4 of us were convinced they were UFO’s, but the only girl with us was still skeptical. This was about to change. Over a hedgerow cypress forest, 2 lights, dime sized to us only 1,500 feet away, hovered for maybe 2 minutes. There was a faint glowing aura in the trees below. They moved slowly around, and we could see one turn away and he! ad for t he ocean. The other continued closer to us, within 600 feet, following a drainage ditch it seemed like. It hovered to the highway, and looked at the traffic from about 700 feet up. It then went over the hills and disappeared. We could see it with binoculars, and it had a bright halogen like head light, and a green light on the back with a red light above it. On the back were 2 white lights, with a red light underneath each one. It looked like an observer. The red light blinked very faintly. After this one had left, we didn’t see anymore that night. We left to pick up some food.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,37.4436,-122.4124

I am an amatuer astronomer, and have spent many nights watching satellites passing by.

The more I watched it, I was able to make out some detail, even though it was a small white-blue point of light with something attached to its rear.  For a second it seemed that there were four or five much smaller white lights surrounding it as well.  Then I lost sight of it because there was a few whisps of clouds that eventually obscured it.

There was a large bight star-like object to my north and out of the corner of my eye to my east there was what appeared to be a shooting star, but not your every day shooting star it caught my eye about 30 seconds later there was an explosion of star-like dust in the east where this star-like object fell.  I turned my attention towards the bright glowing light to my north and it was no longer heading away from me, it was moving towards the east towards the explosion of star-like dust.

One of the objects headed towards the far east traveling south and the other headed towards the object that was flying in from the north east.  The large starry like object started to lose its brightness.  Again, another star-like object fell from the sky in the same area where the first star-like object fell.  There were other planes in the area that had flashing red and blue lights and I knew for a fact that it was not a plane or commercial plane messing around in this area at this particular time.  I sat in my car and notified the York County Police of this incident.  There was nothing they could do so they gave me a number to call to report this matter.

There were 3 tiny objects, silver in color bouncing off of each other in the random direction but in a closed radius.

I use the vehicle headlights to illuminate the front door while locking the office on particular dark nights.  Looking immediately west I noticed what appeared to be the landing lights of an aircraft approaching the Eau Claire airport.  Note, the office is right under a normal flight path for Northwest Airline flights coming from the Twin Cities and it is very common to see the landing lights used on their approaches to Eau Claire.  In any case I attributed the exceptionally bright light to that of an aircraft on approach.  The light was due west at an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 feet in altitude and coming slowly east on a trajectory that would have put it right over the office on River Road in less than a minute.  I watched it for a few seconds and did not see anything out of the ordinary but I did notice there was no sound coming from the area of the light.  With approaching aircraft it is normal to hear them a minute before one is able to make a visual.  But it was late, I was tired, and I thought nothing more of it until I started my drive home it seemed to alter its course rapidly.  Leaving east out of the driveway the object essentially stopped for a brief second or two and changed course to north-northwest course and began lowering in altitude.  I turned north on a cut-off road to Highway 170 and watched as the craft moved slowly northwest and dropped in altitude on slightly as it was still much higher than the surrounding hills.  I turned west on Hwy 170 and watched the craft moving in the direction towards the Wheeler radio tower.  Total drive of about 2 miles and a time of about 4 minutes.  As I turned into my house driveway I lost site of the object behind a row of tall pine trees and a hill.  I entered my house, scrambled for a few minutes tying to find a pair of binoculars – to no avail.  So I got my girlfriend to come with out in the field to see if we could locate the object.  As we rounded the blocking hill we easily made visual contact with the craft again.  At this time the light was farther away but still very bright and more red flickering taking place.  The location appeared to be slightly sou! th of th e radio tower and about 1,000 to 2,000 feet higher than the top of the tower (the tower is about 1,000 ft.).  I must qualify that the craft appeared to be near the tower, it could have been farther west of the tower but it more likely was nearby.  As we watched for several minutes it appeared as if it was not moving.  Then it decided to start slowly lowering sometimes straight down and sometimes with erratic zigzag patterns.  Eventually it was at the same height reference of the Wheeler tower and stayed there for a few minutes.  Then it started to lower again and this time it moved slightly more north in what appeared to be very close proximity to the tower itself. Eventually it dropped to a point where we could only see it at random through trees and hills.  In the last few minutes of visual it seemed as though the object was on the ground moving around between trees.  The motions as it was on, or near, the ground were slightly erratic and we had to shift positions frequently to keep it in sight.  Finally about midnight or slightly after we lost all visual sight. Her and I watched the light for about 15 to 20 minutes.  Short of the time I lost sight in my driveway and was looking for the binoculars I was able to watch the craft for about 25 to 30 minutes total time.  Shortly after midnight we  took a drive to the radio tower location.  There were several households with lights on in the immediate vicinity of the radio tower.  We do not know if these people were awake, or saw something, or whatever but we did not stop to ask for fear of being ridiculed.  Neither my girlfriend nor myself can explain what it was but we do know for an absolute fact we watched something very strange.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,45.0362,-91.7299

At 9:03 pm last night I went out to put my car windows up and a bright light in the southern sky caught my eye.  I looked up and saw a round, very, very bright light moving in a northeasterly direction.  I watched for a few seconds observing the object.   There were no flashing lights, no strobing lights, no identifying lights as seen on the many planes that fly in our skies at night from the local airport.  There was no trail of any kind either.  It appeared to be a light - not something on fire or burning.   I quickly went to the porch, opened the door and called to my 14 yr old grandson to come look.  He came out and observed the object as well.  He said, ""Gram, get your camera!""  I said, ""What is that?  It is so bright and moving so fast.""   The light never changed in brightness or appearance as it approached me, passed over us, or moved away from us.  It appeared to be traveling at a low altitude and at a very high speed.  There was no sound to be heard as this object approached, flew over us and flew away from us.   Before we lost sight of it beyond the trees, my grandson was observing it with the binoculars:  I said, ""Look there is a plane headed in its direction (the plane was heading north and was in the eastern sky).  The plane had to have been at a much higher altitude as it appeared as a pin dot to us, but you could clearly make out the red flashing lights.  The unknown object was very large in size in comparison to the plane and to the stars that were out at the time. I have never seen anything like this before in my entire life.   One other note:  The object seemed to zig-zag a few times as it was moving away from us.  This was a very odd experience.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,43.3006,-73.5859

My Husband first noticed a orange looking circular shape appear over the ocean. He pointed it out to the rest of us thinking at first that it could be some sort of spotlight from a helicopter or plane. Within a minute or two the light suddenly dissapeared and reappeared in seconds above the coast line to the right of it's original location. This flashing from left to right went on for approx. 5 or more minutes. There was no sound, no flashes, no type of trail as though from any form or flare or fired round. The lights stopped for a couple of minutes and then reappeared more extravagent. I personally witnessed the light appear over the ocean and then another orb seemed to stretch out of the original. The cloned orange orb moved faster than light to the far right and then in a quick spinning type motion the light stretched and lines appeared in it. Those went away and then suddenly 4 different ones appeared with the last one to remain being in the same spot as the one that had spun. That one two spun and they all vanished. This lasted from the time we noticed it for about 34 minutes central time. There were no planes, no helicopters, no jets, etc. and no sound at all. I never believed in anything and am still not sure of what it could have been except that of a UFO considering the fact that we can not identify it. The beach was full of crab hunters, so others who may not have been focused upon the beach could have witnessed this as well. We did observe these through bonoculars, however by the time we thought to grab a camera the lights stopped. I guess our word is all we have though the lights stayed long enough to get plenty of pictures, I think we were all more stunned than anything.

It is about 10:23 P.M. on June 06, 2007.   My husband and I are both educators with Masters Degrees.    I am describing an object that my husband and myself both see in the sky that has very bright pulsating lights that appear to have a shape not unlike a cross.  Long thin irregular  beam-like tenical shapes radiate out in several directions with one of the beam-like shapes splitting on the end not unlike a strand of hair with a split end.  The beam-like shape with the split end appears on the left side of the aircraft as we are viewing it looking up into the sky.  It is fascinating to look at.  The craft has a muted haze around it and is moving very very slow in what seems to be a westward direction.  Red lights appear on the top side of the craft then disappear and then blue lights appear near to the red light area and disappear as well.  They appear to be attached to something my husband describes as tenicals hanging down.  The aircraft appears to be quite huge.  The bottom has dark shapes and helps to identify a middle shape that at certain times appears rounded.  It appears to have sides that slope upward from the bottom which at certain angles appear box-like in shape.   A red light appeared on the bottom that seemed to run in what looked like a section down the middle of its bottom.  The light appears to be 20 times brighter than our normal heavenly stars.  The craft appears visually to be large enough to hold at least 20 stars inside it.  It is huge.  At times the aircraft seemed to be hovering and tilting a little.  It also appeared to move toward us smoothly and quickly for a short distance then it would appear to stop moving towards us and continue in a westward direction. It is interesting to note that our normal heavenly stars appeared to be dim in comparison to the intense bright light coming the aircraft.  It was almost as if the aircraft was using the light from the stars to make its own light bright and the normal star’s lights to dim. In conclusion the strange aircraft was interesting and fascinating to look at and watch because it was so unusual in the light shapes and the various light activity as it hovered and slowly moved in the sky.  It moved so slowly at times that it appeared to be standing still in the sky.  My husband and nor I have ever seen anything like it.  It was incredible.  Even though no true detail could be seen like one would be able to see if it were daylight and the aircraft were to be close or whatever it was amazing to experience the indicated shapes through light and dark shapes.  I would like to know what it was.  It was a neat experience. My Husband watched it for about an hour after I came inside to report it.  He said that it was still there when he came in and seemed to still be moving slowly in a westward direction.  We are located east of the city of Morehead Kentucky in the country.  Morehead Kentucky is located in Southeastern Kentucky. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of a celestial body, we suspect.  PD))",2007-06-12T00:00:00,38.2075,-83.3989

He explained to me he had spotted the object and was watching it and noticed there were no flashing lights like a plane or helicoptor have on the outside, and the object seemed to be perfectly round in shape and all white (like a perfectly round ball of light). It was flying at a really high altitude, but still very visable.  My husband does not believe in aliens and he thinks UFO's are probally just new top secret aircraft by the government.  However when 2 fighter jets scrambled and began after the object he called me out to see.  I observed the white object in the clear night sky and I watched it streak across the sky in a straight path.  After the jets took off  (we live close to the airport) it went off it's then straight path and began to rapidly zig zag from one point to another.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing, no known aircraft I know about could be moving like that.

Whatever it was sounded like a plane, not a helicopter, but there were none of the blue or red flashing lights you usually see on plane wings; it was just a white light that would come completely on, the go completely off, so you couldn't see it at all in the split-second that the light was off. Just after this light disappeared, two planes appeared to the north and the difference was marked -- their lights appeared more yellow and they appeared to be moving much slower than whatever else we saw. Anyway, it was different, so there it is. Thanks.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

Honolulu resident Peter Hollingworth described as two lights circling in the sky, about 45 degrees above the horizon. Video of one of the lights was recorded from the Channel 2 SkyCam. ""These two little fireballs with a stream behind it,"" said Hollingworth.  ""Looked kind of like a shooting star, but it just kept going. They changed directions a few times, at first it was coming in then it turned, Then it went out then it came back in again""  Hollingworth was surfing with his 12 year old son when the unexpected show began. ""I was a little concerned. I told him come over and sit with me - this might be the last surf session we ever have together because this thing's coming straight for Honolulu.  It looked deadly to me it was kind of spooky.""   So what was it?  The National Weather Service says nothing showed up on their radar at the time of the sighting and the Federal Aviation Administration didn't report anything unusual. The U.S. military conducted a missile defense test off of Kauai Friday evening but the test didn't begin until 7:20 p.m. ""This in a sense is an unidentified flying object,"" said University of Hawaii astronomy professor Gareth Wynn-Williams.  ""It's something in the sky that's moving that we haven't identified.""  Wynn-Williams believes there's a simple explanation behind the UFO’s. ""It's probably a contrail of some kind,"" he said while watching video of one of the lights at his Kailua home. The professor says contrails are caused by high flying airplanes burning hydrogen based fuels. One of the byproducts of the fuel exhaust is water. ""The air is very cold so the water condenses and forms like drops very quickly and then these drops stay behind the plane until eventually they warm up and they evaporate.""  Wynn-Williams doubts little green men from Mars are behind the UFO’s. ""Some people just think differently than scientists and they like to look for the fanciest most exciting explanation. Those people would like to think it's little green men, I think that's very unlikely.""  According to published reports this is not the first time a UFO has grabbed the attention of Hawaii residents. In December of 2004 an unexplained streak of light was captured by a camera on Haleakala moving southwest to northeast. No official explanation has been given for that UFO either.

I and my son riding in the front seat saw a fiery object rapidly descending from the sky to the east of our position. My son in the rear seat did not see it.  The object was orange (according to my son; I am color blind), it appeared to me to be the color of fire).  At first I thought it might be a shooting star but it lasted a bit too long and appeared to be very close to earth. I then thought it might be a flare or, perhaps, an exploding transformer since the temperature was below zero Fahrenheit.  But it seemed to fall way too rapidly and in too straight a path to be either of those things.  It doesn’t seem plausible that it was any known aircraft since it featured just the one fiery light. It looked like it might have landed behind our house, perhaps within hundreds of feet.  Of course if it was a large object, it’s possible it fell miles away.  Less than three miles to the east here takes you over the ocean.    Green Valley Road is a sparsely populated neighborhood in a very small town in a very rural state. To give you some perspective, our back yard is 44 mostly wooded acres.  Anyway, we went up the road a few hundred yards to see if anything was smoldering but saw nothing of the sort.  We took a listen but the wind was howling with gusts, I believe, of more than twenty miles per hour, perhaps twice that.  Obviously, conditions not conducive to detecting unusual sounds. I speculate it was a meteor or a piece of space junk.

(Our friend’s home is north of Hendersonville, TN and is located near Beech High School.  The visibility of the night sky is fantastic, as no strong city-light presence exists.)   He came out to his garage and we both noticed an unusual set of fairly-bright lights back toward the southwest.  I got back out of my car, not looking away from the set of lights, and asked him if he was seeing those lights as well.   He commented out loud that he’s never seen anything like that before.  (He and I work for the same company, where he’s been a technical engineer for 25+ years.)   The two set of lights were approximately the size of peas, at arm’s length.  The lower set of lights seemed to have blinking/nav-lights on the outer edges.  Basically, both sets initially appeared the same; three lights across a plane with the middle being brighter and the outer two blinking at times. Both sets of lights hung motionless for approximately 3-5 minutes.  The lower set started to dim then slowly dropped downward and arced off toward the east.  We lost sight of it when it dropped below the ridgeline. The remaining (slightly higher) set of three lights, still hung motionless for another few minutes.   After simply hanging there for a few minutes, the middle light started growing in intensity.   So much so, that my buddy and I were still talking out loud about it (not taking our eyes off of it) asking each other if we were seeing them same things. My six year old daughter came outside and saw them too.  She freaked out, hearing us talking about them in wonderment, and ran back inside.  (We had a good chuckle about that.)   The middle light grew so bright, that the three lights appeared to merge into a single light.  That’s the best I can describe how much it grew in intensity. After about a minute or two of that brilliance, it appeared to also start descending and arcing off toward the east. The point at which both of these sets of lights dropped and started arcing off toward the east, it really reminded me of the way a normal aircraft would have localized and turned toward the traffic pattern to land.   However, neither of us has ever seen anything quite like this before.  (I have been an aviation enthusiast for 25+ years and consider myself very knowledgeable of the subject matter.)   I watched the local news reports, hoping to see/hear any references to this event as I’m sure this happened near, or just to the north of, Nashville proper.  However, I did not hear any mention of it.   These could have been some military aircraft, but I have never seen any night-landing configuration quite like it; nor have I watched something like this just hang motionless in the sky for several minutes, all without any sound.   These lights were close enough to have produced some engine-signature, had they been normal aircraft.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,36.34762547770701,-86.60062420382165

My friend and I went outside to smoke a cigarette around 11:00 PM 11/26 and witnessed a light circling around in the sky above my backyard. I also woke my mother up to see it, as well.   At first we thought it may be a spotlight (a new club opening up or something), but the center of the activity was in a strictly residential suburbian area and the light changed its course, moving eradically slow then fast and not in a perfect circle, sometimes a square or triangular course, and small then bigger ellipses, but always clockwise.  We could see no beams coming from the ground either, and the light seemed to be radiating parallel to the ground from an invisible object.  (It seems to beam out some at the right and left sides of the circumference, the course being mostly elliptical.)  It is now after 4:00 am 11/27, and the light is still there circling.   Last I checked I saw other light trailing it.  It was breaking in two at the middle of the course (bottom of ellipse) and then the smaller light followed it to the left and upward.  Kind of like the Atari game ""Breakout"" where it is guided.  Does that make sense?  It moved slow then fast like that.  And, the main light surged, too.  Like I said, it seemed to radiate from a center point above the clouds.   I also saw the light skip and appear further along the circumference immediately several times!  The light is not circular, but hazy (even inbetween the clouds where it is clear sky) and shapeless.  Not like any spotlight I’ve ever seen, and it’s in the middle of the night and has been going on for five hours.  Also, it held it’s position when we went to the front of the house, seemed to be circling over us at the same place as in the backyard.  So, it must have been pretty far away and high up over the clouds.   I hope this makes sense; I’ve tried to give as accurate of a description as possible.  I tried to capture it on camera, but it was too dark to pick anything up (maybe I just don't know how to use the thing!)",2007-02-01T00:00:00,32.9089969183359,-96.62589799691834

My immediate thought was a meteor (I've seen meteors before) when all of a sudden it made an abrupt change of direction from left to right. That's when I noticed the second object, which seemed to be wavering in one position, the light pattern was the same on this object. The first object came within close proximity of the second object and stopped, then the first object started to move at a rapid speed straight up, then stop and move down towards the horizon very rapidly, almost like a figure 4, again it raised up, at an angle, and stopped. The other object did not move. At this time I noticed a prop driven aircraft approaching from the north, I could hear the sound of the engine in the distance and recognized the red flashing safety lights (Felts Field Aviation is just 2 miles from where I live and this sighting took place so I see aircraft on a regular basis.) As the aircraft got closer to the objects the first object that had been moving across the sky suddenly dropped to the horizon and I lost sight of it, I have to say I lost track of the second object since all of my attention was affixed on the first one that was doing all the strange maneuvers. I quickly ran in the house to call my girlfriend and brother to come and look, my girlfriend came out and witnessed the last of the event.

I first spotted a very faint amber object about 150 feet in the night sky above Waller Creek running alongside San Jacinto St in front of the UT Art Building.  At first I thought it was a balloon or parachute floating, but as I observed it more intently, it was more of a dim, amber/golden glow, roughly trapezoidal, but it was more amorphous and had no hard edges.  I had dark shades running through it, as if something were inside it, or possibly surrounding the glow--it was hard to tell.  I tracked it visually as it flew silently, north over Waller Creek at a steady, slow pace maintaining the same altitude.  I then noticed that below the amber object were two very dim points of light similar to stars that were moving with it.  The points of light were at odd angles from the amber glow and their distance from each other formed an uneven triangle.  All three lights moved together and stayed in the same triangular formation.  My eyes were transfixed as I tried to determine what it could have been.  Being an artist with excellent observational skills, I flipped through every possible explanation in my head: It didn’t even remotely resemble a plane. The moon and stars don’t fly along. The objects were not solid like a balloon, parachute, weather balloon, or any other aircraft.  Also, the amorphous quality of the amber glow and the dimness of the two moving star-like objects just didn’t make sense to me, compared with regular airplanes I’ve seen hundreds of times before.  Something was just not right about this thing.  I thought about running to keep up with it, but I was exhausted from having just run 4 miles at the track, and I think it was traveling too fast to follow on foot, though a car could have kept up with it easily.  As the objects moved farther away, my bus showed up and I had to leave.  When I got on the bus and looked around at people, I had a heightened sense of awareness of my surroundings, particularly my visual and olfactory senses--lights were much more intense than usual and I was acutely aware of everyone’s movements and of the faintest smells around me.  For the rest of the night I couldn’t stop thinking about the UAP.  I kept thinking about what normal object would match what I had seen earlier, but there were none.  I know what I saw and it was anything but normal.  I’m very reluctant to mention this to anyone, but I thought it important to at least report what I witnessed.",2007-02-24T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

I was finishing a smoke outside, looking at the Big Dipper, when I noticed a movement appear out of nowhere near the constellation.  I focussed on it and saw what looked like lights in the form of a triangle.  There were maybe 12-15 lights total.  They appeared to be a purer white color than the yellow hue of the stars.  They almost looked like a flock of birds flying in formation but steadily all together so I assumed that these lights came from one object.  If it were next to the full moon, it would be about 75% of its size.  The UFO flew for 30 seconds at about a 45-degree angle from my view before disappearing into the sky, traveling from South to North ascending at a very smooth and rapid speed without making a sound.  I live near the San Francisco International Airport and have seen numerous airplanes in various stages of flight and also during take-off and landing throughout the day and into the night.

While travelling home from grocery shopping with my girlfriend, I happened to look up into the partly-cloudy sky as something caught my eye.  At first, I thought it was the moon, showing through the clouds, but as you know, when driving, the moon doesn't appear to 'move' noticeably unless you turn your car or the like. It was then that I looked more closely and saw what appeared to be a tight cluster of objects.  It was dark and while they did not appear to be glowing, they were ever so much lighter than the sky or clouds behind them.  My girlfriend was driving so I asked her to stop the car.  We pulled over and got out of the vehicle. She was the first one to see the second cluster. This second grouping was not so 'tight-knit' as the first. I was easy to dismiss the whole event as escaped balloons at first....especially with the first group being so close together. But, with their altitude, it was plain to see these two clusters were much too far apart to be simultaneous balloon releases. We noticed that we could make out individual 'units' in the second cluster which moved almost like fish in the water. There appeared to be 30 or more in this cluster alone. Not pushed about on the wind like floating balloons, and certainly not with the flapping motion of a bird, the movement of each unit was fluid with definite acceleration by some to keep the group together. Birds such as geese, flying in a V formation, do not circle for a better position within their group, as we witnessed that night. I've never believed in aliens, flying saucers or the like, but I was hoping someone has more information on what these objects could more logically be.

It moved steadily across the sky, directly overhead, and moved behind some high, very thin clouds. At this point, it disappeared.  I stepped out into the front yard to scan the sky in the direction it was travelling.  It never reappeared! It travelled about the speed of a low-altitude plane, but was as high in the sky as a jetliner.   The light was brighter than a jet would be. Strange!   I have been a field investigator for 18 years.

As the plane taxied by us (we were NO more than 100 feet from the! plane which was slightly above us at an angle moving towards the main compound) my companions vehicle, lost all power, all gauges went dead, power steering, engine, everything and we guilded to a stop.  We both existed the vehicle thinking something mechanically major had gone wrong with his vehicle.   At that moment the plane began to slowly pass us as it was taxing from the main runway.  I picked up my cell phone to call a mechanic and found my cell phone to be dead.  My companions cell phone was also dead.  We both watched the plane as it went by us.  Both of us are veterans and have travelled MANY times on 727's.   Almost at the same moment, we both spoke because we noticed that the plane had NO MARKINGS OF ANY KIND...no tail numbers, nothing.  The plane had a strange finish and almost looked (excuse the obvious pun) whitewashed.   When the plane got approximately 100 feet FROM us, my companions car RESTARTED with no apparent reason, or damage of any kind.   In addition, both my and my companions cell phone came back on.   We are both academic professors and are empiricists.  We have NEVER been involved in ANY such thing before.   I immediatally attempted to call the airport to inquire about the plane. I was connected (I dont know why to this number) the fire/police crash station.  I started to ask the man who answered about the plane.     He ruded cut me off and stated, ""that is a private plane, thank you"" and hung up.   Approximately 30 minutes later I arrived home and I decided to try and call the local aviation company which sells fuel and such and is next to the main terminal.   I called CSG Aviation.  I young woman answered and I inquired about the plane.  She was obviously very young and most likely, simple desk help.  I asked about the 727 ""private plane"" at which time she CORRECTED ME and told me ""Oh no, that was a GOVERNMENT PLANE""  I asked how she knew that and she said that ""It had picked up SOMETHING which it loaded into its rear section and it also refueled, a man in a coat and tie came from the plane and PAID for the fuel with a credit card which had US Treasury and an account number on it.""  She said thats how she knew it was a ""government plane"".   An additional call to the Airport admin office confused me further.  At that time I was now told that, "" I was mistaken, that NO PLANE, much less a 727, had landed or taken off during the time period I gave"".   When my wife got home, I told her of my encounter and SHE INFORMED ME about the ""crash"" the say before.   I had not been feeling well and  had not read the paper or seen the news.   Needless to say, this revelation absoluted stunned me.   I am trying to get the ""witnesses statements"" from the police.  I FIRMLY believe that SOMETHING WAS FOUND AND RECOVERED and that it was taken from Columbus the next day in the STRANGE and unexplained ""ghost plane"" my friend and I saw.   We have a huge military base here with its own airport.  Logic states that if this was something military, they would of taken it to Fort Benning.   I was also told that during the same period that ""debris"" was reported striking areas around Montgomery, Alabama which is appoximately 100 miles from here.   I have NEVER been involved or even interested in anything like this but circumstances has changed that.

The Object was spotted at 5:00 in the morning from our bedroom window (sliding glass door) when I woke-up and noticed the object was 1st Stationary, 2nd began to slowly descend STRAIGHT DOWN.  I could not longer see it as our Tall backyard Trees caused me to loose view of the Object.  At that moment I noticed the neighbors backyard lights start to FLICKER OFF AND ON.  Then I ran down the hall to the Kitchen to see if I could get a view of the object.  But it was not in view any longer.  However, at that moment I also noticed the other neighbors home from our Kitchen View Window their lights began to FLICKER OFF AND ON.   (Then later that same day the town experianced an unusual type of EARTHQUAKE)as noted in the below article in the newspaper.  Yes, this area is prone to Earthquakes but this one was UN-USUAL than all the others as indicated clearly im the article you can read.  At one time SETI wanted to put their Scientific Instruments near the Pinnacle National Monument area. SETI trys to make other planetary contact with other planets.  What is odd is that their was reports of local boys in the Pinnacles area that even reported seeing UFOS in that area.  And as for me this is the 4th Object I have witnessed over the years in this same area in the same location more or less.  I have even seen them when we lived on an old Ranch in a secluded area. Hollister Free-Lance Newspaper Small Quake Rattles Hollister-  Thursday, November 30, 2006 Hollister - Hollister residents received a jolt Wednesday afternoon when a mostly harmless 4.0 earthquake struck the county, followed by two smaller quakes. ""Of course, in San Benito County you get so many earthquakes,"" said Steve Walter, a seismologist with the United States Geological Survey. ""But this one was a little unusual.""  The quake struck at 1:20pm, with its epicenter located near the intersection of Freitas and Mitchell roads, roughly three miles west of Hollister and five miles east of San Juan Bautista. It was ranked as a 4.0 or ""light"" earthquake on the Richter scale, with a 1.0 being a microquake and a 10 being a quake of awesome force. The quake originated 1.9 miles below the surface of the earth.  This was followed by a microquake ranking 2.8 at 1:38pm. A third, even smaller microquake may have occurred afterward but was not confirmed by the USGS by press time.  Neither the Hollister Police Department or San Benito County Sheriff's Department received any calls reporting damage.  The quake was unusual for two reasons, said. San Benito County quakes most often originate from the San Andreas Fault area, or the Calaveras Fault. This one took place from a point between the two and cannot be confirmed to have originated from either.   It was the first 4.0 or greater quake to have occurred in the area between the faults since at least 2000, according to the USGS.  Also, most local earthquakes are characterized by horizontal motion, as the earth's plates move past one another. This quake, however, moved in a vertical fashion.  ""There were elements of horizontal motion, but most of it was vertical, and that's rare (in the area),"" said.  The quake could have been felt as far north as Pleasanton and as far south as Monterey, said. One quake report on the USGS Web site came from San Diego, but said it was highly unlikely.  ""Sometimes people hear there was an earthquake and think, 'Oh, that was what I felt,'"" he said. ""When usually it's just something like a truck going by.""",2006-12-07T00:00:00,36.8952,-121.2434

There were no coloured flashing lights (as on a plane) & it seemed to be moving too fast for either a satellite or a plane;  it was nowhere near the normal flight path to the airport.

It was a clear night so I was watching the sky for shooting stars and satellites.  It was at this Time that some strange lights appeared in the north east sky. The lights were a golden orange color and very bright. The first light appeared and steadily got brighter, and then it just went out. Immediately after, the next light came on just to the left of where the 1st one  was. It did the same thing as the 1st. When the 2 nd  light went out the 3rd came on just to the left of it until it reached its brightest point and it went out. The timing of the 3 lights were in perfect sequence, one  would appear dim then brighten and go out, then the next light came on brightened and went out, and then the third did the same.  The whole event took maybe 5- 10 seconds. The lights made NO Noise.  I could not tell if the lights were separate craft flying in a tight formation, or if the lights were coming on and going off along the side of a single craft. The lights were not far above the horizon and in the airspace between Fostoria Mi. and Clifford Mi.  I knew that the lights were not normal air traffic so I continued to watch the sky. I saw commercial air traffic above my home (Flint/Saginaw Airports). But at 10:50 pm (30 minutes after sighting) off to the north west I could see 2 aircraft flying in obvious formation heading right toward my home. As they approached, you could tell it was military fighter jets. When the fighters were getting very close to the area of the sighting the turned off the blinking lights and even kicked in afterburners. The fighters were flying at a pretty low altitude ( about 1/3 as high as commercial flights) and you could see the bright white afterburner flames. We do not get much military air traffic in the area. But when we do, they are never that low  and never have the afterburner flames shooting out. The ones this night were low, fast and loud enough to rattle the deck I was standing on. These fighters passed just between my home and where I had seen the strange lights.  I am not sure what the golden orange lights in the sky were, but I know that the military flying by was a direct result of the sighting.  I am a 41 year old male. I manage an office, and have a wife and 2 children. I know what various aircraft look like and spend a lot of time sky watching. I know what satellites look like as the move across the sky.

PD)) Dear Sir,   I have always heard that UFO sightings date back to the end of WWII, but I know about one that was witnessed by my own grandfather and 9-year-old uncle in 1942. The place was Montagny, a small village in the centre of France.  Time of the year:  Autumn, the day before the Allies landed in North Africa. It happened at night.  My grandfather and uncle had gone out to a farm to buy potatoes, in spite of the curfew, imposed by occupying Germany. They were in a hollow ((empty??)) lane, in the dark, when suddenly a thing, saucer-shaped, with a ""window-like in a train compartment, started next to them from behind a hedge. The thing hovered there for a moment, then went away at a tremendous speed, without making any noise.  Planes were so noisy then that they made the ground shake, when there were a lot of them at a time. You can imagine their fright!  My grandfather died in 1975, but he still trembled and shook when he told that story.  My uncle died a year ago, and he hated talking about it. It is absolutely out of the question that my grandfather invented that story.  Also, he told the family immediately, well before people started talking of U.F.O.’s. He told the story to a distant cousin, who had been a colonel in the French army, but apart from that, the story has never been outside the family.  My grandfather would not have like any publicity about it. As he said, it could not be something immaterial because it made some dead leaves swirl on the ground. It could not be a hallucination because they both saw the same thing. Was it something human-made?... a German spy plane, or something like that?  Maybe, but I have yet to see a saucer-like plane that moves without making a noise. So, what was it?  If you know, I’d be glad to know, too. I don’t think many people saw that thing, because there weren’t many people wandering outside at night in Nazi-occupied France in 1942!  (But if you heard about similar sightings, I’d like to know, too)   Yours Sincerely,   ((name deleted))",,,

There were other stars in the sky that night, but with the thin layer of high cirrus cloud over our area, the stars all seemed to be not as bright as usual, and that is why I found the brightness of the “object” strange and a little odd.

I called him to the window and asked him if he could see those lights. I asked him if it could be the sun reflecting off something, and what he thought they were.  He replied it was something in the woods, but he didn’t have a clue what it could be. I grabbed my digital camera and tried to take a picture, but could not get a good shot from where I was.  He told me to give him the camera.  He went outside and climbed up on a ledge beside the porch and took 2 pictures, then the camera went dead.  We talked about the lights for a few minutes., and then he went back to getting ready for work. I set the camera on the table, and started making breakfast. He ate and left for work.

As I played the video from the beginning frame by frame, I noticed a single dot entering the frame converging with the second jet. In the next frame it appeared to go through the fighter jet forming black dots in the next frame above and below the jet, in the next frame three black dots appear  perfectly triangulating in close proximity around the jet.

I looked up into the clear blue sky and saw a very bright orb, approx the size of a pea held at arm’s length.  The object appeared to be a few miles away depending on the size of the object.  The light being emitted was brighter than anything I have ever seen- somewhat like a flashbulb that was on continually.  After a few seconds, the color shifted to a dark charcoal black with a halo ring around the perimeter.  The black was unlike anything I can describe.  Much darker than black itself…. Very unusual. The object moved slowly from West to East in the sky and kept switching from black to very bright.  I noticed a group of three men standing nearby and asked them what they thought it could be.  One replied ""that’s a balloon,"" and they went on talking and ignoring the object.   The orb began to move up into the heavens and get smaller.  By the time my ride arrived, I could still see it at a great distance but I could only see when it was bright, not black.  This was no balloon, not a military aircraft that I could identify (McCord AFB is nearby).  It certainly was not a helicopter or plane.  It is very difficult to describe the intensity and nature of the bright glow and the charcoal black.  I am certain that this was an unusual object that cannot be identified by any means of conventional wisdom, making it a UFO.",2007-08-14T00:00:00,47.21257223776224,-122.4597204895105

Before you think that it may have been a meteor, it had no trails after it and was not moving like a meteor would.  I was looking about the sky and at the stars when it looked as though one of the stars was moving.

Aircraft fly over my house and I no what they look and sound like, and the thing that I saw in the sky was nothing I had seen before.  It had no flashing lights that come from a helicopter of plane and there was no noise, plus it was too far up in the sky for any plane or helicopter to fly.  I followed it with my binoculars for about 35 seconds as it flew at a calm, steady speed in a straight line and lost visibility as it flew out of sight over the other houses.   After about ten minutes I was looking about the sky through my binoculars when I saw something else move in the way I had saw the first object move.  This one was a slightly different shape and duller than the first and looked to be higher in the sky.  As it flew in the opposite direction to the first object,  it appeared to meet with another shape and this one also moved but this may have been due to me moving so I just discarded the third one as nothing.  The second object I saw moving was more of a longer shape like a rounded off cigar shaped object.  It was duller than the first object I saw and was hard to see as it was so high up, even in the binoculars. I followed this one for about ten seconds before I lost sight of it.

We both agreed that the object was at the 10,000 to 20,000 ft range and as for the speed, we've observed satellites in the past and it was moving at least 4 times the speed.  It didn't seem to fade the further it got away. No flashing lights, though there was air traffic in the air at the time, commercial jets. I live 1 hour from the airport, so that would put the traffic at about 10,000ft or so.  It seemed to be at this level or higher.   This was my first sighting, and would like to see it again.

I had never been to Cancun and looking at the sky between sets of a card game; the stars were more clearly visible than in Seattle, where I live. After a few minutes of looking at the stars, I observed what appeared to be a medium-bright star moving in a nearly due north direction. The object moved at the same speed and at first I assumed it was a satellite or a plane, perhaps. Then, it abruptly changed course (without stopping) approximately 120 degrees to a southeast direction. It then began to make erratic, darting sort of movements, accelerating and slowing, moving in different directions within a relatively small area of the sky, before appearing to come to a complete stop. A couple of seconds later, it vanished. This entire episode lasted approximately 20-30 seconds. I did not lose sight of the object until it disappeared. There was one witness, a friend of mine on the deck with me. Two other friends on the deck did not see this phenomena in time before it disappeared. They could not pick out what I was pointing at. I alerted my friends to the phenomena when I saw the initial 120 degree turn, as it was an extraordinary movement of an object in the sky. It was easy to discern the motion of the object, as there were palm leaves just below my point of reference, so I had a clear definition of the object's path relative to my surroundings. It was perfectly easy to track the flight path of the object, there were no obstructions and I did not lose sight of it during the sighting.  The sky was clear, with few if any clouds. Other stars were visible in the vicinity, none were moving. If it had been a mylar balloon, as was suggested, caught in the breeze, it would have likely changed the intensity of light reflection as it moved, but this was a solid unblinking light, exactly like a medium-intensity star. A balloon would not have moved in such a perfectly straight course for the 8-10 seconds I saw it before the initial course change. There were other stars of that intensity out that night; it was easy to compare its brightness to other objects in the sky. It was not as bright as Venus or as dim as a star you'd have to squint to see.  At first, my friend thought it was a satellite because of the brightness, until its movements were clearly not that of a satellite. It left no trail as a meteor would; I sometimes sit out and watch the Perseid Meteor Shower when it occurs in the summer and am familiar with what a ""shooting star"" looks like. I have seen satellites pass overhead and the luminosity was comparable to a satellite or a medium-bright star.  Venus was visible that night to the west, nowhere near the flight of this object. Mars was also visible; it was neither of these planets.  We watched the skies for about twenty more minutes, and did not see anything like this again. There were no apparent laser light shows in Cancun, as anything of a promotional nature would have likely been repeated in the time we watched the skies after the initial sighting.  We were sober and alert when we witnessed this object. My eyesight is 20/20 corrected with glasses, which I was wearing at the time.  I work in engineering for a large telecommunications company, and my friend who witnessed it is also a professional employed in project management. The two others who did not see it are a CEO of a financial institution and an automotive project manager.  I do not consider myself a UFO buff, or a believer for that matter. But what I saw, a star or object that made an approximately 120 degree shift in course instantaneously without stopping, quite frankly, startled me.  I feel a little embarrassed telling people what I saw, because I have received a bit of ridicule already by telling a story like this. I am not claiming to have seen a UFO, I did see something exhibit motion not possible by our understanding of physics. I don't know what it was, but it was not a plane, a meteor, a bird, a balloon, a star, a satellite or a reflection of anything. The sky was clear all around our area.  I am also not known as a storyteller, someone who seeks attention. I wasn't looking for a story, I was enjoying the stars. Until I saw this phenomena. I don’t know what it was.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,,

The persons who first noticed the ufo's were looking at the western sky trying to watch the meteor showers.  When they looked up they noticed what appeared to be stars, yet these were not on any map that we had ever seen.  These ""stars"" had intense flashes of yellow green red and blue, and seemed to be stationary at the time.  Three of us saw blue lights shooting from one ""star"" to the other.  Upon further monitoring with binoculars we discovered that the stars were infact moving at rapid speeds, faster then any plane that any of the nine people had ever seen.  Also these ""stars"" looked like round disks through the binoculars. Once looking through the binoculars an older member of our group estimated the disks to be around 15 miles away. The disks themselves were a gray or silver color.  After about 30 minutes of looking to the western sky we noticed that there were more of these disks above us and to the east, in all totaling around 8 disks.   About an hour later the disks then began to move to the east.  What was also strange was that even though these objects were moving we heard no sound.  Also through the entire event we did not see any planes. I mention this because we usually see planes headed to Lambert International Airport in Saint Louis.  One of us called a relative who lives in Saint Louis and asked if they could see the disks and he confirmed seeing the same thing.   All in all we are a family who loves nature and star gazes often.  Some of us are extremly well educated and some of us know alot about the planets and stars.  By far this was the strangest thing anyone of us had ever seen.

At approximately 11:10 pm on 5/8/06, I had just arrived at work.  I heard my fellow employees calling for another employee to come outside to see something.  A few minutes later, another employee came in and asked if me and a few others if we wanted to see a ""blimp.""   We walked outside, and approximately 500 feet in front of me, and approximately 500-1000 feet in the air (about the height of an average radio tower), we saw three lights in a triangular formation (one green light on top, two white lights below).  On of the lights might have been flashing slowly.  There was no silouette or object that we could make out for them to be connected to, it was as black as the night sky.  Below, but from our view unconnected to the lights, was a flat, bottomside of a rectangle, which was not necessarily illuminated, but had a grayish tint to it (like it was reflecting the moon, kind of thing), and it didn't appear to be connected to anything.  The object was motionless.  We watched it for approximately 10 minutes without it moving, and the night was silent.  It seemed that the employees who had called it a ""blimp"" were assuming that's what it was because there was no solid shape, outline, or reflection (other than the previously mentioned rectangle) to be seen.  It did NOT look like a blimp. I went back inside to call my husband who was working at another worksite about 1.5-2 miles north and east of me, and asked him if he could see anything.  He informed me that others were already going outside to look at something, and that he would go check as soon as he could.  He was unable to go out for apprx. 30 minutes, but when he did, was able to see a ""side"" view of lights.  I assumed what I was seeing was a ""rear"" view because when I went back outside to check on it around midnight, it was about 1000 feet away instead of 500 feet. I was able to find a website that had blimp schedules for 2006, and there were no scheduled blimp flights in our area for May at all, as they were all in the South for golf tournaments and the Kentucky Derby.  There was no sound or motion to indicate a jet or helicopter.   Having grown up on a Navy base in S. California, I am quite familiar with all kinds of aircraft, and the sounds that they make...even the Stealth fighters and bombers make some noise.  This object made no noise, had little to no movement, and had no form.   Those of us who observed this object at my workplace had mixed opinions as to what this object was, ranging from a military experiment to UFO's, but we were all clear that the object was NOT a blimp.  I did not see it leave, although an employee that works with my husband reported seeing it, looking away for a moment, then looking back at it, and it was missing from the sky.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,40.47267919621749,-88.95847375886524

About 11:45 pm, I was able to leave my station and view the object.  What I saw is as follows:  I saw what appeared to be a configuration of lights that you would commonly find on a commercial passenger jet.  A vague light at the front, much like an illuminated cockpit.  A white strobe light underneath was pulsing.  At what I considered to be the rear, a slightly larger constant light, not very bright, was the color of a slightly yellow moon.   Although there was nothing spectacular about what I was seeing, the most remarkable aspect of this sighting is that there was absolutely no motion or noise.  The object did not appear to hover because this would infer that it was making adjustments in horizontal and vertical attitude.  This object seemed to be set in the sky much the same as any radio tower or water tower light that you might observe.  But, as my collegues and I were aware, there was absolutely no tower or fixed light in that area.   Between my colleagues and me, we viewed this object for about an hour and ten minutes.   When the first person at my site had to leave to go home, they saw the object as they were driving away, they looked down at the road, and looked back towards the object again, and it had disappeared.  He then called us, we went back outside, and there was absolutely nothing in the sky.   The next morning, I phoned a local radio program, and asked if there were any other reports of sightings.

At first i was laying on the hood of my roomates car cooling off and studying for a final.  looking at the paper while lying on my back on the hood, what seemed to be the brightest star in the sky just moved.  i was on the phone with someone and i said, ""O, my god... i swer that is a ufo.  i'll call you right back.""  i tried to get someone from my roomate and my girlfriend to come out but they just got pissed and complained about getting up early for finals.  i called my best friend who said, "" whatever, i believe you, now stop calling and let me go back to sleep.""  i called the neighbor who looked out the window and said the couldn't see anything.  well i explained that it was almost directly over the house.  about that time her baby woke up and she was fed up with that idea.  at this time i was going nuts.  i thought i was loosing it.  i was brought up in the lds religion and i have never believed in ufo's of any kind... untill i saw what i did.  i went to a friends house a few doors down and nucked and rung the door bell.  her roomate came down and i could barely get the words out.  it was baffling... i couldn't even begin to tell her what i was seeing.  so she came out and i pointed it out to her.  she saw the light, said she saw it move a little, then claimed it was a satalite.  i had to tell her what i saw.  the thing moved at incredible speeds and didn't slow to a stop, bot instantly came to a stop.  then she asked if i had smoked anything.  i realized this was going nowhere.  i let her go and tried to figure out what to do.  i tried calling my best friend again to see if i could barrow his camera because all i had was my cell phone and the video quality isn't the best.  he got mad again so i flipped.  i need someone to believe me and see what i am seeing.  i recorded almost 3 minutes of this light on my cell phone which was barely visible, but it is still there.  at this time i saw two more lights moving with every motion that the first light was.  it was definately a triangle.  i thought to call 911 and maybee get an officer out to my house to file a report or something.  as you could guess... bad idea.  the wierd thing was, i tried to dial 911, it failed?  kinda wierd.  so i tried to dial my neighbor again and then my best friend, and on top of it tried to send a text message to the person i was on the phone with to begin with.  i couldn't dial out.  i just got this phone this week.  so i run in and grab my old cell phone which still worked.  i dialed 911 and requested an officer to my house.  i had to call back again 10 minutes later to see if he was coming.  another five minutes passed and he showed up.  once again i could barely explain myself.  i paointed at it as it was moving and he wouldn't stop staring at me.  then he turned on the flashlight to my face and asked if i had consumed any lsd or if i was under the influence of anything.  at the time i wasn't (lucky me).  so he starred at it and couldn't tell if it was him moving from standing there looking almost straight up or if it was the light.  the next words out of his mouth was, ""wow. i saw a shooting star... hey, another one.  that's kinda odd.""  i looked at him like; you've got to be kidding me.  where the few shooting stars came from was exactly where i pointed to the ship.  i tried to say, they came from the ship in three different directions.  officer, you have to believe me.  i swear i am not crazy.  odly i said that line a whole lot throughout the night.  he got a call and said he had to go.  he tried to saw it was probably some airforce testing.  i could tell that he was in denial of what he had just seen.  said he had some where to be and left.  at this time it was around 2:30 am.  where does a sheriff have to be at that time, and why was he so jumpy.  none the less i was still going crazy.  no one honestly believed me.  i laid back on the hood watching the bright light almost twinkle to a red, then a green, then a blue, and then back.  all of a sudden i got this terrifying feeling throughout my body.  for some reason i was frightened.  it takes a lot to scare me, but when i was thinking why am i scared, because physically i wasn't but i had one bad feeling, i snapped to realizing that i was shaking and already starting to run towards my door.  i had to go somewhere.  i drive into city limits around 4:45 am.  there was a hince of light coming up over the palouse so i hurried into town.  the first place that i saw was conoco.  thankfully it was twenty four hours and i saw two employees inside.  the lady at the door mopping looked at me funny... probably the expression on my face.  i was hoping for someone that recognized me from shopping in there all of the time so they wouldn't be freaked out and would actually give me the time of day.  behind the counter in the back room was a newer employee that i had only seen once or twice before, but the person who had trained him the first night i saw him was a good aquantance and told him that i was a cool person and was in there all the time.  of all people, the only person that would recognize me and was around my age was him.  i tried to explain but nothing came out.  just come outside quick, and if you can think of anyone with a camcorder, call them.  he comes out of the store throwing on his jacket and i point to the sky.  he was like, what?  so i pulled him out of the front of the store to the side where there was less light and i stood close to him and pointed.  i didn't even have to say it, he said, "" wow, that bright light right there isn't it."" he knew what i was talking about.  he didn't know what i meant but looked right where i was.  i told him now watch.  give it around thirty seconds.  i saw it randomly jolt to different sides and suddenly stop.  every time i was all, you saw that right?  he really couldnt tell if it was him moving from standing up or if it was his eyes grabbing focal points or what.  so i laid on one of the tables and told him, ""please, give me two minutes of your time and just lay on that other bench at stare at it.""  he was supprisingly willing.  once again i had to state, i swear i am not crazy.  after about fifteen seconds of this thing moving around and me asking if he saw it... he took a wierd gasp of air.  the next thing i hear is, "" o my god... you arn't kidding are you.""  finally.  i pointed out that there was dimmer lights on the other two points.  he struggled but adjusted and saw them.  as we bothe watched it move and come to frantic instant stops i notince you couldn't see stars behind it.  i followed the direction from the bright light on the front to the dimmer lights that formed the triangle and there was still blackness with no stars continuing down the ray that the lead light and the dim light formed.  together we both counted between 4 and 5 lights down each side.  we watched it move and saw by the way the lights moved together that the tip (wich i designated to the bright lead light) was wobbling not only side to side, but corresponding with the other lights, up and down also.  it looked like the lead star would randomly point down, then left, then right... by now i realized that this wasn't just the bright light that i saw before.  this was an outline of some sort of craft that seemed like it was struggling to hover in one place.  by focusing on the outline of the craft and not on the lights themselves, i understood that it wasn't just darting and stopping, it was turing from side to side, from front to back trying to counter the way it would randomly move.  i had to pull out my phone.  the second phone that i grabbed would dial out, but i hit the capture video button and the screen showed a brief flashing triangle and went to static.  as i am typing this, the video or the camera will no longer work on my old phone.  so one could dial out, and one could capture video.  i grabbed my new phone out of the car wich couldn't dial, but we stood there and captured 43 seconds of the triangle moving around randomly flashing lights.  once again, bad quality, but we could make it out when we watched in the dark.  i tried watching the few videos again a little while ago, but with sunlight up now, and no dark rooms in my house i figured i'd look at it later tonight to show anybody and everybody who will give me the time of day.  with this mind boggling site over head we both laid back and watched the evasive movements.  out of the corner of my eye, the was quick movement.  there where random 'shooting stars' in the sky every couple minutes.  and then none.  as the sun started to come up to the point that you couldn't see stars, we saw that there was only a handful of lights in the sky.  the one we were watching, and now, other movements just like the one before.  we tried to count how many actual clusters of lights there where instead of trying to make out all of the individual lights.  it was amazing.  he ran into the store to grab a coat and i waited at the door, then looked at the lady who was mopping when i walked in and told her she had to see this.  we all walked outside and looked up to a hazy dark gray sky with random stars in the middle of nowhere with comparison to the other stars.  i looked to the east and saw the light blue peaking out from the rolling hills of the palouse.  ""does anyone have a good video camere?!""  no body will ever believe us.  we all laid watching the sky, with evasive manuvers from many different areas.  i saw a wierd formation with all of these.  for a couple seconds it seemed like all of those lights were one huge ship.  with the way they moved so scattered across the sky covering almost half the distance from horizon to horizon, i couldn't focus on them all at once because there was no longer an outline formed by the stars behind it.  i quickly dropped that idea when i saw the light furthest to the east move sharply towards the sunrise and stop where i could barely see it against the lighter sky.  it was wierd, there was no shape, there was no outline, just the lights that formed the triangle with the blue sky showing through as if it was only a few lights hovering there.  it sat still, darted a couple times, sat still again, and we looked away to see the other ones.  when we looked back we couldn't find it again.  now we all laid there and saw now less than 3 different triangular star cluster moving independantly.  there were random lights moving around behind these three wich were obviosly the closer ones, but we could't make out triangles.  just that main light that seemed to lead it.  we looked to the west to see if there were more, and against the western sky, wich was still dark as night, was a twinkling red light.  it went back and forth from red and yellow and white but mainly stayed a reddish twinkling color.  at first we just though it was a star, or maybe one of the nearby planets that reflects a red twinkle.  and it moved!  we watched that one now because the color on it was easy to spot and the contrast of the red on the black made it easy to depict motion.  it was very far away though and it was barely above the horizon, so we decided to lay back down on the benches.  as it got lighter, customers would come for gas or for the convienance store and on thier way out, i couldn't help it, but i got their attention and pointed to the sky which seems to come out a lot better than my words.  some people would walk over tawards me and ask what about the stars.  as it got lighter, these were the only stars in the sky.  i told many people who were curious to just watch for at least 30 seconds, that's all i ask.  a couple would say they really had to get going, but a couple of them stood there with me, watching.  costumers would leave and come and a couple would be interested but not believe or whatever they were thinking, but me and the conoco employee stayed out on those benches slowly watching the clusters dissapear into the daylight untill the only one left in the sky was the first one that we had seen.  it was geeting light comming up on 5:30-6:00 in the morning and with clear skies, there was an odd haze, or fog, or maybee a random cloud cluster.  slowly the stars forming it's shape vanished in the light, and the last light wich was the first that we saw blended in the the daylight.  it was one long night.  there are a handfull of us who can't deny what we saw, and a couple breif video clips on my phone to prove it.  i hope that in the next couple days i find of other people who saw this.  i'll tell you what, i know exactly where i will be tonight between 1 and 6.  out on the hood of the car, hoping i see them again.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,46.71884324324324,-116.9267972972973

We realized after closer observance that it was one vehicle, not two.  It was hard to make out at first, but could see it was saucer/disk shaped and at a fairly low altitude moving slowly across the sky.  We guessed it was flying about the altitude a small plane would fly in our local area so we guessed it to be about the size of a football field across.  The light to the right went out, blinked, and then came on again after a second. and then flickered on and off again.  Then it turned westward while rotating around clockwise.  It then disappeared northward as it turned counterclockwise and moved over the mountain range and disappeared from our view.

I was over a friends house and around 7:50 pm or so, I had to move my car.  Upon walking outside I looked up at the sky because I heard a jet.  When I looked up I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  There was indeed a jet at a rather high altitude, but it was flying by a very low flying black, triangular craft.  The jet was clearly audible, but the triangle made no sound, and flew way too slow for it to be a commercial jet or anything of the sort. It had a strange array of lights, that outlined the triangular shape, three big lights, two white, one red (the red was in the front).  There were more lights, dim and seemed to pulse that outlined the sides of it that confirmed to me, that it was indeed a solid triangle.  The lights also didn't seem to illuminate it, which was rather eerie.  The jet soon passed it, and there was not a sound to be heard. It at very first seemed to be heading in the direction of the airport, but after moving my car, I noticed it wasn't heading in any direction in particular.  Rather, it moved in one direction, then seemed to slowly turn, and head in the opposite direction it was originally going. Note, the entire time this happened it had moved so slow, seriously could not believe it was there, I have seen low flying planes before, and this was no way that, I live near an airport, so it's a common thing for me to see.  I tried to get my friends attention to observe it, but he was in a rush, so only I saw it.

He saw a group of lights and pointed them out to me.  They were moving slowly and low in the sky.  There were two groups of four bright white lights, in a straight line, one larger group above the other smaller group, similar to the shape of the ship on Star Trek.  The entire group slowly turned to the right, then split into two separate groups, each a group of four bright white lights with a red light underneath.  The two groups slowly passed over us and continued on toward the southeast until out of sight.  There was no noise at all, completely silent.  I am sure that it was not airplanes or a blimp.  I tried to take photographs, but wasn't sure if I was getting anything because it was so dark.  When we looked at our pictures later, I was shocked to find not only the two groups I was focusing on, but three more groups of different colors in the photo as well.  In the photo they appear zig-zagging, but they did not look like this by plain eyesight.   Witness 2 (19 y/o male):  It was around 9:00 pm, and my girlfriend and I were on the way to my house from the high school baseball game.  We were driving down the road and I noticed some strange lights in the sky.  I told her to look and she was surprised too.  There were four white lights and a red light.  The four white lights blinked in a rolling sequence and the red light did not blink at all.  I am sure they could not have been  planes because they were too close together and were moving very slowly and I could not hear anything.  They were low enough that I should have been able to hear something.  As they moved along, it seems that the red light was moving ahead of the white lights.  I have never seen anything like this.  Witness 3 (40 y/o female):  I did not witness the event first hand.  My daughter called me at approximately 9:15 pm and was very excited.  She said that her and her boyfriend were heading to his house and saw strange lights in the sky.  They had stopped and were trying to get pictures.  She was very nervous and excited and was talking to me as they passed overhead.  She said they were low down and completely silent.  I could not hear anything over the phone.  She said they had been in a large configuration, that they looked like the ship on Star Trek, then broke apart and became two separate groups, but kept moving together.  I was trying to tell her to get photographs, and she was trying, but didn't think they would turn out.  She said she couldn't see anything solid, but the lights appeared to be moving as one object.

It so happens that there was another airplane in the sky at the time and this object flew by the airplane like it was standing still.  My first thought was that maybe it was a fighter plane....but there was no sound and it was moving 2-3 times the speed of a fighter plane.  Second, I thought maybe a shooting star or meteorite.  Just as the object was disappearing into the horizon it shot straight upward.  So much for the shooting star or meteorite theory.  I have no idea what that thing was.

We pulled over because it seemed odd to us that there would be commercial airliners flying low and in a flight pattern. The presumed aircraft were directly in front of us as we were looking East at mile marker 362 on HWY 70. I had turned off my lights so we could get a better view.  As we were watching the flashing lights, again presumed aircraft, and discussing whether they were military aircraft and were they practicing flying, just slightly to the North-east and out of nowhere we visualized six bright lights, not quite orange and not quite white in color, appear tilted and low to the ground. Four of lights remained almost steady for a couple of seconds then in succession, two more lights came on which allowed us to see the spherical shape and a 30 degree angle on the craft (above the lights). They disappeared one after the other, again giving us a visual of a sphere. Immediately I asked my brother if he just saw the same thing and he replied yes. It was so close (compared to the flashing lights we were originally attracted to) that the hair all over my body stood straight up and my heart starting pounding. I was fumbling for my cell camera and continue looking in the direction we saw the lights, when I saw four of the lights again a little higher, a little more north and in succession…ie first light flowed to the second, again giving off a perception that the craft was spherical. I was unable to capture a picture in time. So, as I was again fumbling (shaking) with my camera phone when we both saw the lights directly north of us and further away, this time there were 5 lights that followed in succession. Unable to capture an image as it was too far for a camera phone. Immediately after we saw the 3rd sighting, we noticed the flashing lights come out of formation and zigzag in front of us, still what appeared to be higher than the spherical craft. After about a minute of this, we saw the four flashing light craft take off quickly towards the south and seconds later heard the deafening roar of what sounded like jets. We waited for another 5 minutes to see if anything else would reappear, however, nothing else showed. During the few minutes we saw the 3 sightings, we were the only ones on that section of highway, however, shortly after the jets left there were 3 other cars that passed us (on e going east, the other two west).  I have never seen anything that seemed so odd. Also, we had the windows down after the 1st sighting, but never heard any noise until after we saw the 4 craft leave.  I am a higher education graduate with a prominent career in the healthcare field. My brother works in customer service.

I immediately noticed how close it was and how it seemed to be changing colors. I immediately grabbed my binoculars and viewed the object slowly moving in the sky. While viewing this sky anomaly, I noticed out of the corner of my eye another object like it but at a slightly further distance. After about 30 minutes, the 2nd object had completely vanished while the seemingly closer object remained in the sky for another 30 minutes (1 hour total) before slowly disappearing from my view. The object seemed to transition from a white color to a reddish-orange color and then to a bright blue. There were no blinking lights on the object but rather the entire circular shaped anomaly seemed to pulsate its colors. This is not the first time I have viewed something peculiar in the sky. About 3 months ago, I also viewed 2 red orbs floating above an apartment complex for about 15 minutes very close to each other. They both moved erratically like a bee buzzing around in the sky (no sound and very unlike the normal movement of an airplane or helicopter).

The sky was bright blue, with strong, gusty winds blowing from the northeast. I paused on a bluff that overlooks the Santa Ana riverbed to look at the scenery. I noticed a bright object in the sky to the west. I first thought it was a mylar balloon being blown by the wind, however I quickly noticed that it was not moving nearly as fast as, or in the same direction as the wind. Its path through the sky was quite smooth, not like it was being tossed about by the wind. The object was oval and was changing color every few seconds from reddish orange to white. It seemed to me that the object was slowing turning or wobbling, alternately showing a red and white surface. The object was bright, but not glittery as a metallic balloon would appear reflecting sunlight. I watched the object for about 5 minutes as it slowly made an arc towards the southeast. It finally hovered in one spot in the sky. I continued to watch it for another 20 minutes or so, and apparently it was gaining in altitude. When I first saw it, it had a definite oval shape and seemed to be about the same altitude as some general aviation type aircraft that were flying in the vicinity. After watching it hover, the size gradually reduced to where it looked like a star visible in the daytime. After watching the object for almost a half an hour, I started to walk home, stopping every so often to see if the object was still there. I hoped to locate it once I got home, where I could use binoculars to look at it, however the road took a turn through tall trees, and I was unable to find it again. It continued the flashing effect for the entire duration. There were numerous jet and propeller driven aircraft seen in the sky during the time of the sighting. I would assume it was a balloon of some type if it were not for the fact it was unaffected by the strong winds.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,33.93964338565022,-117.4001158071749

It began at 7:35 PM and lasted until 8:25 PM involving 4 separate objects, each seen at different times during the 50 minute duration.  The first object was seen at 7:35 PM as I was leaving for a security patrol. The object was seen by me and my co-worker, then later only by me.  The first object came from the south west and moved to the north east. This object was a white ball of light. It stopped 2 times completely, then continued across the sky very slowly.  There was a discernable darkness around the object. Though it did not pass over any major stars, there seemed to be a solid object and not just a light.  An airplane (a regular commercial airliner), about 3-4 minutes into this, came from the north west. Within 30 seconds of the airplane appearing, the light we had been following simply vanished.  I then went on my security patrol. About 5 minutes into the patrol, directly overhead, a small light appeared. It then began to grow in intensity and travel in a southerly direction, reaching a -2 or -3 magnitude, not quite the brightness of Venus.  At 8 PM, I reached about the midpoint in my security round. I saw another light, this time very dim, moving from south east to the north east, crossing through the constellation of Pegasus.  At 8:10 PM, I went to the same spot where the other security guard had seen a triangular UFO fly over him two nights before.  I saw nothing at this point, and left to continue my round.  A light caught my eye in the mountains to the north east. A very bright light near the top of the mountain range.  I went back to my previous position to get a better look. I am very familiar with this mountain range, even in the dark. More pointedly, the stars rise over this mountain range, giving a clear outline of mountains themselves.  If Venus is normally a magnitude of -4 to -5, this was a magnitude of -7 at least. This light/object moved up and down from the top of the mountains, into the sky about a degree or two.  It also moved side to side and two times, and twice increased in brightest and moved in such a way that I felt that it was approaching, however, it never did move overhead.  After calling the other guard about this object, and asking him to come out, it faded to the same magnitude of the star I was watching rise over the hill to its left. It then increased in magnitude and then vanished.  This is similar to another sighting I had on September 29th on an adjacent mountain range.  I was able to rule out a motorcycle or car headlight in that the light/object clearly moved above the horizon, something a normal vehicle could not do.  Once the other guard arrived, he noticed an aberration in the night sky. He pointed to it, and I saw it as well. 2 objects flying low in the sky. One that seemed to be darker than the night sky, traversing over the background stars and another ""ghostly"" object behind it that also obscured the stars in the background.  These objects came from the areas where the bright light had been and traveled beneath the constellation Pegasus in a north to east trajectory.  Not feeling comfortable about being in that location any longer, we then headed back to our office to complete the patrol.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,39.965789473684204,-120.99926842105263

This is a daily ritual for me on the weekdays before I start work in the area.  The sun had risen, and there were a few light clouds.  There was no wind.  The area is in the flight path of jets landing at Orlando International Airport, which is approximately 10 miles to the south.  I was staring out over the lake when I looked up and noticed a black form flying towards the lake from the west.  At first I thought it was a large bird such as a vulture or eagle circling over the lake.  The object was dark, big, silent, and was not traveling at a high rate of speed.  As I examined it more closely, I could see that it was not a bird.  The object descended, and for a moment, I thought it could be someone parachuting into town, but I didn't see any evidence of a person beneath the object.  It stopped descending and began to slowly fly to the northeast, towards the Casselberry area.  Despite the object being very dark, the rear of the object reflected in the newly risen sun as it flew out of sight.  There are some cypress trees by the lake, which obscured my view of the object as it flew away.  When it was shining in the sun, it appeared to be spherical - I'm not sure if the object actually changed shape as I watched it, or if I had misjudged its shape when I first noticed it.  A few strange things about the object:  It seemed to be flying low.  It was difficult to determine its exact shape.  It was completely silent.  It seemed big, but I was unable to determine its size without a nearby sufficient frame of reference.  The moon was still visible in the sky - if I had to compare it to the moon, I'd say that it wasn't big enough to have obscured the moon had it flown over it.  Also, it seemed to appear from the west - it was just there over the lake somewhat suddenly, but it's possible that nearby trees obscured it from my view.  My only thoughts on what it might have been is a balloon, but not a hot-air balloon.  It seemed to be following a definite flight path - not randomly being carried by air currents and ascending and descending.  Also, the shape seemed to be off.

It is far more vivid than a typical ""twinkling"" star, especially considering that I can see it through the light pollution of the city (Chicago).

This occurred to me to be unusual and I continued to look at the object thinking at first that it might be some type of comet, or a really slow shooting star trailing debris.  It looked like some points in the string were brighter than other points.  As I continued to observe the object for several minutes it changed shape and appeared to condense into a sphere shape.  I am unsure if it was a single object or several smaller objects.  There was a very bright star in the background, and a tree in the foreground.  I noticed the object moving  from side to side (in an east west manner) relative to both of these objects.  I do not recall it moving above the star though.  I walked south a bit more to get out of the lights of my complex and try to get a better look, by that time the object was smaller and dimmer and I can’t be certain if it was my eyes playing tricks on me or not, but it looked like the object (it looked singular at this point) had dimmed and was moving back and forth in a very small area very rapidly.  It was at this point I discontinued my observation after several minutes had passed.  The object, in addition to changing direction several times, appeared to brighten and dim several times.  If I had to draw my own conclusion I would say it was some type of balloon, or a group of balloons strung together that was released from the ground.  Why someone would release balloons at 9pm I cannot say, but that still doesn’t explain why it initially appeared so bright.  reflection from the lights below can only explain so much and at this time of evening it is pretty dark outside and the lights of La Mesa not that bright unless they were all foil type balloons.  My other thought is that the bright star I observed may have been a satellite, and it could have been damaged and trailing debris in the atmosphere, I am uncertain and I have reported the incident as best I could.

No sound at all. I wasn't going to report this until I saw that someone else from this exact same city experienced something similar just two months ago. So, I decided to also write a report since there must obviously be something going on here that is unexplained and I would like answers.  Earlier this morning (Sunday Jan. 20th, 2008) at approximately 5:58 AM I decided to look out of my front door to see if the ground was covered with ice (we had a lot of rain last evening and freezing temperatures overnight), and as I was looking out the front door I noticed something completely strange to my left. It was floating above the tree line across from a field approximately 1/2 mile from my front door. The lights were pulsating from red to orange (similar to flames from a forest fire) as this thing or craft was slowly receding behind the tree line behing the open field.  It seemed to have three large lights from the side I was seeing. And judging from the neighbors house down the road and the distance this craft was from their home and ours, it had to be atleast the size 4 or 5 homes combined, possibly even larger. A truly amazing site and a camera was the last thing on my mind.  Anyway, I couldn't believe what I was seeing, so I went to wake my wife up to verify what I was seeing. She quickly awoke when I told her that she had to see something that was going to blow her mind. I was hoping this thing wouldn't be gone before we made it back to the front door. When we both got to the front door it was still there and was now half way down behind the tree line. My wife said "" oh my God, what is that?"". We both looked at it in awe as it descended behind the trees and seemed to have landed. The area it seemed to have landed in is near a creek in a swampy area. In a place people wouldn't normally go or have good access to. All I could think is why would someone or something be landing there.  My wife and I stared in the direction for nearly an hour to see if it was going to fly away. She described it as being similar to the sun going down behind the trees due to the brightness it displayed and the red and orange colors, But this definitely wasn't the sun, it was only 5:58 AM and was in the north west during the dark of night. She was only able to see the top half of the object and the lights as it was already landing as I awoke her. We both couldn't believe what we had just seen. This definitely was like nothing I had ever seen, especially this close to our own home. I must mention that I am prior military (U.S. Army Veteran) and I am very observant and have an IQ of 138. This definitely didn't seem like any modern day aircraft that our military would have and even if it were, why would they land in the middle of the swampy creek area here at 5:58 AM on a Sunday morning?  As far as the shape of the craft, it seemed to be an oval shape and had no sound at all as we stepped out of the front door to listen as it was landing. Another thing that was real odd was that this is in a suburban neighborhood with lots of yard animals and none of the dogs were barking at all and the air was dead silent.  As big as the object was and as bright as the lights were, we were expecting to at least hear the neighborhood dogs barking, but none were.  After waiting on the front porch of our home for close to an hour with blankets to keep warm, we finaly decided to go back into the house. We were hoping this craft would come back up from the wooded area and would show itself once again while leaving, but it never did. And no, I don't plan on going in that area of the woods and swamp to see it close up either. I will be keeping a guarded eye on that area for the next few nights and even months to see if anything else happens there.  All I can say about all this is that we're definitely not alone and these things are making themselves known. I'm just wondering why they aren't trying to communicate more clearly if they are superior life forces. It almost feels as though we are like the ants living in the ant farm and they just observe us when they want to. A little food for thought there.  Anyway, thanks for allowing me to vent about this here, because I surely can't tell me friends about this. I'm not sure how they would take it.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,32.5599,-82.8184

It tumbled approx. two to three hundred feet. It stopped then  took off horizontally to the right. I watched it fly in and out of the clouds until I lost it. It was flying  at a rate faster than anything I have seen. I have been around aircraft for many years and this was not the norm.  I have one picture, taken while it is tumbling that shows two sets of lights and with in each set are seven to eight  smaller lights. It is white, but looks solid and not quite flat with lights in the front. Another picture is taken that shows it flying horizontally, no fixed wing or jet engine that I can see, at this point it looked flat. Other pictures are when it is too high to see any detail and these pictures were taken before I even noticed it tumbling.  It was only upon enlarging  these photos did I see it above the rainbow.  Later in the evening , when it was dark, I was walking home from my parents place next door and saw six or seven lights high in the sky. No formation but  all seemed to be flying the same speed. They were not like the airliners or private planes with blinking/strobe lights. The San Jose Airport path is almost directly over head so I am very familiar with their landing prep. These were solid, possibly military.  They were headed north.  I do not know if there was a connection to  my earlier sightings.

As soon as I shut the door I noticed a bright light moving high in the western sky.  I initially dismissed it as a commercial airplane but the size and speed caught my attention.  It was moving faster than any satellite I have ever seen, and extremely bright.  Light was larger than a star and extremely bright; at least a magnitude -4 or -5.  As I stood in the driveway it passed from west to east almost directly overhead.  I have not seen a commercial airplane cruise at such a speed, and it was most definitely not a satellite of any kind. Light was so bright I assumed for a moment it must be a small, quick plane with it’s landing lights on or a  helicopter, but as it passed overhead it began to zig and zag erratically, maintaining a fast course to the general east.  There were no sounds of prop or jet engines whatsoever.  It crossed from west to east in roughly 30-45 seconds, beginning to fade at around a minute and finally winking out high on the horizon.  There were no visible secondary beacons or green/red signals of any kind the entire time, not even as it passed to the east--just one single bright light on a shifting course.  Duration could not have been more than 90 seconds.  Did anyone else see this around 1:00 AM Friday? I cannot explain what that light was. I am of sound mind and have better than average vision. I work in the aerospace field, and this was not any aircraft I could identify. I was not swaying on my feet; the light was definitely moving in an erratic manner. The magnitude remained constant until it began to pass lower into the eastern horizon. I could not make out any sort of structure at any time; it was too bright. All I can liken it too would be a double-sized Jupiter traveling across the sky. At 1:06AM, I stepped back outside facing east. There were no aircraft I could see or hear, but within seconds a small burst of light caught my attention. I spotted a fast satellite moving south to north, flashing every few seconds. Before I could track that one for long I spotted another flashing satellite moving north to south. Both passed close to each other right overhead.  I have seen flashing satellites before, and are usually about magnitude +2; both of these were emitting far brighter flashes than that, I’ve never seen anything like it! It was almost more of a strobe. As soon as the first two passed each other I spotted a third, moving roughly SE to NW. All three seemed to be traveling fast for a satellites but I’m not an expert. Probably nothing, but I still found it interesting to spot three strange satellites barely 15 minutes after sighting such a strange light in the sky.  I also understand that some satellites will flash reflect light, but still.  The clouds drew over within another 20 minutes.  I stepped out twice to smoke before 2:25 AM, and incredibly each time in a break in the overcast, directly overhead, I spotted another brightly flashing satellite moving south to north, just like the others.

Soft lights were evenly spaced on the bottom of the wings.  It moved off toward the west and gained altitude.  The craft flew into a heavier cloud of fog away from me.  It flew beautifully. The night conditions were pretty bright considering the patches light fog in the area.  There was more than a half-moon out, just above the ufo.  I could see the brightest stars in the sky as well as a dimly-lit  group of stars formed in a irregular shaped diamond pattern just below the moon.

I'll bet the people on the jet witnessed the ufo as well. The craft was completely silent.  I live north of Sea-Tac Airport where the planes start their descent to land and the sounds of the planes are easily identifiable.  I could hear the sound of the jet in background yet, this craft being closer, made no sound. The distance of the jet and the ufo were definitely hard to ascertain.

Compared to a modern fighter aircraft, I would guess it was similar in size. It could be twice this size. It was flying at relatively low altitude. Once the craft tilted and made the turn west, I could see the thickness of it.  Looking from the rear of the craft, the height and width appeared to be the same. It wasn't flying at high speed.  I would guess between 65-250 mph.  However, there really is no way to tell with a high degree of certainty because of the distance and size are unknowns as well.  The sighting lasted around 7 seconds. The lights on the ufo were very soft, perhaps with some color.  There was some thin fog in the area so this could have been an illusion.  The jet in the background had much brighter and white lights.  There were 3 lights per 'wing' on the ufo. This aircraft is really impressive.  I think it may be a smaller version of the common chevron sighting reports I've studied.  It has inspired me to create a 3D animation of the event. It was quite the experience.  I knew I couldn't identify it after a few seconds.  I could only describe it as a chevron shaped flying craft.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,,

While travelling South on US-101 at 5:50 AM, several miles north of Ukiah, CA, a small cluster of lights came swooping in at a shallow angle in the opposite direction in front of me, on the east side of the road.  It was moving faster than I would expect a plane to move, and at first I thought it must be a meteor.  As it sped by me, I could see that it was in fact some sort of craft. While on the approach, I could only see a few smallish cluster of bright lights, looking at it from behind, I could see a rectangular grid area strongly lit, most likely the propulsion system. As I continued to look at it in my rear view mirror, I saw that it quickly slowed down, and the rear grid greatly increased in brightness.  Soon after that it disappeard from view, probably around the side of the bank of the road. The craft couldn't have been more than 100 feet above the ground, more likely 50 feet.  After realizing that it wasn't a meteor, the next logical conclusion would be that it was a low flying aircraft, but it was moving quite fast, much faster than 100 miles an hour.  I was only able to see it for about three seconds, even though it was running parallel to the road.  Even though at its closest it couldn't have been more than 300 feet away, it never made even a glimmer of a sound.  However, my windows were up at the time. The lit rectangular grid region on the back of the craft was unusual, however, and I can't quite think of anything I've previously seen that would describe it.  Its flaring up as the craft quickly decelerated was also odd. It was moving so fast, and traveling so close to the ground, that the pilot must have been using night vision, or else have been extremely fool-hardy.",2007-02-01T00:00:00,39.1266,-123.2805

I noticed that the stars that should have been in that part of the sky were no longer visible because something was blocking them out.   As I approached Ft.

The light was bright but you could see through it enough to identify the structure emitting the light.  The light was not in the shape of a beam or floodlight but rather was more iridescent.

I was going south along the QEW highway in Niagara.  It was a clear day, but the lake was dark with a winter storm.  Once in a while I looked toward the lake to my left.  I saw something floating above some houses. I thought it was a kite at first, but as I peered through my window I saw that it was long, thin, and spiral in shape, brownish gold, and that it appeared to be hovering while the body of it just kept spiralling.  It looked a bit like one of those fly-catcher strips.  I looked around to see whether it was tethered somewhere, but saw nothing.  It appeared to be just floating there.  In size, considering its distance from me, I’d say it was about 4 to 5 meters tall. As it left my view the sunlight hit it and it really shone.  That’s the last I saw of it. It happened last week, but I haven’t told anyone, as it was such a silly looking thing, not exactly what one might expect to see floating still on a cold, blustery winter’s day.

I saw three black disk shaped UFOs moving at a constant speed during the day and they were at a very low altitude and moving very slow.,Pittsburgh,PA,2007-02-10T17:00:00,disk,2-3 Minutes,"Occurred : 2/10/2007 17:00  (Entered as : 02/10/07 17:00) Reported: 2/10/2007 3:53:37 PM 15:53 Posted: 2/24/2007 Location: Pittsburgh, PA Shape: Disk Duration:2-3 Minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55242.html,"I saw three black disk shaped UFOs moving at a constant speed during the day and they were at a very low altitude and moving very slow. It was bright daylight when I saw three disk shaped craft in the air, against a bright blue sky.  They were black and flying at a very low altitude.  They weren't moving fast, in fact unusually slow for any aircraft, slower than even a bird would normally fly.  One could say they were hovering but moving at a very slow pace.  I was in the library studying for school at the time the sighting occurred.  I just happened to look out the window I was sitting next to, and there they were.  I also saw a light on the object.  I couldn't tell if there was a light on all three of them, but I only saw one light appear at a time.  The light may have been blinking, or I may have only seen it every so often because the object was rotating.  It was hard to tell what exactly happened although these objects were very close to me.  They changed directions like this while all three of them remained in a very tight formation all moving the exactly the same speed.  They did not slow down to move around one another or anything.  What really seemed out of the ordinary was that the objects were extremely close to one another.  At times it was hard to tell if there was more than one of them; not saying that they became one at any point, but that is how close they were.  The rotated around one another, perhaps in a circle each one taking turns being the lead craft.  They left my sight however as my view became obstructed by the edge of the building.  I then moved to another window to see them, but I did not see them again.  Also peculiar was that there seemed to be more jets than usual after I saw the objects.  Now I have just moved to the city about six months ago, but I know where the airport is and what it looks like when jets and planes leave for takeoff or come in to land.  I saw three different jets, too far away to tell if they were commercial airliners or fighter jets, but it was very unusual.  Usually when looking into the sky there may be one plane every ten minutes that one could see in the sky from where I was, for there to be three at once was very unusual.  They were flying at seemingly random areas of the sky, not anywhere near where they would be if they were coming in to land or were just leaving the airport.  The jets also seemed to be climbing in altitude at an unusually high pace, for whatever reason, but I do not think that commercial airliners would climb at this high of a rate.  Whether this had anything to do with the objects I saw, I do not know, but I do know that this alone was very unusual.  After I saw this occur, I went out again to see if anything else was out there, but there was no sign of any strange objects.  I then went inside while the jets were still flying above me.  I could not unfortunately get a picture of the objects as the camera I have on my phone is could not take a clear picture of the bright sky.",2007-02-24T00:00:00,40.443091945513764,-79.97424169381107

It was close to about 8:00 p.m. but the night was very clear and we clearly saw what was a black diamond/teardrop shape aircraft with a very low profile that made no noise.  From the side it looked like a flat flying saucer but as it banked left and right it had rounded wings that looked like a manta ray.   We did not notice a vertical tail section normally found on an airplane.  It had red and white strobe lights that clearly outlined the crafts shape.  Unlike any other craft I have seen including known stealth planes like the F-117 or B-2.

I didn't pay much attention at first because we are near the Richmond Airport but I then noticed that it was not flying in a straight line such as a normal plane would. I slowed down and pulled off the side of the road as my girl-friend screamed at me for doing so but it was flying as if it was circling looking for something. I watched it go from what seemed like about ten miles in about 2 or 3 seconds. It was what looked like over the airport then it was over the field in front of my neighborhood in a flash. It seemed like it was almost checking me out as it passed over I heard a hissing noise and there were blue and green lights on the bottom and side of the triangular shaped craft. It didn't send out any beams or any type of lights to search around but it seemed like some of the colored lights were flashing more rapidly than the others. The whole time my girlfriend was yelling at me to get into the car and she saw it but didn't have any interest in it other than to say lets get the heck out of here. This is the first time I have ever seen anything of this nature and I don't know if it was the same craft everyone else had seen or even if this was some government craft we don't know about. However being a flight enthusiast myself I know that no known craft could perform the flight characteristics displayed that night. I don't drink or do drugs and was not on any medication so I know what I saw and nobody can convince me otherwise but I sure would like to know what the heck it was. I can say this much if I had doubts of UFO's before I have been totally convinced after witnessing this that we are NOT alone after all. I think the government needs to come forward with the information that it has concerning UFO's and tell the truth because sooner or later one is going to land on the Whitehouse lawn and ! then its all over. I have always believed in this stuff because in being a devout christian I find it hard to believe that GOD would have created such a vast Universe and that we are the only creatures that enhabit the entire Universe. It seems like an aweful waste of space. My girlfriend will not talk much about what happened that night and she doesn't like to watch shows about stuff of this nature but one thing is for sure what we saw scared the heck out of her and she no doubt is a believer now even though she won't talk about it to much. I will close with saying thank you for allowing me to talk about this because I didn't know who to talk to and even if someone would believe me or think I was nuts but I want to thank you for being about to tell my story without being ridiculed. I only wish that I had a camera or something that I could have used to support what I saw because it hung around for what seemed like forever but it was only a couple of minutes but long enough to realize that this craft was not a conventional ship that we know of at this time thats for sure.,2006-12-07T00:00:00,37.64624405286344,-77.29160440528634

They were a hazy yellowish or orange color.  Because we live near a private airport, we are used to a lot of air traffic as well as traffic coming and going from March Airforce Base and Miramar.   Also because of the Palomar Observatory, all of our street lights are dim to allow viewing.  So because of this, we also see very clearly on almost every night meteorites coming down.  These 2 lights were going so quickly that it startled us. There was also no sound coming from them, and believe me, after spending time my whole life around military bases, nothing can fly at that speed without breaking the sound barrier and causing some kind of noise.

As it approached town it seemed more like a helicopter, as it starting descending, al this point you could see others lights of diferent colors rotating, until thier where all sorts of lights.  Approximately after crossing Mexican airspace, and entering U.S. airspace the aircraft gained altitude and speed,doing ackward movements. Descebding and then ascending very rapidly with more multicolor lights, still in a very akward way, at my not at all familiar knowledge of aviation, it seemed like the erratic movements where either evasive moves or it had been hit by some friendly fire.  This conclusion I draw, considering that at some 30 miles away due northwest of Mexicali, there is a U.S. Air Force Base at Seeley California, as well as at some 40 miles due east there is another U.S. Air Force Base in Yuma, Arizona, that leads me to conjure that after being detected by either Mexicali International Airport or U.S.A.F. at Seeley, Ca. or Yuma, Az. once in U.S. airspace Aircrafts and other measures had being taken.

The sky was slightly light-colored and not sharply clear (e.g., not intensely black with entire Milky Way in view), but stars, planets and high-flying airliners and their distinctive running lights were clearly visible.  There was no precipitation, no fog and no moon out at the time.  I stood facing south, looking at the stars and planets in the sky.

The roar stopped abruptly and I saw that there was an object in the sky almost directly overhead - actually west of my position by no more than 700 feet.  It had an altitude of about 1,000 feet and seemed to be a solid black object, triangular in shape, and having three white lights, each at the object’s extremities in a triangular pattern, with a centered red light, blinking regularly and somewhat hurriedly.  As it moved away, the blinking red light made at least one white light appear to be blinking as well – an optical illusion?  The object could be blocked from view by a nickel held at arm’s length. The shape, size and black color were confirmed by how the object blocked the sky and stars from view.  The craft moved quite slowly, smoothly and silently.  Its speed was significantly less than a typical small aircraft; a car would have very easily overtaken it. It was clearly not a helicopter. The object flew south/southwest and could easily be seen for at least 3-4 miles.  As it flew, its altitude was even more clearly seen to be about 1,000 feet. It was the lowest object in the sky.  As it moved southward, the sky and land below and to the east of its path twice glowed with soft diffused white light; however perhaps this could be explained as being the result of weather anomalies, particularly as there was no clear view of any light beam emanating from the object.

I'm not sure if it was ball lightning or something else.  At approximately 11:30pm and after the rain and lightning had passed, I stepped outside on the back porch for a cigarette.  I did not see any lightning at the time or hear any thunder that I recall (but I was not listening for it).  I was facing the north to the back yard and decided to turn around.  Just as I turned to the south, I saw what looked like a comet but larger shoot across the sky.  I can only describe it as a very large comet, white light, with a tail.  It flew under the clouds in the south which would be in the Watertown direction.  Since it was cloudy, the object was low, and quite large (from a distance), I can only estimate that it was not a comet or shooting star.  Stunned (for I've never seen anything like it before), I waited to see if anything else would transpire.  Some lightning did issue from the clouds to the south, along with some thunder shortly after, the kind that webs out of the sky toward the ground, but what I had seen a moment before had shot horizontally from west to east, and was a lone object not attached to any such electrical webbing.  I brushed this even off as being a first time sighting of 'ball lightning'.  This morning I looked it up on the web, and although it is sometimes described as having a tail, I am only coming upon stories of 'ball lightning' ""hovering"" and moving slowly, which is a little confusing to me.  What I saw did not hover or move slowly, nor did it resemble the ball lightning I came upon in a short film on YouTube.  This moved quickly and brightly, like a ball of white fire.  I do suppose it could be ball lightning, but am not sure.  If anyone else in the area had seen it, reported it, or experienced the sort in the past, I would very much like to know.  Thank you very much.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,41.6404,-73.211

My husband and I were outside smoking a cigarette around 11:30 p.m. and he was just telling me about seeing a UFO on the way to work that morning on Sunland Gin Road around 4 a.m., hovering over the crops riding right along side of him. As he was describing the triangular craft with 3 big orange lights when we actually saw it over in the distance! It was facing us, then rotated to its left, our right... So fast that the orange lights left trails going sideways. I was shocked! My husband told me it was definatley the same thing he saw riding ridiculously low to the crops on his way to work. He didn't know what it was. Now I've looked this up on the internet, and I did find a picture of the exact same lights, and the article that followed said these were flares being dropped from a plane. Well I think that is a bunch of B.S. because we actually saw the craft for one thing, and flares being dropped would leave trails going down not sideways. We don't know what this is, whether its some secret military aircraft they're testing out here in the middle of nowhere, or if its aliens but we definately saw it.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,32.7559,-111.671

EVERY star in the sky was white, white maybe a bluish twinkle to it. this was just red blinking light. but it was so tiny to see, i was thinking maybe it was mars, i know thats red, and maybe the atmosphere made the ""blinking"" just much more apparent. after 10 minutes of wondering what it was, i remembered my video camera.  i am an aviation minded person, and i live near BUSH (hobby) airport. i know what an airliner looks like at 40 k, at night....this was MUCH higher. what i did notice about what i saw, was how it moved...but so slow, that i couldn't recognize it at first. the only way was to use reference points on the horizon (my house) over time. when i noticed it didn't follow the same path as the rest of the stars, i started to doubt myself. at first it was moving towards a solo star in the southwestern side of the sky. minutes later, checking my same reference points. it had moved away considerably from the solo star. it also  had two smaller items that were emitted. they were bright white, floated around the ""red blinker"", back and forth a few times, then rejoined. this happened twice. (but not caught on film.)  with the camera, i could then tell it was TWO rapid strobes next to each other going off. but, it also emitted green color as well. it was a third color, but not a third ""bulb""  so both lights went from red to white, and sometimes green. but it was FAST!! like hyper speed Morse code...  the thing disappeared to my naked eye, but i could still hold it on the camcorder. but it was fading. it didn't ""go below the horizon"" it didn't ""take off like a rocket, in some direction..it just FADED...not like an aircraft going over a large distance.i searched for another ten minutes. couldn't find it again.  have 30 minutes of footage (roughly 10 minutes actual, on and off). have no idea what it is.  here is a quick video that i did for an onlinde aviation forum . this is heavily cut just for ""quick and dirty purpsoses"" to see if they have any idea. i have no clue what it is, the way things are these days, its hard to tell, so i try not to speculate...it is what it is.

He was a U.S. Navy veteran who worked on airplane electronics, so he was generally familiar with aviation technology. I was 12 at the time of the sighting, and my brothers were 9 and 7. I have only a vague recollection of the incident. Some years later, my mother also had an encounter with a UFO - a lighted, spinning disc she saw late at night on the neighbor's lawn. She's reluctant to discuss the incident for fear people will think she's crazy, but I hope to eventually write down her account of the experience and share it with NUFORC.]  The Mysterious Lights  It was somewhere between 8:30 and 9:00 p.m., say about 8:45. The date was March 2, 1977.  The kids were watching Grizzly Adams on TV and I just sat down myself, as I had just finished showering. [My wife] was in the bathroom, bathing.  We heard a noise, a low roar much as a jet, but it sounded low, too low for a jet. I expected it was a helicopter, actually I believed it was a number of helicopters, because it did not sound like it was high enough to be a jet. The noise slowly became very loud, you could feel the vibrations!  Now I became puzzled, my mind expected certain familiar things to take place, and when they didn't, I was puzzled. I expected the ""slap-slaps"" the helicopter rotors make, but there wasn't any. Now I decided to investigate. The kids also were puzzled and said, ""What’s that noise?"" ""Airplanes,"" I said. ""Stay here, I'm going to see what I can see."" I was sort of afraid of what I might find and didn't want the kids involved if it was bad.  I went outside and saw 3 bright lights moving slowly, from northwest to southeast. They seemed low and close. The noise was very loud. My first impression was that it was 3 airplanes spaced in a triangular formation. They were not directly overhead but past me, and moving very steadily away from me. The lights were bright and they did not change relationship to each other, and I looked for but could not see the expected blinking red and green airplane running lights.  This viewing occurred in a very short time span, say 10 or 15 seconds. I had on my eyeglasses, but decided to get my binoculars in the closet just inside the door. I ran in the house and took them out of their case but fumbled with the lens covers and wasted too much time returning outside. By now the lights were well past my observation point but still visible to me. I put the glasses on them and had only a second or two before the lights were obstructed by the branches of a leafless tree. I looked for another few seconds and only could see 3 bright lights. I took down the glasses and was going to move so the tree would not obstruct my view. I looked around and decided no other place gave an unobstructed view and put the glasses back up. I only found one light and just as I did, it went out. I presumed it went behind a tree branch, waited for it to reappear, but it didn’t, so I presumed it went over the horizon.  During the viewing interval, the noise remained strong for quite some time, even though the lights steadily moved away from me. When I had the binoculars the noise was diminishing, but I don't remember how it ended, whether it just stopped or droned on out of earshot.  [My father added the following notes to his account some time afterward:]  This write-up was done after an interval of weeks after the incident. I wish I had done it the very next day.  .. One point that my story doesn't make very well, the noise was TREMENDOUS! It was the most distinctive aspect of this tale, not the 3 lights, although the lights were unusual and important to the incident.

I had been transmitting and talking to another ham radio station. During the end of the converstion with the other station I noticed a large drop in the power line voltage. It dropped to the point that my ratio equipment would not functin correctly. I then shut down my station and left the building to go back to the building where I lived and go to bed.  As I left the building with where my radio station was, I noticed a bight, perfectly round shaped light hovering about 100 feed above the ground close to the runway that was on the Coast Guard base. This distance from me was maybe 300 yards. As I watched the object it moved up to an altitude of about 500 ft and down several times. I continued wo watch it. It then hovered perfectly still and then began moving in strange angles back and forth. It then climbed up to several hundred feet, and suddenly shot away into space like a flash. The acelleration was very rapid and the movement was very erratic....It was gone, I mean gone.  I stood there completely stunned for several minutes, shaking in awe. I then went back to the barracks and woke up one of my buddies to tell him the story.  At first I thought it might be a light from a hellicpoter, but there was NO sound, and the movements were too sharp and erratic to be any normal aircraft. Was this craft attracted to my radio signals in the moments before I came out of the building? Was it attempting to communicate with me by messing with the power?

I was with two friends of mine talking in our development outside our houses.  At the time were High School students just talking about life.  As we were talking we noticed a helicopter object that seemed to be hovering by the Blue Mountain.  We assumed at first it was Life Lion (the local helicopter rescue service) trying to save someone around the mountain.  What surprised us was the amount of time it hovered about the mountain.  I was used to Life Lion rushing to a scene and then rushing back to the hospital.  But it wasn't the case here.  So I pointed it out in our conversation we were having and then realized the object was coming our direction, which we thought was normal because we were on the way to the hospital.  Then things got strange.  The speed of the object increased and it seemed to be upon us in moments.  Now at the time, I was taking flying lessons and I knew nothing could move that fast except a jet, and a very fast jet at that.  It would have to be approaching Mach 1 to be able to move from the mountain to us in mere seconds.   As it quickly approached we saw the object wasn't a helicopter at all but something quite different.  As it approached we saw that it had 3 points and was shaped like a triagle.   As it got closer we realized that the object was HUGE and very low.  The object was more of a isosceles triangle with the front point the brightest.   The object was about a football field long and 50 yards wide.   When it came upon us we thought it would fly over because it was moving so fast but then slowed to a crawl.  It came right above us at about 200 to 300 feet.  It made very little noise if any noise at all.  I kinda remember a hum though.   At this point we were in shock of the object because it had stopped with its brightest front point right above us.   A few seconds past and then the bright front point of the ship shot a spot light on the street in front of us.  I can only describe it as human made spot light.  Everything about this object seemed completely outstanding except the light.  It just seemed like a spot light.   Needless to say my companions and myself were not going to stay put and test the theory out.  So we ran for cover.  I ran to a basketball pole and by the time I got there I realized that the light stopped.  I looked up and the object was then heading South-East towards Hershey.

It happened very fast, and it was even luminous against the very bright bridge lights. It was unmistakable. No one in the area semeed to have seen it, so I forgot about it. That was until I saw that others in NY had seen it too. I think it may have been shooting towards Fort Wadsworth, where there has been UFO sightings before. I feel that whole area under Fort Wadsworth is hollow, going back to the 1700's; and DoD, Army, Coast Guard etc all have bases there. I think these orbs are energy fields, enabling these crafts to cheat normal physics. I wanted others to know what they saw was real.",2006-12-14T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

I saw this one light appear and my first thought was, ""It must be a radio tower.""   Then a second light appeared right next to the first light.  Approximately one second later a third light appeared.  The lights then went off in reverse order then came back in the order in which they appeared the first time.  In all there were four white lights.  One was stationary and the three appeared and disappeared in a methodic manner.   It was not totally black out as there was a nearly full moon.  I could make out that it was a craft of some sort as it appeared to rotate slowly. It made no sound. Then, suddenly it was like someone turned off a light switch and it was gone. I got on the phone with my wife and explained to her what I had seen. While on the phone with her I was looking around the sky trying to locate the light. I looked to the North (the complete opposite direction) and way off to the north on the horizon I could see the same light pattern. In both instances the object did not appear to be traveling in a certain direction. On the way back from Somerton AZ two days later I carefully reviewed the area where I had made the sighting. There were no mountains, No towers and no homes. There was only open desert and a cow every so often. I called my dad in Indianapolis after speaking with my wife that night. I began to explain what I had just seen and in the middle of me explaining he chimed in and finished my sentence. He said he had seen the exact same thing about 30 years ago in Greenfield Indiana.

As I drove toward Wall Triana Hwy I noticed two bright lights above a field that was located next to a Grocery Store.  Normally I wouldn’t have paid any attention, except there were no flashing lights and they were very low to the ground I’d say close to three hundred feet off the ground.   They were very still and seemed to be motionless. I decided to pull into the parking lot of the grocery store so I could get a better view.  I pulled to the side where the field was and sat facing the field so I could observe this.  The whole time I was speaking on the phone to my boyfriend.  When I finally parked the car I could see that these were not just two big lights rather they were a multitude of lights arranged in a triangular shape. I rolled down my window and the only sound was that from the hwy behind me, no noise as that of a plane could be heard. The first craft began to move south at a slow pace. I’d say at a maximum speed of 10mph. Then a moment later the second craft followed. The first craft had a row of four white lights, then a row of three, the middle light on this row was red. Then a row of two lights and one light to complete a triangle. The red light in the center of the craft was blinking, but all other white lights remained solid and consistent. The second craft was exactly the same as the first one, however it lacked the red light, only white lights in the shape of a triangle. As the crafts moved over head you could make out a faint shape around the triangle, the only way you could even notice was that it would block out stars as it moved even though the triangle part wasn’t over the star yet. Both craft continued at this slow pace until I could not see them from the front anymore and then they became invisible in the night sky. I didn’t have anyone else in the car, nor did I have a camera. Believe me I wish I had both! Where I live is close to Red Stone Arsenal (military base) and Huntsville used to be headquarters for NASA.

In the preparation of our night to see what I saw last night, I told them to observe all the craft in the air for a better comparison of when the objects do show themselves again, or if they would. 	The night before the lights indicated they will make themselves shown to me again, and that is why I brought witnesses the next night. So as we looked at the flash that occurred every 11 seconds, I told them to wait and see if it moves into any direction that would indicate it was a plane with a flashing light. I thought it could have been the space station (maybe) or a satellite that happen to give of flashes every 11 seconds. As time went on, all indications showed that most likely it was neither of my guesses that I proposed. There was a sudden flash every 11 seconds and lasted a total of 5 minutes. My brother T.J. said that he was going inside because it was making him uncomfortable, but I reassured him that it was just a flashing light and nothing more. But I did add on that it was just the beginning of our sighting. 	When the flashes stopped, 2 minutes later 3 lights in perfect formation came down out of""nowhere"" and was moving in a southeast to northwest direction, and when it became closer, the lights went out and the 3 objects where 500 ft. above us without any lights. A good comparison would be that of a car without any headlights that would pass by on a dark street. So when the 3 lights came down, I pointed it out to my brothers with excitement, and we observed it as it went on its path. Again the difference between objects that we are familiar with that fly in our air is that they seem mechanical in movement rather than a natural way of moving. The three objects seemed as big as an SUV, 500 ft above us, with no lights, and a white surface that seemed like a oval shape but a not exactly (it was a very unique shape). The objects were visible for 30 seconds as it moved behind a cloud. The expectation of it following its direction was very high, because why would anyone expect anything else. 	But as the expectation of it exiting the cloud was high, it never exited the cloud.  I stared at the cloud as it moved away; making sure that it was not going to exit it.  The clouds were about 500 ft above us moving swiftly across the sky in this chilly somewhat breezy night.  If it was a bird that was as big as an SUV moving into a cloud, you would expect it to exit it, but it never did.  At 11 pm we decided to go inside and take an hour break and go back outside to see if we can see them again. What is unfortunate is that my younger brother (Robby 14 yrs) did not see the 3 objects because he wears glasses and his eyes were improving, so I needed to get him new ones, but he did see the sudden flash every 11 seconds. We went back at 12 am and waited for 30 minutes to see any indication that we will see something again, but we gave up and went to bed. This life is interesting, and interesting things happen. I am just glad and honored that I got to see what most people have never seen, and enjoyed it with my brothers. I just feel that the last 2 days was a way of letting the world know through my 2 sightings that we are getting closer to the day where the boundaries that we have set for our own kind will be broken, and we will truly embrace freedom.  This is just the beginning and I am glad for it. My story of seeing unidentified objects is not a new one, but it is a unique one that should definitely be looked into by people that have good intentions, and the resources to do it. But truly I don’t even think we have to go far anymore to get answers, because the answers to this mystery will be coming soon. ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from same source.

It was so bright though I just kept watching it.

At this point it was probably 5 miles or so away. After 10 minutes I was directly south of it and within a mile. At this point I could see it had no strobes, was alternating between a hover and very tight circles and the light had a color that just didn't look normal.

I noticed one of the planes in the area begin descending sharply towards the object and realized it was one of a few military jets when it came closer. When it was about a mile or so away the object suddenly dimmed and then it just kind of blinked to a spot 5 miles or so to the north west. It began it's bright light show again and moved off slowly until I couldnt see it anymore.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,30.3368,-97.3446

This object was traveling almost directly north with about a 10-30 degree westerly direction, (using a 360 degree compass).  The object traveled two (2) times faster than a satellite; possibly three (3) times faster than a satellite.  This craft traveled in a straight line for 8-10 seconds & then faded out.  I did not hear any sound at all from this craft.  It is extremely difficult for me to determine the altitude of this object, which as I think about it, is truly another odd characteristic of this craft.  (I will explain this comment further in the text).  The sky was 100% cloudless, very clear, and a beautiful day that everyone was commenting about.  The temperature was about 78 degrees with calm winds & moderate to low humidity.  I was getting my car washed, and was walking my dog and looking up at the sky when I observed this craft.  (I had a video camera in the trunk of my car, but this object was moving so quickly, there was absolutely no time to go back for it).  Holding my hand straight out, my thumb would easily cover this craft.  The best description on size I could think of was that this craft was about the same size as a very high flying plane that you can just make out on an extremely clear day, maybe a plane at 30,000-40,000 feet or so.  In other words, a plane that you CAN completely make out, but is absolutely tiny as seen with the naked eye because its altitude is so high.  With this said, it should be understood that I have been a plane fanatic since I was small child.  It should also be understood I enjoy looking for and watching night time satellites & have easily seen 100 in my life.  (Out in the country on one night, I observed eight satellites in a 2-3 hour time period, I know what satellites look like).  I have grown up close to a major civilian airport, and also around a military airport.  I can easily estimate the altitude of just about any plane or helicopter with relative accuracy.  But with this object, I am having a real problem with even attempting to guess its altitude to an almost frustrating degree.  I do not understand this.  My best guess is that this object was at an altitude of 10,000 to 40,000 feet.  I am leaning toward roughly 30,000 feet.  I will say that I do not believe it was any lower than approximately 10,000 feet.  I have no idea how large this circular craft was.  However, this craft looked remarkably similar to the craft seen in the videos that are repeatedly taped in Mexico.  I am speaking of the dozens of white (apparently circular) craft that fly together usually in formation, sometimes in, ""swarms.""  The craft I saw looked like one of these craft, but at an apparently higher altitude and moving much faster than most of the videos I have seen of similar craft.  I will say that this thing was really moving; it had to be going at least 4,000 mph or much faster depending on its altitude.  No sonic boom, no sound at all.  I should add that I was wearing sunglasses.  The brand name of these sunglasses is, ""Costa Del Mar.""  I paid about $140 dollars for these about seven years ago.  What distinguishes these sunglasses from the corner store sunglasses is the coating.  Without getting technical, these sunglasses make objects extremely vivid & clear as compared to any other sunglasses I have ever owned or come across.  (These sunglasses are actually fisherman’s sunglasses, although I do not fish).  When I first purchased them, I was amazed how vivid & clear birds & planes appeared.  My point is that, with the exceptionally clear weather, together with my 20/20 vision, and the added clarity of these sunglasses, I was able to determine this craft’s shape.  This object was not glowing white, no lights, no pulsing.  It was simply a clear, vivid white.  Besides my inability to determine the objects altitude & size, another odd characteristic was its movement.  I would not describe it as flying, but as gliding. This is simply my perspective.  I do not believe this was a daytime satellite.  The reason I do not believe this was a satellite was that I could make out this craft’s shape which was, although tiny, clearly round.  A second reason I do not believe this was a satellite was because this thing was moving faster than any object I have ever seen in my life; two to three times faster than any satellite.  With that said, and to be completely objective, I do not recall observing a day time satellite--only early morning or late evening satellites.  So if it was a day time satellite, why was it clearly round, and why was it moving so fast?  I am in my mid thirties, and have never seen a UFO in my life.  And it is not for lack of trying; I am constantly sky watching.  I have no idea what this object may have been except a UFO. ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS)) Dear ((name and title deleted)),  Thank you very much for the excellent report!  You seem to us to be an excellent witness, and you compose prose unusually well, which is something we observe here only rarely. Did the object generate a contrail, please?  Also, was its shape similar to any type of aircraft that you can imagine?  For example, if it had wings, were they swept back, or similar to a delta-winged aircraft, perhaps.  Also, do you have any idea why the object faded from view?  It seems unusual that the object disappeared from view, given that you sighted it during daytime.   Thanks, again, for sharing the information with our Center, and for taking the time to compose such a nice report.  We will be posting newly received reports tomorrow, and yours will be among them.  By the way, we just received two reports tonight, one from Texas, and one from Sacramento.  The TX sighting may have been of a satellite, but the CA sighting was of a totally dark, motionless, triangular craft, that reportedly was seen hovering above a busy intersection in Sacramento.  Many cars stopped, so that the occupants could get a better look at it.  Cordially,  Peter Davenport, Director National UFO Reporting Center Seattle, WA Hotline:  (206) 722-3000 (8:00 a.m. to midnight)   ((END MESSAGE)) ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS)) Thank you, I have a ((deleted--degree)) in ((deleted--writing)) although my regard for the media is abhorrent at best. No, absolutely no contrail whatsoever.  (And there were no contrails in the sky that I noticed as well). Its shape was not similar to any aircraft I have ever seen including the alleged Aurora.  I have been to a few air shows, and pride myself on distinguishing most military aircraft & have done so since I was in 7th grade. No wings, no swept back wings like the F-14.  Not delta-winged.  This object was clearly circular in shape.  Yes, I failed to answer this in my report & knew while I was writing it that this was not clearly stated.  I do not know why it faded from my view.  Perhaps this object was much higher than 40,000 feet.  In layman’s terms, if 12 O’clock is straight up, I observed this object at about 12:30 and, ""lost"" it at about roughly 2 O’clock.   It was moving.  Possibly it was in the atmosphere.  I just cannot answer this.  I will say that this object, this craft, was indeed difficult to see & perhaps I just lost sight of it.  My best guess, and this is a guess, is that it was at 30,000 to 40,000 feet, a tiny 30 foot disc, and I just lost sight of it.  You are welcome.  Thank you for all you have done.  By the way, we just received two reports tonight, one from Texas, and one from Sacramento.  The TX sighting may have been of a satellite, but the CA sighting was of a totally dark, motionless, triangular craft, that reportedly was seen hovering above a busy intersection in Sacramento.   Many cars stopped, so that the occupants could get a better look at it.  Ok, at about 10 pm to 10:15 pm, I was walking my dog & listening to my ((deleted)) on my cell phone.  I looked up at the stars as I always do.  I noticed what appeared to be a bright star.  It caught my eye for just a second or two, I believe because it may have been moving, I am not sure, and I looked back down.  (Just a normal bright star).  I looked up maybe five seconds later and this, ""star,"" was gone and that really caught my attention.  So I carefully watched the sky roughly where this, ""star,"" had been, and then noticed a typical looking satellite, a satellite that has, ""dimmed,"" after not being lit up by the sun, but is clearly visible.  (It was traveling north).  I only saw this apparent satellite after it had, ""dimmed,"" for a couple of seconds before it clearly disappeared from my view.  This ""dimmed"" satellite moved at the speed as per normal for all satellites I have observed.  As I was still looking up at the sky, I then noticed a very dimly lit V-shaped formation of maybe 8 to 10, ""birds"" (?) moving north/north-east.  If these were birds, they kept one hell of a tight formation.  I lost these, ""birds"" within a few seconds.   I have NEVER seen anything that I considered could possibly be a UFO until I submitted my report.  I was literally typing the report when my ((deleted)) called & ((deleted))  So I walked my dog.  The first object was probably a satellite, the second object very possible birds.  But the second object was simply odd because this formation was so tight and literally kept perfect formation.  It truly looked like the typical V-shaped formation that has so often been seen.  This was so weird that I could not bring myself to submit a second report--in the middle of my first UFO sighting/report of my life; I walk outside and see this.  But after the two sightings you mentioned I felt I should at least mention this.  Again, this is so odd, that I never would have mentioned this had you not mentioned these sightings.  Please understand this information is absolutely true, absolutely sincere, and not a joke in any form.  I do not know what else to say.

I do not know if this was a dream or not, but this is the 2nd time this experience has happened to me in the past 4 years.  The first time was when I awoke I assume in my sleep, a kind of outer body experience is what I call it, to look outside my window to the front lawns.  I noticed that it was a more than an average stary night as if there was no light being generated from Earth to hide the stars, basically it was very clear and the stars seemed closer and larger than usual.  As I looked out, what I describe as a small triangular craft with one round bright white light at the end of each point landed outside the front of my house.  It was totally silent.  I noticed the texture of this craft, which was a pure black and a shiny material, quite outstanding.  Whatever it came for, it stayed for some 5 minutes, then took of again and as quickly as it came.  Now we have all heard about people who have whitnessed triangular craft before, but after deliberation, some I am sure have been lucky enough to whitness these strange phenomena, I beleive.  Either way, as so many claim to of seen these triangular craft with simular descriptions across the world to what I have whitnessed, there appears or must be something behind it, rather than the scientists claiming it may be a trick of the mind, or a weather phenomena, which I beleive is an insult to the intellegence of the average person.  Why would someone make up and go into such great details, and why so many people?.  To  gain attention?, I think not, not in my case and I am sure not in many other cases.  Now last night, what I can only describe as a larger triangular ship that can only be from the same means, whatever it is was hovering above my house.  But this time, it did not land, and it was at least 5-6 times larger than the one I had seen previously several years earlier.  It was the same material for sure, was the same shape, and I suppose as mad as this sounds the only way I can describe this shape, as being something like the US military would design going on maybe a larger stealth bomber style maybe?.  I was not scared of this, felt at great ease and I was allowed to observe this craft which I am obviously in awe off and honoured to off been allowed to view as it was quite magnificent.  This is one of many strange experiences that have happened to me since I was around the age of 5 years old when I have experienced a number of major outer body experiences ""OBE'S"" I beleive people call them, such as waking up within my sleep I assume?, and being unable to turn lights on and feeling either the energy of mother nature making its buzzing present, or an unknown force nearby etc, etc, if that makes any sense.  But from 2001 they had been more prominent in my life, where seeing and doing stuff out of the norm such as (spinning into pure light, and being helped and guided to the exact spot in order to do this by what I call the ""unknown force"", whether mother nature or other?) seemed to happen on a regular basis.  I am far as I am concerned, this is one of a number of unexplained things that have happened to me and I am convinced others have the same ability, or have experienced simular phenomena, which I have tried hard to understand, but I still have not quite got to grasp with what it is I have been whitnessing through my life, whether I am simply going mad, or whether there really has been something aiding me through my life in general, or something trying or has been communicating with me?.  One thing it has given me is faith and belief in myself which has made me a far stronger person for it.  Is this simply a mind thing, am I mad, or have I genuinely whitnessed something out of this world?.  Also is it possible that one can gain information about future technological breakthroughs via the subconscious mind?, before they have happened or been discussed, such as Fusion technology to name just one, even though one had no knowledge of this before?.  I realise this mail is somewhat jumbled and may look like jargon to many of you.  But remember, when these things happen to people, to explain them in a mail is harder than you think.  I am open to suggestions and I have not made my final decision as to what I think it is.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,,

It was a full moon and we simultaneouly saw a light appear, move and stop about 15,000 feet above downtown Phoenix.  The easiest way for me to explain its movement is to have you hold your extended arm straight out in front of you, then hold your thumb and index finger about four inches apart - that is how far this thing move in a second, after appearing out of nowhere. After acting like a satellite, it just stopped and hovered in the same spot for 20-30 minutes.  We had convinced ourselves that we imagined it before it moved about the same distance in downward and behind a desert tree. Before moving, two airplanes with navagational lights passed over the orb, and Phoenix at approx. 30,000 feet. The orb was a good 5 miles from us.  The round, glowing craft had colors ""scanning"" around it which reflected off what seemed like a mist around it. Two of the lights coming from the orb appeared to scan a wide swath around my friend and I. The first was a bluish color that was wide and tall, and it moved up and down. The second 'beam' was more focused and white, and it seemed to come directly nears us and scan through us in a sideways motion. Pink and red colors were also present in the overall rotational pattern.  About that same time, strange noises were coming from the brush on the other side of the cattle-guard, steel fence surrounding the house and pool area. The nearest house was two hundred yards away with open desert and tall brush between houses.  On two occasions, and in two different areas, I swore that I could see a blue glow that seemed to be coming from a specific point 100 yards into the brush.  The first noise was like a muffled duck call, very quiet and over and over again from different areas. Then the brush moved violently as though something ran through it in one area. Then crackling was heard in another area.  The other noise sounded like pieces of hard wood knocking together because something was moving around, or communicating from different areas of the brushy desert - multiple somethings moving around with them around their necks or something.  The hair was standing all over my body at that point. My friend concurred. I felt as though I was begin watched from outside the fence by something, much like an animal in the zoo must feel.  Then there was a flash (like a camera flash 100 yards away) and all the noise in the brush suddenly stopped. It was deadly quiet! Even the dog quit barking. We joked that the aliens took the dog (it barked again later).   I have since left my friend's house and have been watching the orb.  It is now 12:46 and on the move again. It has now moved two inches straight down and to the right since 12:11 (at least it is straight down the side of my window. By 12:55 it was five inches farther in same direction and then blocked out of my view by highway 202.  It looked like it was slowly going west across the city toward Buckeye when I lost it.

There were few or no clouds at least in this area of the sky and the sunlight was very bright - the object initially had a mirror-like display and was extraordinarily transitory.  If one imagines a vaguely metalic, oblong sphere, where the sunlight reflected on it in such a way as to make a ""Nike"" like swoosh around the edge of it, that would be a fair enough approximation.  The object remained visibile initially only long enough to see the reflection-like swoosh glisten around the edge, then seemed to disappear from sight. Judging from the size of airplanes at that distance and height, the object would have been huge for anything that flies.  My guess is that you could stack up ten or more 747s to get the height and if it was genuinely spherical you wouldn't still approach the volume.  The only thing I am accustomed to seeing in the sky of that size would be a small cloud. About 1-2 minutes later, from the vantagepoint of the southbound Price curve intersecting into Dobson, another whitish object (the same?) was similarly briefly visible overhead, this time much higher (35-50 thousand feet depending on the actual size of the object) and characteristically smaller to sight.  It had the look of making an upwards arc, in a corkscrew-like motion - that this motion could be perceived in such a short time - no more than a few seconds - would suggest extraordinary speed.  It gave the impression that it was moving so fast that to take one's eyes off of it even for an instant (i.e.: to pay attention to traffic), one would lose track of it - and in fact that happened.  Assuming both of these were the same object, the first view was from the side while the second was more from below and in the second view it had a rather boxy quality. Despite scanning the sky, no further sightings were made. I live in the Phoenix valley and am familiar with cloud types and formations and their general altitudes, so on a clear day like today I believe I can make reasonably accurate estimations of aerial objects' altitudes.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,,

It appeared the aircraft was heading to runway 30L at Lambert.   The commercial aircraft had its nose light on, when I noticed a light that at first appeared to be a spot light in the sky.  It was moving fairly rapidly and straight.  I thought it looked like a flight of geese, in a similar formation.  Then I realized it was not changing shape like geese do.  The object appeared to be a triangle shape of lights that were not very bright.  One side seemed longer than the other and had a straight line of lights on the tail end.  It was silent and blocked out the light from stars it passed in front of.  It moved at a rapid pace faster than the commercial aircraft that would have been to it's left.  Had the pilots seen the object, it would have been viewed by the co-pilot at about a 1 o'clock high position.  The unknown object then passed above the commercial aircraft and continued on a 290 course.   I spent 20 years in the United States Air Force with over 5000 flight hours and know this was no aircraft I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and found him to be quite sober-minded.  Given his manner over the telephone, combined with his experience around aircraft while he was in the U. S. Air Force, we suspect that he probably is an excellent, and qualified, witness.

We were watching TV and I looked over my shoulder outside looking due east and saw a very shiny round object moving quite fast at about a 45 degree angle from my view coming from the south and heading north over the city, then moving NE until it disappeared.  Our area has a large lake with mountains surrounding the lake.  The lake is at an altitude of 1130 feet above sea level (according to Google Earth) and our home is about 1710 feet above sea level, or 580 feet above the lake due west of Kelowna and the bridge crossing the lake to the west side.  I cannot get a cloud level, but the mountains in the area are about 5,000 feet above sea level in the area where the object was moving towards and the clouds were well above that level.  I will try to find the bottom of the cloud level should anybody be interested, but have tried and only received answering services from weather, TV, radio phone numbers called.  My wife and I went onto our deck and watched this object for about two minutes as it flew in a northerly direction, stopping many times, flying left, right, up and down in an erratic pattern as it moved north heading over Kelowna and off into the distance, going into the clouds, and coming back out, and finally disappearing into the distance behind the clouds.  My wife watched it through binoculars while I took 4 still pictures and one video.  You can see the object in several of the still shots and in the video, but not too good.  My camera is a Cannon Power Shot SD550.  I’ve drilled down on the computer to see the object closer in the still shots and there appears to be a triangle shape inside the round sphere.  The object was very, very shinny, and the weather conditions was mostly cloud cover, and only a little area where sun came through, however it looked as those the object was a mirror reflecting the sunlight that was not there.  It’s apparent size was smaller than the moon at over head by less than half that size, but larger than any other object we’ve ever seen such as Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, or any such objects.  It appeared to be considerably larger than a small aircraft when it was over Kelowna, something which we are used to seeing in that direction as that was the direction of the airport.   However, it did not go towards the airport, flying finally in a NE direction. In our opinion it was flying many times faster than any aircraft flies through the valley, including commercial jets or private jets, and as I said, in a jerking motion.  There was no noise that we could hear.  We have called the local radio and TV station and will continue to do so, but so far have only received recorded messages.  We have never ever reported things like this, and this is the first one my wife has seen, but not the first one I’ve seen.  I’ve never reported any other such things to anybody.  I am 62 years old, retired, well traveled, having owned many businesses, and I’m not prone to imagine such things.  Regards,  ((names and address deleted)) Place Kelowna, BC  P.S.

At first I assumed these were large soaring birds such as eagles or vultures, but as they moved across the sky from south to north, I could tell that they were too large and symmetrical to be birds, and that their movement was too even. As they passed by at their closest point to my view (directly to the east from my building) I was able to look at them with binoculars, and could make out what seemed to be 4 lobes, somewhat shaped like a compacted clover shape, which made an overall diamond silhouette with rounded corners.  Given the lowering light, and that the objects were backlit against a brighter sky, I couldn't see any surface details.  I called my wife in from another room, and she was able to see enough to realize that these weren't birds, or (commonly seen) aircraft. I counted 3 definite objects of this description, and a possible 4th as well.  However, this 4th object I did not see until the group had traveled much further to the north, and had become too distant (small in perspective) to be sure it was of the same type.  Of the 3 I have more certainty about, 2 were closer together, with the 3rd about double the distance again ahead and slightly above the others. The objects' movement was rather fast, but very smooth and silent and steady to the north.  While the movement of these objects seemed somewhat balloon-like, the complex shape keeps me from any definite identification.  I did some Google image searching for weather and radar balloons, but did not see anything remotely similar to what I saw in the sky.  I also have not seen any other mention or explanation in the local media.  I did not witness any lights, odd movement, or other classical ""UFO"" behavior from these objects, but they are flying objects that are unidentified nonetheless.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,44.95305527415144,-93.11475467362925

Directly across from my balcony is another condo complex, approximately 75-100 feet away.  The two run parallel and there is a long grassy lane that runs between them.

I continued to smoke until I noticed that the lights were closer and appeared to be much lower in the sky than I originally thought.  I watched the lights move toward me, to the south, and when the closest one broke the plane of the twilight, the silhouette I observed appeared to be a black sphere shape with 4-5 lights on it.

They jumped around and changed shapes. At first it was circular, then elongated, then it stretched from side to side, then it extended into an arch, zig zagging, spiraling. Back and forth the lights changed shapes. I wondered at that point if my hands were shaking causing this to happen, so I steadied my arms on the deck railing. The lights continued to transform into all different shapes. What was interesting was that the lights were very bright, almost neon in nature.

I saw something unusual on my drive home from work tonight.   I work near O'Hare in Chicago, and live underneath one of the flight paths, so I'm accustomed to seeing aircraft in the sky.  In addition, I've been a life long aviation enthusiast, so I often watch the sky's. This evening I saw a light pattern that I've NEVER seen on a commercial or military aircraft.  I was heading westbound on Lake St. in Bloomingdale IL, and had just past Bloomingdale Ave.  I noticed what at first I thought to be a plane in the sky, on final approach to O'Hare, heading in a north easterly direction.   However, the object caught my eye, because of the flashing lights that it was producing.  I saw what initially appeared to be wingtip landing lights, except that they were flashing in an alternating pattern.  I found this unusual, because I've never seen a commercial airliner ""flash"" it's landing lights like this.  I also observed a smaller, flashing red light on top of the object.   Then, as I'm pondering this, all of the sudden, four to five more white lights illuminate sequentially from right to left along the same horizontal plane between what I considered the ""wing tip"" lights and they began to flash intermittently as well!  That is something that I have NEVER seen a commercial  airplane do!    At this point, I was paying so much attention to the object that I decided to pull off and turn around before I hit another vehicle on the road.  However, by the time I did so, I had lost sight of it, and could only see ""normal"" air traffic in the pattern. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed to us to be unusually eloquent and credible.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  We have estimated the time of the sighting, and assigned an arbitrary time.  The witness could not enter a time in our Online Report Form, and have it function normally.

My general feeling was that it was a much greater distance away, and was not actually over the town.

I was looking toward the southeast. I saw a flashing yellow light.  As it got closer, I noticed that this object was low.  The surrounding hills are about 500 -1000 feet high.  The craft kept moving to my right and at this point I saw 3 colors. The right side was the yellow light.  The middle was red and the left side was white.  The shape of the craft was like a cylinder, in that all of the lights seemed uniform in size and shape. What was strange was that the craft, which I thought was a plane or helicopter, its lights would dim and brighten up at the same time.  It was not like the usual ""blip"" of a plane, but the lights would fade in and out, all at the same time.  Imagine opening and closing your hand.  That was the effect. The moon is almost full, so I could see the silhouette of the hills to my right.  The object crossed over the first set of hills, and then disappeared behind the 2nd.  The hills at this point are no higher than 500 feet.  So, I expected whatever this was to bank over them and then go to the local airport only 3 or 4 miles away. The object never reappeared. I was not in a very noisy area, but not perfectly quiet, so I cannot tell you if it was making any sounds. One very interesting thing is that at about 7:00 to 7:15 PM a large helicopter flew over our town.  Although the moon was out, the helicopter was at about 2 o’clock and I could not make out its shape against the night sky. I heard the helicopter first, and then saw that it had a yellow or orange light. It made the usual ""blip.""  A very small white light preceded these lights.  It was very hard to see because of the streetlights, but based on its location, this helicopter was very long.  It could have been one of the dual propeller ones. Anyway, it banked over the town and headed northwest.  As it left, there were 2 lights in the back, blipping at different quick intervals, then a minute later, back to only one. We have had helicopters fly over before.  However, they usually land at the airport.  This one banked away from the airport, and disappeared. Anyway, I actually expected to see a flash of light because of how low the craft was.  I thought it was going to crash.  However, there was no flash.  All I know is that this tri-colored cylindrical object was visible for about 1 to 2 minutes, and then disappeared behind some hills.

Intense white, blue and red colours I was the only witness as the rest of my family has gone to bed.  I was watching TV but the blinds were open and a bright light appeared from behind the edge of the rooftop of the house opposite mine.  The object was in view for approximately 30 minutes and then it disappeared behind the outline of the chimney on the same house opposite. I am 22 years old and a recent Psychology graduate.  I am currently studying in preparation to begin a medical degree in September 2007.  I have perfect eyesight and at the time of viewing this object, I was completely sober and alert.  I’m now writing this description immediately after viewing the object. As the object appeared from behind the edge of the rooftop it caught the corner of my eye as I was watching TV.  It was hard to determine the shape because it was obviously very far away, but it seemed round.  I thought it might be a star but because I live in London it is unusual to see such a bright star and with the naked eye I could not see any other stars in the sky from my living room.  This was partly because there is a sodium street lamp right outside my house which generates quite a lot of orange light. I noticed almost immediately that this round bright object was pulsating.  I would say it was pulsating every 3-5 seconds.  Also I originally thought it was white but soon realised it was actually very colourful. It was predominantly a bright white but parts of it were blue and red.  With the naked eye it was about the size of a typical large star in the night sky. I went to get some binoculars and then the colours and pulsating were very obvious - it was quite mesmerizing.  Through the binoculars I could see some very faint stars in the night sky around the object and I would say the object was 5 times as large as the stars and 10 times as bright.  It was very bright to look at through the binoculars which actually caused me to become dazed after a few minutes of constantly watching it to the point that I needed a short break. It definitely wasn't an aircraft because it was too far away and because the pulsating colours were very different from the blinking lights of an aircraft i.e., the pulses were non-uniform and the colours de-localised.  I live under the flight path to Heathrow Airport, so I'm very familiar with aircraft and what they look like from all altitudes.  I wouldn't say it was a star because it was moving too fast across the sky and conversely it was too slow to be an aircraft. I thought, that maybe it was a satellite.  Anyway, the object was moving South at about 1 degree every 3 minutes.   I'd be interested to see if anyone else reports it.

As we began to watch, I had a feeling that the object was not in the same position it was when I had first seen it, unfortunately I could not be sure. I timed our study which lasted 17 minutes. Within this time we saw the object move in a manner I would describe as follows; far to slow for a plane, too high and in one position for too long to be a helicopter and too fast for a satellite.

PD)) Witnessed a bright, disk shaped object seen flying from the sky to the ground at at close range. (Photos Taken) I was driving west from Rochester on Rochester Rd toward Lake Springfield.  When I reached the stop sign, there was a very bright light shining inside my car.  It was like a spot light from a police car.  I looked behind me and did not see a police car or any other vehicle.  I looked up and saw an orange light in the sky that wasn’t moving. At a steady speed it came from a couple miles up to ground level in approximately 5 seconds.  It hovered over the ground about a 100ft away.  The craft looked like it was the length of a city bus.  I could see the grass moving as it rotated.  It stayed there for less than a minute. When it was at ground level the lights dimmed, and I could see the craft rotating horizontally like a wheel with blue colored lights blinking around it with white light coming off of it.  It turned brighter and the grass was moving faster. It lifted and turned about 80 degrees and took off about 3 times faster than it came down. As it took off, the craft was a very, very bright blue. The whole craft was shining brighter than a light bulb, more like magnesium burning. When it left, my radio started going nuts. It stopped working. My car wasn’t running. There wasn’t even a light on my tape adapter (for CD). This shows I didn’t even have the battery working. After the craft left, my car would not start for 1 minute. A minute later it came back on by itself and the radio did. I didn’t have to turn the key to start it. I was able to take pictures of the craft (with my cell phone) as it was coming in, when it landed, and when it took off. The whole event seemed to take place in less than five minutes. I am concerned that I felt fatigued when the ‘spotlight’ was on my car.  I also have very little recollection on how I was able to travel from the location the sighting took place in Rochester and ended up outside the Muni property by the lake.

I was driving towards the town in the morning. I saw the object somewhere between 08:45 and 08:50, I’m estimating around the 08:49 mark. It was a bright morning and the sky was very clear. As I drove I noticed a bright flash in the sky to my right. I looked up and saw a metallic saucer shaped object in the sky. Its surface was a very clean and shiny metallic colour. The sunlight hitting the far right end of the object was causing an occasional flash of light. The surface of the object shimmered slightly, though this could have been heat rising from my car’s engine. It was a cold morning, however, so I do not consider this to be very likely. I slowed down and watched the craft carefully. It travelled across the sky to my left. It travelled quite fast, a bit faster than a helicopter. It did not look very low in the sky. Estimating the distance between my car and the object it looked as if it was quite long. Possibly the size of a large truck. After moving across the sky for a minute or two it stopped. The stop was sudden, it did not slow down before it stopped. It remained stationary in the same spot for a further minute or so. The object then vanished. My sight of the object was not obscured by any roadside objects, nor were there any clouds in the sky around the object. I looked around the sky but could not find the object again. I was on the main road to the town. At the spot where I started to see it, the sides of the road did not have any tall trees or other objects that would obscure my sights. A little further on was a slight hill but the object in question was very high in the sky so the hill did not block my sight. I was the only person who saw the object. My sister was in the car with me but was reading at the time. I did not tell her about the object.

I was headed southbound on I-435, about 2 miles south of I-29, and at first I assumed this was a landing plane. It was much brighter than a plane, however, and it was ""pointed"" due north rather than east/northeast, which is the direction of the airport from this freeway.

We thought at first it was the moon behing some clouds unitl we realized we don't have clouds that looked like these vapor cloud things. The other clouds were not like it anyway. There was a brightness in the area surrounding this. We went inside because we were comming home and watched the bright cloud or vapor thing. There were at least 15 in the group. Two at a time they stared to fade. Some just got brighter then were gone and the others turned organgeish white and just shot away. This continued until the 15 were gone. Under the conglomeration was a line of the vapor type clouds it remained even after the others left. I called my neighbor during this time and she and her husband started to watch. I thought it was over and I contacted our local news to see if anyone had reported anything in the sky of course it hadn't. Then the line that had been there got a huge fireball on top of it and I realized that is also what I had seen in the sky that I thought was the moon. It looked like a sunrise but it was in the west and it exploded and disappeared. It took about 3-5 minutes for this to happen so it was watchable. Not like a split second that was what was so amazing. I was loudly asking my friend on the phone if she saw it and she did. The other little clouds under it did the same thing orangeish reddish explosion. But it really looked like they were taking off and they were so powerful and fast that it created that light. I wonder if the cloudy vapor things were a cover or that the  technology of the ships created the vapors. It was really the most incredible thing I have ever seen. I'm not the type of person who believes things easily and I even brushed it off when I first saw everything. But it was undeniable and fantastic. I wouldn't even allow myself to believe it at first thinking there must be a logical explaination. The only logical explaination is  alien life in our atsmosphere observing our planet.,2006-12-07T00:00:00,,

Inexplicable bright lights and moving objects,Texarkana,AR,2007-08-06T22:45:00,,,"Occurred : 8/6/2007 22:45 Reported: 8/7/2007 8:05:47 AM 08:05 Posted: 8/7/2007 Location: Texarkana (10 mi. S of), AR Shape:  Duration:",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58029.html,"Inexplicable bright lights and moving objects Event date: 08/06/2007 Time of occurrence: between 10:30 P.M. and 11:00 P.M. Location: Southwest Arkansas (approx. 10 miles south of Texarkana)   	A friend and I were sitting on his front patio conversing when over his shoulder I saw a somewhat red/white light appear above the horizon in the eastern/southeastern sky moving at a 45 degree angle and then the light became a series of 3-4 white rectangular lights that appeared in a stepwise fashion, each bright light burning for a second and fading.  My friend could tell from my reaction to the initial lights that something was unusual, so he turned in time to see the last couple of bright lights burning/fading.  We were astonished and confused.  He said, “Maybe it was fireworks.”  I disagreed.  Within seconds another series of 3-4 bright white rectangular lights burned in a periodic, stepwise manner further north in the sky.  This scenario continued with the lights sometimes burning at angles, thus appearing diamond shaped, sometimes flatter and rectangular.  One time the lights appeared and did not fade before the next appeared; this left an angled series of five or six bright, white, diamond-shaped lights that illuminated and faded in 2-3 seconds. 	Star-like points of light also appeared and remained illuminated for long stretches of time as they moved in random paths in the sky.  It was difficult to determine how many of these points of light were moving simultaneously in different parts of the night sky, but I would estimate four at one point.  The aforementioned large, bright, white lights seemed to originate from these point of light, which were like fast moving stars.  The points of light would change direction haphazardly.  I was watching one of these points of light that appeared in the direction of Cassiopeia and headed southward in the sky very quickly when my friend said there was another further south moving toward yet another one that was slowly moving, then seemed to become stationary as the other light approached it; these two lights converged and disappeared for a split second only to reappear as a single bright, white light that moved away very fast. 	 There were airplanes in the clear sky on this evening, and they were easy to distinguish with their flashing red lights and straight paths in the sky.  It was difficult to gauge the distance to these lights against the night sky, however the distance seemed significant from our perspective.  One of these starlike points moved so rapidly across the sky it had to have been moving extremely fast and been a little closer, but it was the tiniest pinpoint of light and still seemed quite a distance away.  We had an open view to much of the horizon, and the activity occurred in a range from the horizon to approximately 30-40 degrees above the horizon.  After we had witnessed a few of these lights I went upstairs to get my friend’s wife and her sister to have them witness these lights.  They stuck their heads out the upstairs window and saw a round and said, ""Cool,"" then returned to their movie, not as impressed as we were. 	My friend is an agriculture pilot in that area; I am a Registered Nurse, with multiple science degrees and way too many generic science classes taken over the years.  We are not crazy; we were not intoxicated; and I would hesitate to tell too many people.  But we did see these unusual things in the sky, and I am sure there’s some rational governmental explanation, and I would love to hear it!",2007-08-07T00:00:00,33.423,-93.8691

I live on the second floor of a two story appartment.  I had to smoke a cigarette, so I went to the balcony.  It was november in texas, so the wind was blowing pretty hard.  My balcony faces a large open area where the appartment swimming pool is located.   As I was lighting my cigarette, I noticed something coming from over the building on my right.  It was only about three or four feet wide and rectangular, almost a perfect square.  It had a dull red appearance.  It moved by me pretty fast only about twenty or so feet in front of me.  It looked like it came from over the building, it dipped down in front of me, and started rising pretty fast.   Normally, on a windy texas night i wouldn't have thought much about that, but it moved in a straight line, and was definately three dimensional.   As i mentioned before, it was moving pretty fast and flew by me as i was lighting my cig.  I kept watching it and it changed direction and started going skyward, again it was moving in a completly straight line.  Only once it got some altitude and some distance did it start to get a white glow to it, and i was able to follow it in the sky for quite awhile, definatly longer than i should have for an object of that size.   By this time i was trying to figure out what in Heavens name this thing was.  It couldn't have been paper, since in the wind paper wouldn't have kept its shape, and plus it was a complete square.  It couldn't have been a box, since the wind wasn't THAT strong, and again it would have been knocked around instead of moving in a straight line.  Plus, boxes don't glow.   As i mentioned before, i followed it for quite awhile, i smoked the majority of my cigarette watching it, and then it just dissappeared.   I noticed a plane was in the sky on an intercept course to the object, and when it dissapeared, the plane changed course.   I live near an Air Force base and i wonder if the plane was a military plane. If anyone has had a similar experiance, I would like to hear about, partly just to confirm my sanity.

Its relative position to the jet was rearward and to the left, (from my perspective). I brought it to the attention of the other two people with me.  It appeared to be stationary. It was round in shape, metallic. It was very silvery and shiny. It remained stationary, and then after a short time, it began to pace the aircraft.  But, the jet slowly gained distance, as the UFO was traveling at a slower speed.  It remained off to one side and rearward of the aircraft as it moved.  I had enough time to gain access to my garage and retrieve a pair of binoculars.  I observed the object through binoculars for perhaps 30 seconds. It was definately round, perhaps ""ball-like"".  I was able to definately observe that there were no wings or other protrusions.   On what would appear to be the bottom were two lights.  One was large and white and very bright.  I mean very bright! The other was much smaller and red.  The shape was very discernable through the binoculars, and WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE OR JET!,  It was round.

Living in Albuquerque we are used to seeing aircraft, including the stealth fighter every now and then and the occasional air show. To us, lights in the sky are quite common.  However, on this night (tonight) we were driving home from the gym and as we turned down and adjacent street from the main road on our way home I saw two objects racing *fast* on a SE to NW direction.  No biggie, right, except these things were traveling really quickly across the sky in tandem.  I stopped the vehicle and pointed the objects out to my uncle.  We continued to drive around the corner (and had to to keep it in our sights). Here is the kicker... The object forward most was a cobalt bright blue glow. We thought is was an afterburner of a jet. But wait...following behind was another craft which had identifying FAA blinking lights. The light was red so we figured it was the starboard light that was flashing. The craft were equidistant from each other and by that I mean that the craft following or *chasing* the blue sphere didn't gain any ground nor lose any ground. As the craft flew out of sight, the blue cobalt sphere faded. We think this is because is was moving out of range of vision. The other continued to fade, too, meaning that the flashing red FAA light got dimmer and dimmer as it moved away from us. We had second thoughts on the afterburner glow as the craft following was keeping pace and did not show afterburner glow as one might expect. Also, the sphere did not have any identifying FAA flashing lights. It was a constant color and did not flicker. It is our belief that the former object was one of our (USA) jets. Neither took off from the airport as their trajectory was not that of a departing plane. We heard no sound of any kind and felt both objects were low enough to have been heard as they passed. They were about a 30 to 35 degree angle from our juxtaposition to the horizon. It was a crystal clear night and, NO, these weren't stars as stars do not fly across the sky at these speeds. There were no tree's obstructing our view and in fact we had to drive forward several times in order to avoid any objects such as houses and trees.  Basically, we were able to keep it within our sights with little trouble. There were not tails like that of a ""shooting star or comet.""",2007-03-08T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

I said ""hand me the binoculars!  hand me the binoculars!"" but was too dumbstruck to look away to grab them, even though J was holding them out to me (her eyes also locked on the triangle).  I watched it for about 4 or 5 seconds until it disappeared in the haze of light pollution to the south.  As far as our backgrounds, we are both in our early thirties, I work at a video game studio and she is an independent web designer.  I'm pretty agnostic when it comes to inexplicable phenomena, but pretty much rule out interstellar travel, aliens walking among us, etc etc.  But this crazy thing tonight was definitely, definitely, definitely nothing like anything I've ever seen before.  We are both pretty stunned right now.",2007-08-14T00:00:00,37.99526143250689,-122.52110826446282

We were in Chelmsford, Essex, which is in the South-East of the UK. Apparently out of nowhere, three large dots appeared in the sky. They looked large -- apparently at least ten times the size of stars *in terms of perception* -- although they weren't terribly bright. They formed the three points of an equilateral triangle, and they moved quickly -- over the space of about five seconds -- away over the horizon and out of sight. There was nothing visible between the dots, although background stars were blocked out, according to my friend. I myself was less aware of this observation at the time, so I'm not sure whether I've unfairly re-evaluated what I thought I saw. Today I have looked to the internet in an effort to see if such a sight is usual. I came across descriptions of BBDs, which appear to match what my friend and I saw. I should stress that I had never been aware of these before (unless, perhaps from films, of course). Thousands of Brits will have been looking up at the skies that night because of the meteor shower that received a huge amount of press attention in its run-up. I'd be fascinated to know whether others saw what my friend and I did. Ben",2007-08-14T00:00:00,,

We were 15 miles Northwest of a very small community(Hazelton ND) laying out on the bed of my truck out in the hills on a prairie trail, when my girlfriend pointed out a small object a little larger than a majority of the stars around us soaring through the night sky.  I explained that it was just a satellite no big deal, she insisted that it was going to fast, but I stuck by my satellite explanation.  10 mins. later she started talking about this object she had been keeping tabs on, for a moment I couldn't see what she was pointing at, she said the object turned, I didn't see it because I didn't realize how dramatic it's course change was, once I had spotted it, I knew it wasn't a normal sighting.  The object had moved almost directly in front of our field of view and was moving from side to side, and then it would stop hover and begin to move diagonally across the sky, and than in an obscure figure eight pattern, then stop again and hover, it was very bizarre.  We watched it for 15 mins. or so, and decide to head back to the ranch, by the time we reached the farmstead, stopped, and got back out on the bed of the truck the object was gone, we watched for over a half an hour before my girlfriend was to creeped out to stick around out there anymore.  I don't know what that object was, but it gave the feeling that it was almost watching us, the way it would stop and hover out amongst the stars, and then to disappear like that within a 5 min. drive back to the house.  It creeped us out.",2007-08-14T00:00:00,,

The object appeared to have a soft orange glow about its perimeter as well as around the orbs.  The event only took about 5-8 seconds to occur & what we found most stunning was the fact that it was absolutely silent as it traveled. We live somewhat near the airport & hear a lot of air traffic. This object however was perfectly silent & given the late hour, there wasn’t a lot of ambient noise in the neighborhood.  In the time it took the two of us who witnessed the event to simultaneously say, “what was that!?!?” the object disappeared behind a large tree in our yard & was gone.

The pictures are eerily similar (drawings submitted separately).

This morning several other officers and myself observed an odd phenomenon.  What we saw appeared to us to be some sort of cloud which upon closer examination appeared to be some sort of flying craft hidden or, to use a term from Star Trek, ""cloaked,"" so as to be unseen. Before we are laughed off as nuts, let me explain the whole story as it happened:   It was around 8:00 AM and was the morning count time and I was a dorm officer.  My dorm partner and myself counted ""A"" side of the dorm. Then as she went through the ""cube"" in the middle of the dorm to go through to the other side I went outside to go along the sidewalk to the other side to count. As I was walking along I felt a sudden blast of wind or breeze and felt sand stinging my face. I thought; What in the world? It is a nice day, where did that come from?  I looked in the direction of ""B"" Dorm and saw a low wall of dust coming towards me as if propelled by some unseen force and when it hit me I had to shield my face and eyes.  It was not really a high wind, but just propelled along by some force other than high wind if that makes any sense and when it hit me it felt very cold or extremely cool. I looked up to check the sky wondering if some storm was blowing in out of nowhere. But to my amazement the sky was mostly clear, but something immediately caught my eye when I looked up.  A dark sort of a dirty grey cloud tinged in pink was going over at a good clip.   But what struck me as odd was not only the fact that it was close to the ground, maybe a couple of hundred yards, but that it was going along at a fast pace, much faster than a normal cloud, even in a storm, but also that it was shaped so funny.  I wondered about such a strange looking, lonely storm cloud to be skipping across the country side at such a good speed all by itself in an otherwise clear sky?!? 	  As I stood and stared at it for a moment as it flew along over the ""camp"" (slang name for a prison) it I noticed a group of officers, ""Yard Rovers,"" standing in the prison yard a hundred yards away watching it intently also. I then turned and went on into the dorm to continue our count. But others watched it until it was out of site (see below). But it was shaped so funny that it stuck in my mind for the next few hours and sort of worried me like something nagging at the back of your mind. It was as I said a dirty, very dark grey like a storm cloud and had a pinkish tint in places, especially along the underside. It was not shaped like any cloud that I have ever seen. It was almost like a big wedge the size of two or three houses end to end, the pointed or narrow end to the front, the aft end sort of flat or squared. And above this aft end was a section of it, of ""cloud "",  that was sort of like a diamond or triangular shape, almost reminding one of the tail section of a rocket or plane. All along it and especially the aft end of it were sort of like tendrils hanging along being tugged at by the air as it went along, as if the vapors were being sucked off by the passing air or wind and being constantly rejuvenated.  Sort of like, if one can imagine it, a block of dry ice flying along with its vapors enfolding around it and flitting around and from it with the wind.  That stuck in the back of my mind about how it looked to me. Then a bit later a single word came to me, ""artificial!""  That was what I was trying to think of , what was nagging at me!  It had almost an artificial look to it!!  Maybe I have been a ""Trekky"" too many years, studying space travel, reading up on and being a fan of things like ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek.""   But the terminology on Star Trek used for the technology for a space ship to able to hide from radar and from visionary detection, basically being able to become invisible at will, is called a ""Cloaking Device!""  Something similar is what the United States was trying to perfect with the ""Philadelphia Experiment"" during WWII. That experiment failed as far as I know and cost the military some lives. But not wanting to be laughed at I kept all these thoughts, uneasy feelings, and observations to my self for fear of being ridiculed. But as it turns out I was not the only one who had witnessed it! 	  Later, as the day was winding down, and I having forgotten it,  three of the yard rovers stopped in our dorm on their rounds and sat down to take a slight pause, or break, to rest their feet and began going on about something..  It dawned on me that they were chattering about the same thing I had seen!  But they had more to tell;  One commented on the coldness that hit them, and how without any real high wind a wall of slight debris and sand came at them also, sort of along of and in front of this so called ""cloud.""  They agreed that it was sort of like the ""fore blast"" in front of a helicopter or hover craft of some sort, but not as violently thrown as a helicopter does.  Someone else asked if anyone else noticed the orange plastic barrier to the construction area sort of just wrinkle up and roll up and over into a ditch, but with no real high wind to make it do so, just that sort of uncanny cold air and slight breeze that went along in front of the ""cloud."" One officer was asking did the rest of us notice how the so called cloud, or cloudlike substance around it,  kept folding in on itself, sort of like renewing itself or something.  Another officer said that she thought from the beginning that it was some sort of secret, or even alien, craft in some sort of disguise and that when it went on over them she intently tried to look at the back of it to see if there was the ""back"" or aft end of some sort of craft visible.  She said that the cloud, or vapors, just boiled down and over the back of it hiding the rear end, with the same tendrils of vapor or cloud that I had seen trailing behind it.   And then they all agreed very excitedly that when it went over and across the open area of the prison that the ""fore blast"" of breezy dust and all preceded it and when it crossed over a tree line of tall trees the tops of those trees went crazy jiggling and swaying very fast back and forth, and as soon as it passed this movement ceased.  	   That last bit of info sort of puts me in mind of the reports that at so called UFO landing sites it has been found that the molecular structure of plant material in the area had been changed or altered! 	  One of the rovers said that he had been going to the Back-Gate at the time to let in the ""Farm Squad"" inmates. He chimed in and said that he had seen the same thing and now that he thought of it he agreed with all that they said. And he said that when he let the farm squad inmates in the Farm Boss asked him did he see that odd looking cloud flying fast across the camp?  This Farm Boss more or less saw and felt the same things too.  Of course by then I had chimed in with what I saw, my observations, and my feelings. 	  One of the officers, who is very interested in science, space travel, etc, as I am asked,""Officer Edelen, did you get the definite feeling that it was a craft of some kind, somehow ""Cloaked"" or in some kind of disguise?  I readily agreed and we all more or less agreed that whether it was an alien UFO of some sort of a top secret craft of the United States, it gave us all the impression that it was a craft of some sort in some sort of disguise.  I of course even commented that I had read reports of alien craft that were not of solid material atoll but were known as some sort of plasma craft, possibly craft capable of traveling inter-dimensionally. 	  It does indeed appear to have been just that; some sort of artificial anomaly, or some sort of craft: One;  it was flying too fast,  Two;  it kept a set course until out of site,  and Three; it retained it shape until it was out of site.  And Four; one officer commented that she had studied its shadow for a moment.  She said the shape she had seen was not the obscured shape of an edgeless or uneven edged cloud but the definite shape of a hard craft of some sort. 	  And then they all agreed that they had seen  three Air Force jets, one behind the other, flying way up above the ""cloud"" but along the exact same course as if they were following it, hunting it, or possibly monitoring it.  At that time we called Channel 12 news and asked if anyone had reported seeing anything strange in the skies over Elmore, Autauga counties. The guy I spoke to said that at that time they had received no such reports. 	 	  Now these officers that saw this: I have right at14 years in with the Alabama Department of Corrections, and the others on up to near 20 yrs and over.  They all three are mature men and women and very serious, professional Correctional Officers, not given to flights of fancy and delusion and are trained both by not only APOST Certified Correctional Training but also by the training and intuition that years of service gives you to spot anything unusual and out of the ordinary and keep a level head while doing so, and to be able to mentally keep notes while doing so. And to top it all off this evening a 2nd shift supervisor called me at my home asking about the ""sighting,"" that some of our 1st shift officers that were working overtime on his shift had commented on seeing what we saw along with several inmates. I told him what we saw and he concurred saying that is what others there had told him.

I noticed it about 11 pm while watching for a reported meteor shower expected.  I noticed at first it was entremely bright. Then noticed that an obvious commercial aircraft seemed to be heading for it.  The questioned unidentified aircraft ""flashed"" lights at the commercial aircraft and the commercial aircraft veered away to an entirely different direction of travel. I got out binoculars and looked closer at the unknown ""light"" in the sky and realized it was NOT something normal.  It appeared to be cigar or saucer shaped with 4 very bright lights acroos.  Occasionally the lights would dim to the point of being not visible to the naked eye. While observing thru the binoculars I observed that when this happened, the lights on the craft would change shape becoming shaped like a blackslash which grew more and more narrow, over a period of several seconds.  Then the lights would open fully again becoming very very bright. I watched this aircraft for approximately 2 1/2 hours.  During this time NO airplanes whatsoever flew over, which is quite unusual because this is a normal regularly busy flight path for San Francisco airport as well as San Jose. The craft simply hovered there in place.  There has NEVER been anything shaped even similarly in the sky, there is no way this could have been an airplace, helicopter, nothing commonly known. I called my brother, who lives several miles closer to the approximate estimated spot the craft was hovering.  He went outside and IMMEDIATELY spotted it and said, oh *hit, I think we are in trouble.  He too observed the lights on it changing but described that as a ""sweeping"" function, as tho the craft were searching around it's perimiter, then would return to the simple hovering state. I noticed my cell phone reception was very poor during this time - background noise, static, bleedover noise.

Then I saw it again but it was a bright light again moving in the opposite direction. Then I really started looking at it and it was moving back and forth in the sky, when the object was moving fast it was blinking a reddish color, when it slowed down and was moving more in a straight line than curving upwards that’s when the light would get extremely bright and more of a white light.  There were also cats; I saw at least three to four different cats walk across during the experience.  Another one of my employees came out and then we started taking pictures. When we zoomed in on the picture it was an oval shape. I didn’t see the object disappear but it did go behind trees until I couldn’t see it anymore. I talked to one of the witnesses the next morning and he said he saw it again on the way home that night, but that it was closer to him.

It was definitely moving faster than a plane, or helicopter, and the way it slowed down, and how the lights were moving on it- there was at least three different lights on this object.

I was making a quick run to the store to pick up a few items and my three children,  15, and 11, asked to stay in the car with our two large dogs to watch lightening way off in the east.  When I came out about 10 minutes later they pointed out a star, but said, it could not be a star because it was blinking different colored lights. I saw it very far off, and it was indeed changing color, blinking, but I could not discern whether it might have been a satellite or a plane.  When we got home, we took a closer look at it-- it was NOT MOVING AT ALL, it was BLINKING red, white and green. BLINKING. Location was due north, towards Boise. We inspected the sky and I spotted a second object in the north east. Same... stationery, blinking colors, level in height with the other.  22:10 I (the adult mother, 49 yrs old) can verify 4 objects. Another daughter, 14 years old spotted five. THE MOST DISTINCTIVE IS IN THE NORTHEAST AND IS VERY CLEAR.  I have called a friend who has a telescope. He has called back and has verified sighting one object. He is a medical doctor and an excellent source. He cannot see any of the others as his property is obstructed by trees. We are considering that they may be stars, and the atmosphere may be causing the color change, but we are both skeptical.

The object was moving at a very high rate of speed from south to north. The object was visible as a bright light that was behind or in the clouds. I've seen meteors/shooting stars before, but I don't think they would have been this visible through the cloud cover. The object itself was only visible as a glowing white light in the sky, due to the clouds I could see no shape except for the light itself which was circular in shape. There was a glow of light around the object that was nearly three to four times the size of the actual light itself, but I suspect that this was due to the clouds. The object did not change course or move from a straight line and I quickly lost sight of it as it went behind some trees that line the street.

I went to my basement to retrieve a fan as it was a warm night and is expected to be in the '90's today. When I looked for the light again a couple of minutes later in the west and then in the east it was gone. I then wondered if this may be why my normally quiet inside dog was woofing last night?",2006-07-16T00:00:00,42.1616,-84.0238
"Unidentified Object East Of Christchurch, New Zealand.",Christchurch (New Zealand),,2006-07-13T08:45:00,rectangle,20 seconds,"Occurred : 7/13/2006 08:45  (Entered as : 07/13/06 8:45) Reported: 7/16/2006 5:13:22 AM 05:13 Posted: 7/16/2006 Location: Christchurch (New Zealand),  Shape: Rectangle Duration:20 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51369.html,"Unidentified Object East Of Christchurch, New Zealand. I was standing on my parents’ outside deck last week (13th or 14th of July, 2006) at approximately 8:45 a.m. New Zealand time.  Unfortunately, I cannot be exact about the date because I was there on both days but it was definitely either the 13th or the 14th.  My parents’ house is on a hill in Christchurch, a small city situated on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. The house faces north but also affords excellent views to the east and part of the west due to the fact that it is built on a reasonably high cliff-face.  I had gone outside to have a cigarette when I noticed a moderately large sea bird gliding gracefully across the sky on an upward current of wind.  I mention this detail only because of what the observation led to.  The bird swooped up higher than I normally look and as I followed it with my eyes I noticed a strange and very small object very high in the eastern sky.  I was immediately intrigued due to the fact that in the 35 years I have stood on that outside deck I have never once seen an aircraft at either that height or position.  I have seen thousands of planes from that deck throughout my life.  Most travel in a broadly north or north-eastern direction as they travel up the coast and the ones that head south or west are usually obscured from view.  To see a plane in the eastern sky well off the eastern coast of the South Island of New Zealand is very unusual as there is basically nothing but the Pacific Ocean all the way to South America.  As I have already mentioned, the object was very high in the sky; certainly higher than any plane I’ve ever seen.  In fact, I would never normally crane my neck back so severely if I hadn’t been watching the sea bird’s arc. I remember thinking to myself ""Is this a large object far away or a small object somewhat closer,"" and I felt without hesitation that it was the former. I have excellent eyesight and I am convinced that what I saw was neither a conventional aircraft nor a weather balloon.  In shape, the object was rectangular more than anything and seemed to be slightly reflecting the morning sunlight as it moved upward and away. There was a thin layer of high cloud above and the object steadily climbed through it (or appeared to) and disappeared slowly over the course of around 20 seconds. It moved at a very gradual pace and had no other distinguishing characteristics. I must reiterate that the object was very small to the naked eye and that my gut feeling was that it was a very long way above me. The reflective nature of the object suggested to me that it may have been of metallic origin.  I want to stress the unusual nature of this sighting. I have never seen anything like it in 35 years. My initial assumption was that it must have been the space shuttle but I have not been able to establish whether it would have been viewable at this time and date from my location.  I’d love to know what that strange object was!",2006-07-16T00:00:00,,

I was laying down on my lawn looking up at the stars and wondering about how nice it would be if the city removed the street lamp from in front of my house that way there wouldn't be that glare interferring with my view of the stars when I saw an unlit object traveling north.  At first I thought it was a balloon but it was traveling too fast and too straight for a balloon, plus there was no wind blowing at all for it to be a balloon traveling that fast. I started thinking maybe it was just a rock formation of some sort floating through the sky because surely if it was an aircraft I would have seen some sort of light. It was very faint but I could barely pick it out with my vision and there is no doubt in my mind that it was moving. I called my wife but she couldn't hear me so I decided not to tell her afterall for she might think I was nuts. Plus when my focus returned to the object I could not longer find it in the dark sky. But soon after I saw another (I would say 10 minutes after). I chirped my friend on the Nextel and luckily he was on the line immediately. I chirped him because he is the type of guy who has a telescope for the stars and is all in to aircrafts and knows about Astronomy somewhat. I told him what I had seen and asked him to check the sky. Of course nothing else could be seen for a while until I seen another to the east of where I was at and I couldn't pinpoint the coordinates to him from my house in time for him to see it. Realize that after a minute or so it became lost in the haze of the darkness. I was trying to explain to him to where the object was in relation to certain bright stars but it was difficult to explain since I know nothing of Astronomy. I thought Orion was out and according to him the 3 stars I was looking at was not Orion so we were lost for a while. Until we established two points of reference in the sky the 3 stars which I thought was Orion was the secondpoint and the first point was the brightest star to the East with two faint stars which sort of formed a triangle. So time passed and eventually he had a couple of friends visit him and I could hear them in the background and then like at 10:30ish I saw another object, also traveling north that coincidently was crossing right by the first point of reference which we had established and that was the brightest star to the East of the second point of reference. This one however we both saw. I chirped him on the Nextel and asked him to look at the first reference point and apparently all the guys who were with him also looked up at that exact time and saw what I had been seeing, except this was the fourth one that I had seen and only their first. One of the other guys that was there said immediately that it was a satellite. And they unanimously agreed that it must have been a satellite but I still had my doubts. The fourth one did something different than the first 3. Since the fourth one passed right through my first point of reference (the brightest star)the object seemed to get brighter as it passed right by the point of reference. It seemed to reflect the brightness of that star and as it passed it the darkness began to swallow it up as it again grew fainter and fainter and finally disappeared. We then began a big discussion on satellites and the speed they travel and how many there are as if we knew what we were talking about and to make a long story short I still have my doubts because I could not Identify this object, thus making it a UFO for me. If you could identify it then I guess it will no longer be a UFO but the fact is I saw what I saw. That's it. I hope my info could help solve other mysteries or clear misconceptions.

My house is about 250 meters (273 yards) from the shore. This was not a red light from an airplane's navigation lights. This red light would get very intense and then would grow dimmer but wouldn't entirely disappear, unlike an airplane's red navigation light which basically seem to blink. This was not an airplane, I'm very certain of that. Planes crossing the Atlantic, arriving at Lisbon's International Airport usually do their approach exactly over the area where I live so I'm very used to watching them and I recognize their navigation lights. I can say for certain that it wasn't a (conventional) plane because the light was completely different, it was much lower than a plane, and it crossed the sky alot quicker than a plane, as it completely disappeared from my sight in about 1-2 minutes. At the time of the sighting there wes a civilian plane on the sky, so besides the obvious differences I also had real time comparison with an actual plane. I called the Portuguese Air Force 30 minutes after the sighting and told them what I had seen, and they were very helpful and asked me the (I assume) usual questions: estimated altitude of the object, duration of the sighting, etc. and told me they would get back to me. They did, 10 minutes after that, and the person told me he had contacted civilian and military airtraffic controllers and they didn't saw anything on radar.

While heading back going west on Bollinger Canyon Road, the object appeared to keep pace with us.  We then headed north on Dougherty Valley Road, then west on Crow Canyon Road, toward Danville.  The object kept pace with us; it was at a fairly high distance, so we could not determine its shape.  While in Danville, going south on Brookside Drive, I again spotted this flashing red and white object.  As we turned a corner, still on Brookside Drive, this object turned, lowered its elevation, and headed toward us.  At this point, we realized it was heading straight toward us.  We became frightened and as this object came closer, I turned my car around and headed back, north, down Brookside Drive.  My son stated to me later that ""if you threw a frisbee into the air at this thing, it would have hit it.""  At the point in which I was turning our car around in a driveway to get away from this thing, my son was able to see the object up close, from the passenger side.  He states this object had one blue light on the one end, and rotating red and white lights all around at the bottom.  He states it was circular and 'HUGE,' although could not explain to me how many feet in circumference it seemed to be.

We drove in the same pattern as I had taken previously, then headed back home.  We didn't see anything during that time.  As we were headed toward home, I took a street called Monarch Drive and decided to go up Monarch Drive, which is on a hill, overlooking the Valley.  We were headed east.  We got out of our car and saw three objects, each had flashing red and white lights.  We were not able to see their shapes, but noted that they at times would just hover, and/or move very quickly, first right, then left.  Eventually, we headed back off Monarch, onto Bollinger Canyon Road, going west.  As we headed home, we noted that two of these objects were now pacing us, one in front of the other.  All of a sudden, the object behind the other picked up speed and literally flew over the object in front of it, seemingly missing the object in front of it by inches.

I took another 90 degree turn and once again it maintained a parallel flight pattern. I then took another 90 degree turn and it followed behind at a fixed distance. I repeated the rectangular pattern of travel and the light maintained an equal distance. At this point I drove straight in an attempt to outdistance the light and it grew smaller indicating that it was in fact flying relatively close to the surface.  I continued direction of travel and light grew dim, but when I made a 90 degree turn I noticed the light maintained a parallel flight pattern albeit at a greater distance than before.

The cloud looked flat, was vertically oriented, and had perfectly straight sides, and was diamond shaped.  My first thought was that it was some kind of huge kite.  I  looked at it through a spotting scope, and could tell that it was clearly a cloud.  Then I noticed a round object above the cloud, which my wife could see without the scope, and through the scope it had a frisbee shape, with what looked like a hole in the center. The object looked solid, and had clearly defined edges. It began to move downward, extremely slowly, and changed it's orientation so that it looked almost edge on to our viewpoint, then went behind some low hills just south of the Superstition Mtns.  This took place over maybe 2-3 minutes, and while this was happening, the cloud kind of disentegrated into a more or less normal cloud looking shape, and drifted slightly north of where we first saw it.  At this time my wife had to leave for work, and I went back in the house, where I continued looking at this cloud through the scope.  Then another cloud appeared very suddenly, in about the same place.  It appeared to be more edge on, and looked more like a slash, but I could see that it had the same square edged appearance as the first one.  As I was looking at it, a small round piece of it slowly bulged out of the side, near the bottom, and began the same slow drifting kind of descent the first one did.  Thia one however didn't have a definite shape, it just looked like a small piece of cloud, trailing cloud/steam/smoke/? in a very short tail behind it.  It also finally went out of sight behind the hills in about the same place as the first one, and the cloud disentegrated in about the same manner as the first.  Before this second one disappeared, a third cloud appeared, in jus! t about the same place, with the same thing coming out of it.

And then the trees blocked my veiw. I immediatly told my girlfriend. She kinda got excited and wanted to see. So I told her toward to look toward Travis(AFB). We hit a couple corners toward the house and had an open view and no fireworks... So we get into my apartment parking lot and shes still looking back for the fireworks. And I notice a red light in the sky straight infront of us while I was driving toward my parking space. My girlfriend tells me... ""Do you see that?"" I replyed with a confirmed face and nod. ""What is that?"" It looked to be a ""Red Star"" very bright. Like a dot or light. I hit a corner in my parking lot and parked to get out to look. There it is... a weird red star looking thing. So I call a homeboy accross town to instruct him to go outside and look toward my apartments. This is around 11:50pm He does and laughs. ""What is that?"" No Clue. A red light shining in the sky. Shortly after I called him the red dot started pulsing.. Slowing... But pulsing. Bright and Dim. While I was on the phone with him a white light came from the middle of the red dot and shot BRIGHT real fast and a white line traced down from the bottom. It looked like a white tracer bullet but shot out and only went a very short distance away from the bottom of the red light. I was still on the phone with my homie and he had 3 people with him that all seen it. After the white light shot down, it was once again solid red. I then noticed it was moving down slowly. I got off the phone with my friend and then my girlfriend cal! led her mother. Told her and she had 3 other people with her. We all seen it there are 9 of us in 3 different parts of town. When it dissapered it started moving to the right and then started to pulse faster but still slow.(Maybe  each about 700ms"") and then did the same thing the white tracer line thing did and shot down about an inch in my eyes and dimmed away with a consistant pulse. It all happend for about 10 minutes It stopped about midnight to the minute. What I think happend if it was an alien =P. Is that of course they would be smart and they wouldnt go into lightspeed parallel from us. They would go away from us... Please reply!!!1",2006-12-07T00:00:00,38.26628125,-122.04649967105263

I keep hearing a very strange, un-natural noise coming from oustide. When i first hear something, it sounded as if a large, heavy object was bouncing outside on the street. It ceased only a minute later. Shortly after this happened, not even 10 minutes later, i heard something else. This was a very strange noise as well. I can compare it to so few things. I could tell by the sound that it was high in the air, much like you can a jet. But this sound was stationary, possibly 10-15 feet to the side of my house. The best why i can describe it is that of a jet engine, with a waving sound. The almost hovering noise would pulse in and out. It sounded like a jet had stopped moving, and the engine was turning off and on very quickly.. i do not know how to put it. Than while i was hearing this, i heard the bouncing noise again, this time on the side of the house. This stopped quickly again, than the jet like sound trailed off as well. I have not yet went outside.. it is 2:08 am, and i am feeling quite uneasy about this. What ive just said may not seem like a UFO, but it is not the first time i have seen or heard something. I will describe this quickly as it may help to find out what happened. This event occured many years ago, possibly 6 years. I was younger, and across the street from my house with my brother, and his friend. There is a long drive way leading away from their farm, which we were riding are bikes down. it was very dark, and getting late, possibly 11pm. When the three of us got to the end of the drive way, we all stared at an object hoving over a field, maybe 1/2 a mile away. it was a very large disk/saucer shaped object, with long sides, there were also lights on the sides of it. I remember this very clearly. It may sound like a hoax, or something different from a UFO. But it was very clear for how dark it was. And i know it was not an airplane, helicopter, weather balloon.. nothing like that. We were kind of frightened by th! is so we turned around and rode back to the house. I tired to tell my parents.. but they did not believe us. I would really like to be contacted about this via my email address. Have similar sound been reported?",2006-12-07T00:00:00,40.721,-75.7038

On the night of November 30, midnight to be exact.  We were travelling from Tucson to Rocky Point.  After we pass Sells, AZ, we started to see a pair of very bright amber lights and around them 4 white bright intermintent lights that seem to be from airplanes. When we stopped, we were able to hear noise from military jets, then we assumed it came from the white lights.  The amber lights desapeared after two minutes.  The jets appeared to be looking for them but could not find anything; suddenly, in the middle of the jets, three huge amber lights reappeared, and a cat and mouse game between the amber lights and the military jets started, 4 minutes later all lights desappeared. We continued our trip and when we were 20 miles from Why, AZ, the amber lights appeared over a mountain close to Ajo; they were in the for about 5 minutes.  My friend stopped the car and I stepped out of the car to record with a small digital camera; a few minutes later, another light appeared next to the one on the right side.  When the lights were changing direction in the sky they were leaving a gray streak behind them but it's not appreciated in the video. My friend shut off the car, and the lights started to fade, at that moment the military jets (I suppose) reappeared. Later when we were travelling from Why to Lukeville, we still could notice that the lights were behind the mountains near Ajo; furthermore, when we passed Sonoita, already in the Mexican side and we were travelling to Rocky Point, we could still the lights for 5 more minutes. The amber lights always faded when the military jets approached them. If someone knows the answer to this event, I'd like to know what it is, because it seemed very strange and thrilling at the same time.",2006-12-14T00:00:00,32.1595,-112.6223

There were planes coming in and even flying below this object but the object was stationary for about 20 minutes when it was first noticed.  At one point it seemed like it was flying in the same direction, parallel to the plane but then it stopped.  It just stayed in place.  Afterwards it started to move south.  Still it was not moving as fast as the airplanes passing (en route to Newark or La Guardia).  It was also much higher than the airplanes because it only looked like a bright white line.  After a few minutes moving south it stopped again.  Then it became the shape of a ball.  A bright white ball and then started moving Northwest towards the beach.  Then when it was over land it looked like it had a long straight gray extension which didn't shine bright like the bright white ball shaped light it was attached to.  Maybe it was a satellite.  I don't know, but it was odd.  Also from the angle I was seeing this, it didn't look like it was at the same altitude as the airplanes because it was higher, looked smaller, and the planes sometimes passed below it.  This object didn't make any noise.  You could hear the planes approaching and if you didn't hear them, you could see the white trails behind.

My wife and I were walking our dogs, heading due east.  The sky was very dark, and we had a nice view of the Milky Way.  Cassiopeia was clearly visible, although it was very difficult to make out Andromeda, due to its closeness to the horizon, and the lights of Champaign.  As I was walking the dogs, I noticed a white light go on then off in Cassiopeia, about ½ way between the two stars that form the wide “top” portion of the “W”.  At first I thought I had seen a lightning bug (firefly), so I kept watching to see if it happened again: it did.  This time it was a little further south, but still, keeping parallel to the Cassiopeia “W”.  The light would come on for about ¼-1/2 second, then go out.  It was not a quick on/off, but there was some ramping up and down of the amplitude.  It almost seemed as though it was rotating or something.  The on/off nature reminded me of a lightning bug, but it clearly was not that since it maintained a very consistent path in the sky relative to Cassiopeia, even though we moved about ¼ mile during our observations.  It “flashed” about 8 times or so before stopping.  We estimate it was traveling about 1 to 2 degrees per minute.

I looked down to configure my camera on the settings I wanted it on and then turned it off I then looked up to see a light that was brighter than anything else in the sky.  I compared the light to stars in the area and also a plane that I had seen moments before and it was way brighter than anything.  It then got even brighter than in initially was to begin with and slowly started to move to the right. I began to get my camera ready when the light slowly began to dim out until it disappeared into seemingly nowhere. I looked around the area but could see absolutely nothing else in the area the only things I could see were stars in the sky and nothing else.  It was a very weird encounter and reminded me of the ""Phoenix Lights"" that have been seen over Arizona State, USA for many years now.  But my eventful night was not over just yet, at 5 minutes past midnight I looked up at the sky this time in the opposite direction of the first light this light was much different to the bright one this light was quite dim and looked like an ordinary star but the difference was the object was moving very slowly across the sky I estimate at around 3MPH the object was very small and I got my video camera ready but the light was just not bright enough and I could not see the light in the viewfinder and then the light just disappeared and could no longer be seen.

The object had no discernable shape or size (but must have been somewhat large due to its apparent distance from our location). It was very bright white, or blue-white, or orange, or red-white in color; which constantly changed in no particular order or sequence, and continuously varied in intensity.  The light intensity of this object was at least an order of magnitude higher than that of any current aircraft landing or taxi lighting system I am familiar with, and the object was observed traveling away from our location, therefore, by comparison, landing and/or taxi lights would not be very apparent, if this object was a landing aircraft traveling away from us. In addition, the familiar blinking of aircraft position lights was not present at all.  We watched the object from an initial distance of approximately 4 miles and approximately 15000 feet AGL (which seemed to vary somewhat), as it traveled away from us from east to west, for about ¾ of an hour. The height AGL of the object was approximately constant (about 15000 feet); therefore, after ¾ of an hour, the object was about 16 miles away. The most disturbing aspect of this object (and the character that caught and held my attention) was its ‘amorphous’ nature. We viewed this object for almost an hour, mostly through field glasses and a high powered camera lens, and were struck by the constant change of its shape, size, color and position. The experience was disturbing for us, since we could not explain its behavior. However, if the flight path is extrapolated on a map, it does come close to Ft. Hood, TX.  Perhaps the object was a new military aircraft undergoing flight qualification testing?",2007-02-24T00:00:00,,

As I got to the dam, the lights had only moved a bit to the south, no more so that I was still looking up about 45-50 degrees over the horizon.  It was no where near going behind the horizon or the mountains here.   But, the lights both went out and I could not see any craft, or lights any more.

I was running late for work and I wasn’t paying much attention to the sky as I headed to an elevated train station.  But I had just missed my train as I was climbing the stairs to the platform, at around 5:52 p.m., I knew I was definitely going to be late, because I had to be at work at 6, so I decided to relax since I was going to be late anyway.   I walked to the middle of the platform, which is my favorite spot because there’s an open lot behind the station and a clear view of the sky.  I listened to my MP3 player for a few minutes and for some reason I decided to turn east and face that open parking lot, this was probably at 5:56 p.m. When I did I noticed a round brightly lit ball just sitting in the sky.  The lights didn’t blink.  So at first I thought it was a plane, because I wasn’t expecting to see something different than that.  I soon realized that it definitely wasn’t a plane because it was dark outside.  Although planes have lights that are visible at night their frames aren't.  Planes also always move while they’re mid-air, and they’ll appear larger or smaller eventually depending on which direction they are heading.  This object seemed to be a ball that was illuminated all over, it didn’t move, and it appeared the same size the whole time I looked at it.  Then as I looked further past it, eastward, I saw two other objects that were identical to the first one.  They all were in a perfectly straight line with one another, the line made a diagonal from where I was standing.  These objects didn't move either.  I know they had to be miles apart realistically, but from where I was standing they only seemed about 50 - 75 ft. apart from one another. Suddenly I saw the first object head westbound straight across the sky, it covered the distance pretty quickly, I’d say more quickly then the average plane would, but not astronomically so.  I didn’t hear any noise as this happened.  The other objects stayed in position and didn’t move.  About 30 seconds after seeing this, my train arrived at my platform; this was at 6:02 p.m.   I sat down and looked out of the window, and kept my eyes eastward on the sky for the length of my trip.  As soon as we’d covered about 4 or 5 blocks, I noticed that there hadn’t been two other objects behind the first one that had flown off.  There had actually been 3. I saw that even though this one was the furthest away from me, it was brightly lit and looked identical to those others, and it was next in the diagonal line, and it too just sat there in the sky as well. My train headed north to the downtown section of Chicago, and even as I covered at least 30 blocks worth of distance, from the original point at which I saw the objects, they were still very visible, and very bright, until some of the high rise buildings started to block my view. I know that they weren’t moving, because as I was riding on the train and looking out at the objects, they started to appear as if they were moving with me, in the same direction I was traveling, which is how the moon, or water towers of local suburbs, used to appear to me when I was younger riding in a car. Obviously a water tower is a fixed object, and it looked like it moved with me, so I know the same has to be true of these objects. My trip to downtown took about 15 minutes, because I arrived at work at 6:17 p.m. as I said, a few minutes before, my view of the objects had been blocked, but my eyes were still on the sky in case there was a clearing. I didn’t see the objects again, but I did see another aircraft flying a few miles higher than me, but parallel to the train I was on. I only glimpsed it for a few seconds because the buildings blocked my view. It could have been just a plane, but it was so low, and I think there’s some sort of a no fly zone, in downtown Chicago, so I don’t know why a plane would fly so close in that area. This is the only object whose shape I can’t really describe, it was possibly rectangular, but I didn’t get to really look at it. I just remember it flying in between one of the high rises, and it was brightly lit, but the craft itself was dark, probably brown. I felt that it looked odd because it didn’t look like a plane, yet it was flying. It was also bulky and heavy, looking, but quickly disappeared from my view. I definitely know that it didn’t resemble a plane at all.  I eventually went to work for four hours but I really hoped, that the objects I’d seen by my house would still be there when I got off, so that I could show someone in my family what I’d seen. I didn’t remember to look at the sky when I was on the platform because I was in a rush to get home, but when I was on the ground, about a block east of the train station, I walked southeast where there’s an open area of sky because of a parking lot. As I was crossing the street and heading south, I saw one of the objects or perhaps another one that was in the same vicinity of the ones I’d seen earlier. Only this time it was way closer to the ground than the ones I'd noticed earlier. I made my way onto the sidewalk and realized that the big concrete roof of the parking lot was blocking my view. So the object had to be very close to the ground because the roof of the parking lot is only about 15-20 ft high. I decided to back up a few feet and I walked in the street instead of the sidewalk in order to get a good look at the object.  I did, and basically I saw an object that resembled a saucer, but it wasn’t a flat thin disc, it had layers. The top layer was full of deep burgundy lights and so was the bottom one, I think they were on but they were very dull and nearly blended into the dark sky, that’s probably why I didn’t see them earlier. But the center layer was bright, bright white. The whole object was saucer shaped, and all of the lights looked like they were framed by rectangles. So they just looked like panels of lights. I do not know if I’d imagined it from the influence of TV and movies, but I do remember thinking that it hovered and rocked a little, instead of being completely still, but that could have been my mind adding that part in because I was so excited. As I kept walking south, my view was blocked again by the roof of the parking lot, so maybe the object had moved. About 20 seconds later, I’d moved past the parking lot’s roof, and parallel to the entrance of the parking lot.  This entrance isn’t enclosed by a roof, so there’s a very clear view of the sky but I still didn’t see the object. It was gone. I continued my way south and walked past the apartment building attached to the parking lot, which unfortunately blocked my view, because it too, is a high rise. About another 20-30 seconds later I continued my way south and crossed the street opposite this high rise, where there are just small houses and apt. buildings, which leave a better view of the sky and I still saw no objects, I headed east to get back to my building, and there still was no object in sight. But I kept my eyes on the sky for most of my walk and I did start to notice the stars, usually I don’t. They were visible, but since it’s Chicago and we have lots of lights and air pollution they aren’t blindingly white. So when I saw another object later on, I was totally sure it wasn’t a star.  I arrived inside my apt. at around 10:35 pm. About ten minutes later I turned off the light, in my bedroom and looked out of the window. I noticed a blinking object, west of my back window, which is further south in Chicago. It was much higher than the last one I’d just seen, and I would have taken it as a star if I hadn’t looked at the stars a few minutes ago when I was outside. This object was far away, but it wasn't as far as the stars were, and it was much brighter and bigger than the stars. It's light was white but it blinked on and off. I made out a reddish light that came from it as well. It too seemed to stand still and I think it was probably the same object that I’d seen 20 minutes before, when I was outside. But I’m not sure, I couldn’t tell its shape from so far away.  As I was gazing at the sky, I then saw a really large object traveling somewhat close to the ground, maybe 30 miles above that had a bright light attached underneath it. It was large and it was loud. I ran to the front of my apartment to get a better look, because it was fast and I believe this was a plane, but I do not believe it was a commercial plane, because it was so bulky, and because of the light coming from it, and because it was a dark color, I think it was a brown or bronze type of shade. It quickly covered the sky and was out of my sight within a minute or two, so I went back to the my other window to see the blinking object. It was still there, but it looked even further away, yet it was still very bright though. So I just decided to watch some TV because I couldn’t do anything about it and then I went to bed.",2007-03-08T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

The aircraft came in from the Northeast of town, circled around the north of town to the west of town and then went to the South-South West.  I followed the aircraft until it got approximately 5 miles to the South-West, when something caught my eye, above and to the south.  There was a dim flash of light, followed by what appeared to be a disk type of craft suddenly appearing.  All the edges of the craft appeared as though they were imbedded in clouds, although the night was cloudless.  I could briefly see lines and a circle around the center of the of the bottom of the craft.  It exhibted a color of burnt orange, which I later discovered was the reflection of the lights of the city.  It was about the size of a nickle held at arms length.  It suddenly started to move, and started to fade out of sight and moved toward and followed the aircraft to the South.  It is interesting to note that on the day before (Sunday) an AWACS E-3 airbourn radar aircraft orbited around this city for approx. 4 hours.  This is VERY unusual because Military aircraft don't fly around here on the weekends!  It was as if they were looking for something!!!

I was on the east side of the Sacramento river, facing west, having just come off Sutterville road and about turn on Riverside. It appeared to be just on the west side of the river, not quite straight ahead, and it was just a little to the right. My first guess was that it was a meteor, and I looked all over the local news next day for stories of a meteor hitting the ground somewhere in west Sacramento, but there was no story. According to a map of the area, the most probable area of impact was in a place with very few streets, which probably means very few houses. It may have struck and not been noticed, or it may not have hit the ground at all. That is what makes it interesting. It should have struck the ground after it went below the top of the trees. It wound seem unlikely for a meteor to evaporate just a couple of hundred feet before it reaches the ground. They usually do so while still high in the atmosphere. I have seen a few of them do just that. It crossed the entire arc of visibility (to me) in less than a second, and did not fade or slow down as it went, as it would have if it was going straight across the sky from behind me. If it was farther away than west Sac, or moving horizontally at high altitude, it had to be huge, and going at an unimaginable speed. It appeared round, and I estimate its size to be about half the diameter of a dime held at arms length. It appeared a little bit fuzzy, so I can't be more exact than that.

On February 18, 2007, 2015 AST, I observed from inside my cabin a pale green light that seemed to rise above Noyes Mountain 25 miles east of my location.  Initially I thought it was a bright star, but as it appeared to grow in size and move, I got a pair of 10x binoculars and went out on my porch to view the light. It appeared to descend down into the Suslota Creek drainage slightly below a 6400ft ridge that runs east to west on the north side of the drainage.  Several times the light was out of view because of the treeline.  The light then started to rise as if following the terrain and slope of Suslo Mountain 5 miles east north east of my cabin.  The altitude above ground level could not be determined, however, as it passed over the top of Suslo Mountain the light was close enough to the ground that the light green color reflected off the snow cover. The light then descended down toward the Tok Highway and seem to level off approximately 500-800 feet above the ground, traveling westward, then turned back to the northwest and began to ascend diagonally across the face of the mountains to the northwest of my cabin.  After reaching an altitude that was at least 1000 ft. above the mountains, the light moved off to the west north west.  Observation was lost at this time as the light was obscured by the mountains. The total time that the light was observed was 20 seconds. Weather at time of observation: wind 330 at 8kts, temperature -8F, baro 29.35, visibility cavu.  The straight line distance the light traveled while observed is approximately 35 miles.  There was no sound associated with the light, no satelite tv interference, nor did my housedogs or sleddogs react to the light. No distinct object shape or structure was seen, just a pastel pale green glowing light, similiar to a ball of St. Elmo's Fire or ball lightning. All turns and movements appeared to be deliberate, smooth and co-ordinated, and the speed at which it travelled appeared to be constant as best determined by this casual observer. No abrupt changes in speed or direction were noted. With nothing to compare size with in the darkness, I would estimate from the reflected light in the snow cover of Suslo Mountain and at the distance of closest observation of 3.5 miles that the light was 30 to 50 ft in diameter. From the east-west direction that the light was traveling to the point observation was lost,  it was obviously and deliberately terrain following along the southern slopes of the Alaska Range. It was by chance that I was sitting at my cabin window and glanced outside at the time of the initial sighting, had I been elsewhere in the cabin, it would not have been seen and there was no other unusual occurance or sound that would have brought it to my attention.  It would have passed totally unobserved.

While driving home on County Rd. 78 ( Luthman Rd.) in Shelby county, said person stopped along the road near a state park area to use Blue Out House to relieve himself. While using the facilities he had left his car door open with the radio playing loudly on a local fm station.  Upon exiting the Blue Out House he noticed his radio went to complete static. As he attempted to take the few large steps thru the knee high snow, he for whatever reason looked out the channel and upward to see a what appeared to be a high rise building like structure hovering above him the surrounding area.

The object seemed to be a kind of Black which seemed to mimic the stars around it in order to blend in. The surfaces where hard to distinguish enough to discern a exact shape, nevetheless best guesses lean towards upright rectangular shaped. The distance between observer, the object, and the lake below was extremely hard to Observe therefore the altitude of the UFO was not possible to calculate. Guesses lean towards the Huge object to be approx. 1000ft in the air while the top of the object must have been approx. 30 to 60 floors high as described by the observer while comparing it to a hovering apartment building from a large city.  While the observer was stunned and had been standing, staring in amazement for approx. 30 seconds the silence of the entire area including the object was noticed. There was no sounds except for the car and the staticy radio. The object ubruptly shot off towards space with no sound and at speeds uncomprehendable to the observer. The object traveled thru a cloud in the sky which left a hole that quickly refilled in the cloud. It would also be noticably important to mention that there were considerable windy conditions during this event.  The following night while typing this out the weather conditions where described as winds having calmed causing freezing fog to plague the dark area.",2007-02-24T00:00:00,,

I was planning on photographing the moon this evening.  The moon was spectacular Monday night. While waiting for the moon to rise I caught a glimpse of light out of my right eye.  Initially I thought another street light had come on and didn’t give it a second thought.  However, a few seconds later a second light appeared relatively close to the first light.  The first light disappeared.  A third light appeared close to the second light. When the third light appeared the second light went off.  After the  third light went off they all came on at the same time.  Then itstarted over again.  The lights were on about 15-30 seconds each time. By this time my adrenaline was at it’s all time high.  I became anxious and scared.  I left the parking lot to go get my husband,  by the time we got back, no more lights.  If there is ever a next time, I will stay. The lights came on and off very deliberately.  There was no movement that I could see.  I got outside my car to listen for noise.  There was none.  The lights were very low in the sky and seemed to be very close.  The lights appeared to be over the High School. The  lights  were on the same plane, close together,  but were  not the same distance apart.  The color of the first light is what initially caught my eye.  The lights were very bright, had a yellowish tint and were uniform in shape.  The lights came on quickly and they seemed slow to turn off.  The lights were not the same color as the stars. Fort Leonard Wood is very close to Salem.  There is fighter jet activity over Salem all the time.   I tried to rationalize the lights coming from some sort of aircraft  from Fort Leonard Wood.  This could be the case, but I don’t think so. Never, have I seen anything like this before.  I wish my husband had seen the lights too.  He thinks I am nuts, but I am not.

So my attention was drawn to see what was evidently on a path that would bring it very close to my house. As I looked to see what kind of helicopter it was, suddenly I noticed two bright lights traveling together in a straight path approximately a hundred feet apart. They were moving at least three hundred to four hundred miles an hour approximately a hundred and fifty feet in front of the helicopter. All three aircraft were traveling at only around three hundred feet in altitude. Directly in pursuit of the two lights was a very large, single rotor, obviously military helicopter with all of its flashing lights. The two lights made no noise, and had no other flashing or strobe lights- (proximity lights), just two ""star-like"" lights. I did not realize what I was watching until after the event. The two lights were traveling in a very straight path almost as if they were trying to elude the military helicopter, or possibly the helicopter was escorting them. The whole event only lasted for aproximately 30 seconds. It took three seconds for all aircraft to cross the night sky over my head.

Looking up and in front of me, I noticed a rapidly moving completely silent craft.  The craft was shaped roughly like a somewhat skinny axehead, with the ""axe blade"" in the front, two fluted sides forming the right and left flanks, and the smaller base of the axe in the back.  The front end, perhaps half the length as the sides, may have been somewhat rounded.  The back end was perhaps half the length of the front end.  Although the craft must have passed almost directly overhead just moments before, I couldn’t hear any sound from it.  It was perhaps nickel-sized at arm’s length.  It did not appear to be self-illuminated, but the moonshine from behind me must have been illuminating it enough for me to see it relatively clearly.  There was a bit of a shimmering appearance to it.  This was not an easy object to see, however.  If I hadn’t been looking at almost that exact spot in the sky, and if it hadn't been moving, I wouldn’t have noticed it.  It was moving across the sky fairly quickly, directly eastbound in a straight line towards Lake Michigan, and within fifteen seconds or so passed out of sight behind the trees in my yard.

These really weren't blinking...and the lights were too far apart to be from the same plane. it passed overhead slowly, couldn't have been extremely high in the sky, on account of the wingspan covering a wide field of the sky. There was a noise similar to the kind of noise you get as a large plane many thousands of feet in the sky passes overhead (you know, you see it and the sound is slower, so it appears that the sound of it is trailing behind)(it was very low in pitch, could be easily heard from indoors, and spooked a few of the local animals, including a cow...which I didn't know lived so close to us:). I could not make out a shape of the object, just its lights...three of them two on the outside being a very light orange with the third being grayish but not centered in between the two on the outside. They weren't crisply flickering, I'm not even sure you could say they flickered at all.  I wasn't sure who to contact, I looked in the phone book under Evansville Regional Airport, but the numbers were for parking employees, Security office...none of them seemed like the right contact for this type of question. Anyways, I just wondered if anyone else had seen it and reported of it, or if there was some kind of way you might forward this to anybody who would be interested or aware of what was flying overhead during that time. I am an amateur stargazer, have seen planes, planets, meteors all the like; but this was quite unusual and worth my trouble to email you, and hopefully I wasn't to much trouble for you to hear out.

At approximately 8:32 PM EST,  I Immediately noticed a top like or an upside down teardrop shaped fiery, orange light towards the North. I was standing in East Huntington area, Altizer to be exact.  I was leaving my work place for a 30 minute lunch break and I immediately noticed the glowing orange object and I said to myself, ""That's a weird and unusually bright star to be so low in the sky.""  I estimated it to be approximately 10 degrees above the horizon.   From  my vantage point in the parking lot it seemed to be across the Ohio river over southern Ohio and in The Procterville  or Scottown (if it was further North) area.  I walked to the furthest end of the parking lot (away from the bright street lights and light washout) to get a better look.  It seemed to be at least 3 miles away or maybe 5 miles away over Procterville.  I kept studying it, as it was an unusual orangey fire color and seem to undulate.   All the time I remained reserved in my opinion as it seemed to grow and shrink or maybe even pulsate. From the East, a small plane was coming in and going toward the West (possibly towards the Chesapeake airport [a very small landing strip] in southern Ohio).  I could easily see the red blinking FAA light on the left wing as it traveled from East to West or from my right to left, as I looked north.  As the airplane flew from East to West, from my right to left direction), it went directly underneath the orange, glowing object and the object shrank to a small point of light.   After the plane had passed under the object, it enlarged and brightened again and appeared as an undulating, flaming top.  This is when I began to lose my reservations that it was just a low or rising star.   I continued to watch it and noted that the sky was clear with visible stars and the crescent half moon but the exception of some moderately quick moving clouds coming from the West.  It was a very breezy also.   I watched until the Object dimmed down its intensity and blinked out in two or three seconds.  It seemed to collapse into itself as it disappeared.  I walked some more, scanning the sky to try to relocate it but I never saw it again.  In comparison, the red blinking FAA I searched for it again during my second break at 10:30PM, as I was leaving my job after midnight and again when I arrived at home a short distance away.  This is my fourth sighting and I have felt ""keyed up."" ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness via telephone, and he seemed to us to be quite sober-minded.

We stopped the car and viewed it.  No sound was heard. At 10:50PM it is still present in the same location.  This is the second time I have witnessed a triangular vehicle hovering over the Quad Cities region.  Two summers ago, at 3:00 AM I witnessed the same shape hovering north of my home over interstate 74 directly over Bettendorf.  This vehicle was much closer to the ground and easily defined as a black triangular object with multiple colored lights and much closer to the ground.  There was no sound. I would guess the size to be about that of a football field.  It is difficult for me to estimate the distance from the ground. I would not say it was fearfully close but close enough that one could distinguish the colors of its lights which were multi colored and discern the triangular shape of the object supporting the lights.  With regard to what we are witnessing this evening, given the distance of the sighting I have to state that this object has to be significantly larger than the one viewed two years ago. IF that is possible! It is presently far enough away and high enough in the sky that one cannot determine what supports the lights. The shape is defined by the pattern of the lights only and no difference in color of the lights is able to be distinguished. All lights appear white to my grandson and greenish white to my eyes.  At 11:30 PM the object is still in the sky but has changed location moving North West. I would estimate its distance is approximately seven to ten miles south of my home and the height in the sky has to be considerably higher than the sighting two years ago because it is easily seen above heavy timbered hills in front of my home.  I did take a video but the image recorded on tape does not represent what both of us view with our eyes which is a triangle.  On the video perhaps due to hand shake (VERY cold here) it appears as a bright white ball that moves and changes shape.  I shot it between the branches of trees in front of my home this is not the first location that we noticed it from however.  There will be two sections of video the first is 9:45 then a break in recording followed by the fatal attempt to zoom in on it with night shot. I was freezing cold and the hand shake makes it appear like a white ball bouncing around the screen. I did zoom back and shot through the same trees as the first video so you could see the movement relationship to its location between 9:45 and 11:30. Unfortunately the video does not reflect what we see viewing this object. It is definitely a clearly defined triangle when viewed by the human eye.  If you want to see the video I will be happy to mail it to you for what it is worth. Perhaps you may find some value in it. I am disappointed as it does not clearly reference the shape we both concede is a triangle.",2006-12-14T00:00:00,41.5738,-90.4582

When I reached our house, I got my step-dad's binaculars to get a closer look at it.  When I got it in focus, I could see blue lights on top, red on the bottom, and a white light in the middle that moved in alternating patterns. The object stayed stationary for half an hour after I noticed it. The lights shut off and I could no longer see it.  Not five minutes later, I saw another bright light to the right (south) of the first location. It was the exact same as the first object.   I put down the binaculars and called the sheriffs office.  When I looked at it again, it had changed into three red lights in a triangular shape. The bottom right light shut off, and the bottom left light moved in a horseshoe pattern to join with the top light.  This happened for a half an hour also.  After this one dissapeared, there was another farther off in the distance to the left (north) of the first location. I couldn't see this one as well. I checked to see if it was there every five minutes or so, and after another half an hour, it was gone.   On 12-7-06 I was driving home from work again at 22:30, when I saw a bright white light come from the south towards the road I was on.  It was the fastest thing I have ever seen.  It stopped right before the road for half a second, and flew off at a 90 degree angle from where it came.  It moved so fast that it just vanished over the horizon.   Two seconds later, it came back over the horizon towards our home. It slowed down and descended to the ground. When it was no more than fifty feet off the ground, the light shut off.

I was travelling south on Route 50 towards Bridgeville, heading home.   Just about a 1/8 to a quarter of a mile up from where I turned onto Route 50 from the road that goes to Walmart's parking lot, I saw bright lights coming at a high rate of speed directly towards the road I was on and in my direction... (ie- the lights were coming straight to me and the few other surrounding vehicles driving around me).  At first sighting, it was about a mile or two away in the sky.   I thought to myself that it was an awfully bright light for a plane, and I started looking for the FAA lights.  I didn't see any FAA lights on the plane.  I then thought to myself to grab my camera phone and try to snap a shot of what I was seeing.  I came up to the light on route 50 at Thoms Run Road.  It was a red light about to turn green.  This is not more than a 1/8 of a mile from when I made first sight of it.   At that point, the lighted craft was in plain sight, about hundred feet in front of me, and maybe and about three hundred feet to my right.  I'm not sure how high up in the sky it was, as it was moving very quickly, and I'm not very good at determining how high in the sky stuff is. At this point, the craft appeared to be somewhat circular in shape- the front of it facing me looked like a half circle or bananna kind of shape parallel to the horizon), and appeared to have lights surrounding the part of the craft facing me, but not on it's rear.  These lights, about 7 or 8 ( a guestimation), all seemed to blend into one horizontal light around the front of the craft...and much brighter than any aircraft I have seen before.   Traffic then started moving again, and cars were going very slow, curious about what the object was.  I snapped a picture of it at this point, and as it saved, the craft came very close to my car, directly above it.   At this point, the craft appeared to be triangular in shape, with a very bright light eminating from the center of it.  Then the craft moved in a circle from where it was, went behind my car, and came back around.  I snapped another picture of it when it came back around, moving in  what appeared to be a complete circle...and then it flew out of my sight in a north/north eastern direction- moving very quickly. I got two pictures on my camera cell phone, both show the date and time to be the same.  That should tell you how quickly this was moving. After seeing it, I did notice another airplane as I drove further down route 50, and it was much higher in the sky than the one I could not identify, and I could clearly make out the FAA lights.  It is typical to see low flying planes here in Bridgeville, as we are close to the Pittsburgh Airport (about ten to fifteen miles away).  The craft I could not identify was much lower than anything I have seen here before. When I got home, I decided to take a better look at the pictures with my roommate.  He is a paranormal investigator, and can, most often, disprove a lot of things that people can't indentify.  After zooming in on the images, neither of us could identify what this object was. My professional background is mostly in mental health, as a program director.  My personal background- I have an interest in the paranormal, and volunteer heavily for a paranormal research and investigation group.",2006-12-14T00:00:00,40.3456,-80.1342

This really freaked me out because of how fast it was gone. About 10sec later it appeared again a little ways to the right. Now it seemed brighter and it started to fade in and out of sight. My grandpa said that he thought it was a plane, I told him I didn’t think so because it was just sitting there. It then stopped flashing and just stayed there. All three of us were so drawn by the object that my grandpa almost hit an Elk that was standing on the road. After that the object just stayed there and as we got closer to the city the object was even brighter and we could definitely tell that it was over the city. That’s when we saw airplanes flying around the light. That’s when the light started flashing again and started moving off into the distance every time it did it. The airplanes seemed to go with it.

The green flash had a small green object falling from the sky with green rings trailing behind it. The sighting lasted from 1 to 2 seconds and it quickly disappeared with tiny white sparks shooting out just as it vanished. All of this took place without me hearing a sound, probably mostly because I had music on in my car and I didn’t have enough time to even think of turning it down to listen, if I could hear anything. I got into a panic as I screamed “Oh my God!” and I started hyperventilating until I started to calm myself down. I’ve never seen or heard of anything like this before.  It wasn’t so much of an Unidentified Flying Object as it was an Unidentified Falling Object.  I was not able to determine the distance or speed because it appeared almost as fast as it disappeared.  I was driving down the road in a northward direction when the object fell almost straight down. I expected the object to hit me any second which was part of the reason why I panicked, the other reason was that it happened so unexpectedly that I was startled by it and quite a bit frightened. I was thankfully not hit by the object which makes me wonder if it just disintegrated or hit somewhere else. Unfortunately I did not have my camcorder with me when this happened, which makes me so mad because I’ve been trying to be prepared for anything like this to happen.
