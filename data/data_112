It was a dark night with low cloud cover, and the soccer field was lit up on one side of the hill and the baseball diamond on Verona Road was lit up as well.  It was approximately 8:20-25pm or so.  The light from the baseball diamond lit up the hill behind us and cast our shadows on the hill. I suddenly noticed some dim movement up in the sky near the baseball diamond.  It looked like a triangular outline of squarish shapes that moved together in unison.  It was very difficult to make out and appeared translucent at times.  It moved across and over where we were standing and changed shape somewhat as it moved, almost appearing to be wavy like the surface of water with sunlight on it.  It looked like it was either reflecting or creating some sort of dim light, which we agreed was cream-colored. We considered what it could have been, ruled out migratory birds, but it possibly could have been a large bunch of balloons tied together in a line.  The wind was blowing fairly strongly and whatever it was was moving in the direction of the wind.  The shapes suddenly disappeared, but it could have vanished into clouds, it was very difficult to see. It is possible that what we saw could have been some reflection off the clouds by the bright lights that were shining on both fields.  But what made it even more strange, after seeing that and us wondering what it could be, was that maybe 45 seconds later an enormous explosion occurred on Verona Avenue, lighting up the entire sky.  It was obviously a transformer – sounded like one and lit up the sky like one, and I have seen two others – and it wiped the power out on both fields and much of the city (when we got back our power had been out as well).  Fire and rescue responded, which we got to see from the height of the hill. I just looked up the Fire Department site, and they reported two incidents 3 minutes apart that are documented in the links below in their online reports.  These would have been within the path of the flying thing, judging by the trajectory that it was going when we saw it.  We could also see the sirens that responded to the “alarms” from where we were standing. http://www.veronafire.com/incidents/detail/334598 http://www.veronafire.com/incidents/detail/334599  In general, the way this shape moved and looked in the light, which was very unnatural looking and not like anything we had seen before, as well as the timing of the exploding transformer, my gf and I both thought that this merited us reporting it.",2016-04-01T00:00:00,42.9925,-89.5679

The lights appeared to be seperated by 250' (76.2M) to 300' (91.4M).  The thing that brought it to my attention was the very low airspeed -- it appeared to fly at ~80mph (128.8kph) which is far below the speed of a passenger aircraft at similar altitude.

It was moving from the SW to the NE at a speed and altitude I normally associate with our usual air traffic.  Nevertheless, something seemed odd about it although I couldn’t pinpoint exactly what that was.  I let the dog in, grabbed binoculars, and crossed through the house to the backyard.  I easily picked up the object on the same trajectory, which made me think again that it was an airplane.  However, when I looked with binoculars I could not make out the body of an aircraft or any blinking lights.  I could only see a very bright, bluish-white light with a smaller, dimmer, reddish light on the upper right side/edge of the bright light.  The bluish-white light appeared circular, with the smaller red light located along the perimeter at a 1 o’clock position.  As I watched, waiting to glimpse a blinking navigation light, it seemed to me that the white light was too bright.  The intensity reminded me of the rocket that passed by here on November 7, 2015.  This light was not nearly that spectacular, but the quality of the light seemed similar (magnesium-like), if that makes any sense.  Then as I was tracking it eastward, the bluish-white light appeared to grow even brighter and more intense.  As I was puzzling about this, the bluish-white light began to rapidly dim until it extinguished, leaving only the barely visible reddish light which then also disappeared.  The entire time it had maintained a steady speed and it appeared to track at a consistent altitude and in the same (NE) direction.  The brightness followed by the rapid fading out reminded me of a flare, except that this object was traveling horizontally, was moving more slowly, and remained visible for a much longer amount of time than the maritime flares I have seen. For the same reasons, it also did not appear to be a meteor.  I scanned the skies for 10-! 15 minutes longer but never saw any additional sign of the obj! ect.  Several small aircraft did fly overhead during this time, following the more typical aircraft routes from S to N/ N to S.   Also, I did not hear any engine noise associated with the object, but did hear the noise of the planes that passed overhead minutes later.

At first I thought it was a star but it was low because I saw it through the trees.  A craft was flashing a very powerful light.  It moved very slowly. It was circular in shape and I thought I could see windows.  The lights from the windows were kind of yellowish like incandescent.   The flashing light was white like a slow strobe light.  It was followed by a second craft, perhaps 2 to 4 football fields behind it flying in perfect tandem.  They were about the same size but the craft following was in red light.   I would have thought it to be one huge craft but that is far bigger than anything man-made.  It seemed the front craft and the back craft seemed to be signalling with lights.  The one in front would flash and then the one behind in rhythm.  The front craft had white lights and the back was in red.  They were moving very slowly and crossed beside the cabin so I lost sight.  I looked around in the dark for my binoculars but I could not find them.   There was something creepy about it, and I was afraid to turn the lights on in the cabin to find the binoculars.  I did grab the camera however and went out to the front door which faces East South East.  The craft(s) continued at the same speed away from me and seemed to be climbing.  I got the impression it was mapping or searching for something like a Google Earth project.  It made me nervous.  There was absolutely no sound whatsoever.   I waited until it passed far into the distance in case it was very high and the sound might come later but there was absolutely no sound whatsoever.

My wife and I were driving northbound on I-25 from Colorado Springs to Denver.  The sighting happened somewhere between CO 470 and Yale Avenue.  We had seen several commercial aircraft flying at low altitudes over the interstate coming from DIA before the sighting.  We then saw two flat, white discs or cigar shaped objects.  We were looking at them edge on, they were definitely not saucer or dome shaped.  The objects were moving at approximately the same altitude and speed relative to the other commercial airliners. The two objects caught our attention because they seemed to move similar to the aircraft previously seen, but didn't have wings and appeared at least twice the size of the commercial airliners.  In comparison with the Sun, they would have fit almost perfectly into the radius of the Sun's circle, with perhaps some overlap for the object closest to us (further south).  They looked like thin, bring white lines across the deep blue sky.  Today was a beautiful sunny day, so their bright white color against the deep blue back drop was very easily seen. I estimated they were a good 5 to 10 miles ahead of us, looking due North.  Of course, I'm not a good judge of aerial distances, but I use the other commercial aircraft in the area as my point of reference for this estimation.  One of the objects was obviously closer to us (further south) while the second appeared smaller and seemed to be few miles further North than the first object closest to us.   They appeared to move from an E to a NW direction, similar to the commercial aircraft coming out of DIA over downtown Denver headed west over the mountains.  Then, they suddenly stopped over I-25 or perhaps just west of I-25.   At this point we were looking at them NNW of our viewpoint on I-25N.  The two objects then hovered for about 30 seconds max (possibly less) and then began to turn a reddish orange color, slowly becoming more and more transparent with the blue sky - and then poof!  They disappeared!   This all happened in less than a minute and we were traveling at 80 mph.  So unfortunately, we didn't get a photo or video of the event.  However, it did shake up my wife and was very unsettling to her.  She has not been one to believe in UFO's and when I tried to talk to her about it afterward, she was very uncomfortable and didn't want to discuss it.  I know what I saw and this was something very ""unidentifiable.""   If anyone else on I-25 at this same time headed northbound along side us looked up in the sky to the North-Northwest, they would have seen the same thing.

I was outside in my back yard at 10:15 pm CST, on Saturday March 5, 2016.  To my southeast I saw a moving bright red light that was flying level at about 3,000-ft altitude and at about 1-mile horizontal distance from me.  It was flying northeast, from my right to my left, along a path roughly estimated to follow Garland Road from Casa Linda Plaza to Whiterock Marketplace Shopping Center, where it then turned northward toward Lochwood Park (Google Map). At first, I thought it was a small airplane in straight level flight without much variation. Its speed was about 200-mph, too fast to be a helicopter.  I looked for any other lights, specifically white strobes and green navigation lights, but it only had a steady intense red.  Since it is illegal to fly below 10,000-feet without white lights, I quickly inferred that it was not an airplane or other human construct.  No craft silhouette was visible because of the steady bright red light.  Then, I purposely listened intently for an airplane sound, but there was only dead silence.  The craft then swung around from my southeast to my northeast, apparently making a 45-degree left turn, and headed northwest, keeping 1-mile distance from me.  When it was to my northeast, I lost sight of it because of trees.  I watched it travel about 1.6-miles total distance and my sighting lasted about 30-seconds. I am 76-years of age, take walks every night, and have vast experience viewing aircraft in the night sky.  I have witnessed several other anomalous objects over Dallas within the past three years, but none before 2013.  My conclusion is that this particular craft was a machine that is NOT man-made, because – 1.  The lighting was illegal, 2.  There was no sound at all, 3.  The large scale ruled out an RC drone, 4.  The speed indicated a powerful craft, 5.  The time was late for small airplane operations, 6.  The flight path was illogical.",2016-03-11T00:00:00,32.83516807743405,-96.80811785917632

I went outside and actually was looking for anything moving in the sky. (Because I actively now seek this stuff out) I spent 20mins looking at all the stars and trying to find an odd one. In the south western sky high over the tree line I noticed there was 3 star looking objects in formation of a perfect triangle, and a very bright looking star next to the formation (so 4 all together)  At first, I kept staring at this formation as I found it odd all the objects were stationary  and I have never noticed this constellation of stars. I kept searching but could not find anything I thought. I went back inside then went back out to smoke again 20 mins later. I could not find the triangle formation that was previously there but did still see the big bright star. I stared at it and saw bright lights coming from it.  Greens, bright blues, red, orange all the colors of the rainbow.  It was moving very slowly but fast enough (in all directions up, down, and horizontally) and now I could see it was changing it kept making a red triangle and I'm not sure if it was just flashing this or if that was the shape.  It also flashed a few other pictures/shapes one looked like a pine or Xmas tree)   At some points I could see it looked like a classic ufo...round, seamless, and rotating horizontal lights, but as I stared harder at it, it was changing to a triangle then to a round object. At a few points it looked diamond shaped then maybe it could have been multiple ufos in formation it changed so often I could not tell. Sometimes the entire thing got very bright then it had and aura around it. The flashing different bright lights never fades though only when a regular plane flew by did it stay stationary and white. It had to be very far away because I had no readings on my magnetometer. And I know how crazy this might sound but I want to be honest I felt waves coming from this, only when it was in view and I was staring at it.  It felt like my vision was like twilight zone everything went black and then bright in and out.  At one point there was stripped lights down trees in my vision as my vision blacked in and out.  There was no fear or pain or negativeness I really didn't feel much while in this trance state (it also felt voluntary but hypnotized)other than pure interest/curiousity and I tried to allow the waves to take over as far as they would go but once I blinked the waves stopped and started over again until I blinked or the object went out of veiw. The object eventually slowly fell out of veiw within a little over an hour (it fell behind the trees) & my boyfriend who thinks aliens are absurd started yelling at me, but I wanted to get in my car and follow it.  Too bad I was unable to. Please note I did try to video tape this effect but I could not hold my phone long enough to get anything also every time I tried the object did not look the same as it did in person I believe this is due to my phone not having a good camera and I was shaking and could not hold it still.",2016-03-11T00:00:00,42.6038,-72.2948

At about 20:15 I left Hurdle Mills, NC, and headed south down Guess Road.  Every time the tree cover broke to the west, I saw several extremely bright lights hovering in the distance to the southwest.   I kept looking at them as I was driving and at some point I realized they were much brighter than anything I have ever seen before.  All of a sudden, the lights quickly moved toward me going northeast.   As the lights got closer, I thought they were on a triangular object with a light on each corner.  I thought the object was a stealth bomber.   I pulled over to the side of the road, took a picture of it with my cell phone, and called my mother.  As it got closer to me, I realized that the triangular shape was only the front half of the vehicle and it was actually diamond shaped.   As it flew faster toward me, I rolled down my car window, stuck my head out the window, and looked at it as it passed over me.  It was huge and flying at a very low height – around the ! height a crop-duster might fly.  Each side seemed to be 75’ – 100’.  I was awestruck at how something that big could stay in the air and then I realized it was silent and I freaked out a bit. I remember thinking that I needed to note the location and I remember passing by Holeman-Ashley Road, but I don’t remember if that was right before or after I saw the object. After the object passed over me it quickly was out-of-sight. I drove to the first safe place to pull over, a gas station at the intersection of Routes 157 and 57, and looked for a pen or pencil to use to record everything I witnessed.  I didn’t gave a pen in my glove box or front seat, so I got out of my car to see if I had one in my purse on the back seat.  As soon as I exited the car, I noticed that many dogs were barking hard.  It was eerie. After recording everything, I got back into my car and started driving to my original destination.  Someone drove up behind me, started tailgating me, and followed me to my destination about 25 miles away.  I was upset about it but then I remembered looking in my rear view mirror when I had pulled over to watch the object, and I had seen a blue car pull over about 200 feet behind me.  The car that was following me was also blue and I think that person might be a witness, too.  In retrospect, I think that person might have been following me to see if I saw what he or she saw.  If someone contacts me about this incident, I have the make, model and license plate number of the blue car, but I never spoke to the person, in case the person was a nut. One other thing to note…before I left my house and saw the object, I let my dogs outside in my yard for about 15 minutes.  When I went outside to get them and bring them inside, all three were hiding under my porch.  One of my dogs frequently does this, but not all three dogs.  Again, in retrospect, I wonder if they sensed something was different.",2016-03-11T00:00:00,36.2599,-79.068

While picking up tools facing my shed I heard a muffled bang...but a strong. It was like the noise took a breath.  I could feel the energy suck in and push outward like a volatile explosive as it is triggered by a blasting cap.  The noise also had a kind of twangy echo like a indoor shooting range.   Within 15sec the sound of a jet engine emanated from the same place as the bang.  Putting the pieces together as they came into light led me to the belief that a jet plane was flying at a high altitude due to the cloud ceiling which would give way too much turbulence to achieve super sonic speeds.  And the cloud ceiling also muffled the bang by being denser than air so a portion of the noise would slow, bounce off, and travel along the ceiling instead of being free to instantly pass through air and travel to the ground.  The jet was so high that it was impossible to spot.  It was traveling due south to wards New Orleans, the Gulf of Mexico, and the mouth of the Mississippi River.   I then heard it travel in a North or North West direction, maybe passing as far over as Gulfport, Ms, then coming back up seemingly to the point origin to head south again...possibly near Hammond, La.  These distances are only guesses from the rough speed it had to be traveling, length of time a jet exhaust was heard on a particular trajectory.  It must have circled at least five times, once heading south there was a second exhaust that went its own way once they reached the southern destination.  These intense activities slowed or stopped at 19:55.  Through the night I have heard the jet every couple of hours but just passing by once or twice but nothing kike the roughly half hour of consistent circling.

As I was approaching the county line about to cross into Henry County, I noticed a light off to the northeast, roughly over Frog Road and the community of Luella.  I was travelling at approximately 55-60 MPH, the sky was overcast, with prevailing winds coming out of the northeast, air temperature 57o.  A slight and intermittent rain was present in patchy areas, but barely detectable.  The cloud deck was high, but solid.   At first glance, I presumed the object was a helicopter, perhaps a med-flight bound for Spalding Regional Hospital in Griffin, Georgia.  As I watched it however, it became apparent that it was not a helicopter.  My first instinct as a retired emergency communications officer (911/police/fire radio operator and supervisor, critical incident response commander) was that since the object was relative to the high-tension power! lines that cross the highway,  I was seeing a power line on fire.  I passed under the power lines and made a u-turn to double check.  As I approached the power lines (heading south), I looked for signs for signs of fire, but the lines were clear. As I passed the power lines and crossed back into Spalding County, the object crossed the highway from left to right and was then concealed by a tree line to my right approximately 600 yards from my position.  I cleared the tree line, and the object was no longer visible.  I decided to pull into a dirt road (Johnson Road Extension) to turn around and abandon any further attempt to view the object.   As I pulled onto 155 and headed north, I spotted the object again almost in the exact same position I was in when I first sighted it, except it was then off to the northwest (left), and relatively stationary.  I stopped the truck and watched it as it appeared to descend roughly over the Cole Reservoir.  There is a large golf community (Heron Bay) located where the object appeared to descend.  I had no other witnesses, and, unusually, there were no other vehicles travelling on 155 in either direction when this occurred. I cannot quite find a technical description to articulate the object I saw.  I was unable to determine a shape at all.  The light was variable in magnitude; at its brightest, it was about as intense as a street light and amber/orange in color (when the illumination intensified, the spectral range was nearly in the white, but generally dark to amber/orange).  Its movement was generally horizontal, with some vertical movement; much like a plastic bag that has been caught by the wind.  The consistency of the color and magnitude of its luminescence was similar to the manner in which an ember emanates light as it rises from a fire.  Its speed was also variable, and I would estimate it moving at its fastest during the sighting as no more than 100 MPH, and as slow as stationary. I have never seen anything like this.  We live in an area that has historically been free from light pollution, use a telescope for stargazing regularly, and see satellites and high altitude aircraft regularly.  I took one or two flight lessons while in high school, and grew up near Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, so I am no stranger to aircraft and flight patterns (at the time of the sighting, Hartsfield had outbound traffic at approximately 10,000 feet, northeast to southwest, roughly 2 minutes between aircraft).  This object gave the impression that it was closer than it appeared.  The illumination was not configured; it was apparently “random” lighting, as though it moved all about the surface of the object, but concentrated primarily at a ventral, abaxial angle from my point of view. The best rough coordinates I can provide are as follows: First sighting:  33o 20’01.81” N x 84o09’58.2” W (moving) Second sighting: 33o 19’14.65” N x 84o 10’56.66” W (moving) Third Sighting:  33o 19’59.51” N x 84o 11’52.30” W (stationary/descending)  (Note: the first and third coordinate readings are roughly parallel, minus about a thousand horizontal compass feet, I think.)   As a retired emergency communications officer, my professional reputation does not compel me to report such things, but my instincts tell me I saw something odd.  I am not familiar with drones, but would not rule out the possibility of someone with an illuminated drone playing around.  I researched footage for any relevant similarities and they were somewhat, but not entirely consistent with what I saw.   I was unable to take a picture as my cellphone will not zoom and the picture would therefore not have been of any use.  I just thought that since this was the first time I’d ever seen any such thing I might report it to somebody on the outside chance any similar sightings in the area or time frame were reported, or may be reported. I left a message with my name and number on your voice mail should you have or need any further information. Many Thanks for Your Time and Attention….",2016-04-15T00:00:00,,

Well the whole time we were in Millwood the orange orbs continuously kept popping up so we pulled over and looked up in the the sky and seen and heard jets.   At first when we seen the first white orb there was no jets in the sky thats what really freaked me out.  The orange orbs kept popping up all the way until we got into Andrews. We stopped at a church in an area some locals call spring gully, and seen another white orb really far away in the sky cut a loop in the sky then it turnt orange and the whole time jets were always near the orbs.  I don't know what it was but it was freaky.",2016-04-15T00:00:00,,

We both said, “What is that!” I took off to get my phone 15 ft. away and I heard my husband say, “It disappeared.”  I said, “It figures when I want to take a picture.”  Then, all of a sudden, it reappeared but it had changed its shape and color.  Now it looked like a giant star that I see in the sky every night but it was moving slowly.  It was now white and appeared to have 5 bright white dots connected with lighter white lines.  I followed it for about 30 seconds as it moved slowly across the sky.  Then it hovered in the distance for another 30 seconds as I shined my phone light towards it and then it disappeared.

It's a perfectly clear day, my father and I were ending our sailing trip and as I look into the sky and I see this image of an airplane and I said to my dad, ""Look, theres a plane"" and he acknowledged seeing the image too. This plane however seemed like a transparent image of a plane.  I could clearly see the outline of the wing span and the cabin.  There seemed to be a bright light in the middle as if the sun was reflecting off of it.  Then from the outward of the image to the middle it started disappearing until the white light was the only thing left then vanished. Fairfield, Ca, has Travis Airforce Base and this would probably be a good flight plan for it.  I immediately thought I saw a military UFO/Optical allusion/ Cloud... about an hour later around the same spot I saw the same thing.  It seemed as if a plane was calibrating/testing a cloaking tech, or seeing how well they could scale up the tech as this unexplainded image of a transparent plane was kind of big.  Not like a fighter jet but more like a 747 or a supply plane of sort. After I saw the image for the second time I saw other planes in the sky without the same effect.

As normal we got up to check on him, me to grab him and console him, my future wife to prep a bottle for him.  I picked him up and as leaving the nursery, I looked down the stairs to my right, through the garage window, and saw a tall slender thin black entity, I know I saw it and as I looked at it it darted inhumanly quick, out of sight. I went to the room with our son, my common-law partner had the bottle ready, i tried to get one of the 5 dogs to leave the room with me.  3 are ours 2 german shepherds, one chocolate lab, plus the two that we are watching of my mother's.  the dogs were to scared to leave the room which is unheard of.  One of my mother's dogs also a german shepherd left the room with me the others with any amount of coaxing would not move, as soon as we left the room, the shepherd tucked its tail between its legs, and booked to the piano in the living room which it stayed under and trembled. I would dismiss this as my mind playing tricks on me, however when I was 19 years of age, and I am 36 now I had an experience with a tall slender black, that has haunted me ever since.  I dont talk about it as people are quick to judge and wont believe.  I used to work then in Saskatoon, Canada,  I worked at Wal-Mart of all places, and i worked in receiving, i also worked at a popular bar/restaurant. Needless to say, I worked a shift in the city untill midnight at Wal-Mart.  The store was 4 city blocks from the residence at which i was staying.  If you have ever worked there you punch your social security number into a computer at the back of the store, this starts your shift.  I punched out after shift and was walking home, it was dark in the city but with the lights u could see very well.   I walked south 2 blocks down to Mckercher and 8th street, where there was a macs store, and rogers video rental store at the time.  I took a shortcut through the parking lot, directly in front of the macs store, as i reached the sidewalk again by the Macs store, strangely i noticed an eery abscence of light, took two steps and heard a metallic sound as i walked, i looked around feeling stranger and noticed the city lights were gone, i could not see the store there was only blackness.   I then heard a metallic cling twice from behind me coneing from the ground, i spun around wuickly to see an alien grey in colour with a triangular face, and black eyes.  I was not panicked for some reason and said hi.  The alien quickly shot out its arm and touched me with a finger on my chest, I was not scared untill this point, as the finger touched me there was an electric like charge i could feel.  This charge paralyzed me and i felt forced fear.  Every nerve ending in my body reverberated with this schock, and the fear I felt did not come from me but felt forced, and it was 1000 times worse than any i had ever felt.  The fear was at such a level that my heart pained instantly, and i had to focus quickly and steadily at slowing my pulse as i didn't think my heart would be capable of sustaining my life otherwise.   The next thing i knew i woke up on a metalic rectangular table, with 6 seven to eight foot tall thin tall black beings standing around me, Dear god one had its hand inside of me, it felt like it was tearing me apart, the pain i remember, and the forced fear still ther! e, still paralyzed, trying desperatlely to move. The entity to! wering a bove me went through my entire body it felt tearing me apart and putting me back together again, unimagineable pain. I blacked out.  The next thing i knew, i wake up its all black and im on a metallic floor, i hear clinging on the floor. i see 4 of these tall black entitys they begin kicking me, hurting me more. I try to move im still paralyzed, the fear so severe it runs through every nerve ending in my body, its forced i can't fight it, almost electrical.  I feel im going to die here, I dont want to die here no dear god no. I begin to grow angry as i get beat, i look in my mind and struggle with all I have trying to move to be able to do anything, I force a little bit of movement, i move an arm, my body still not cooperateing it takes everything i have but damn it im dying here fighting, i swing the rest of me unable to move and i hit one of the entitys, then the fear even stronger the paralysis even strobger my body goes limp, trapped in my body scared and unable to move i b! lack out. The only thing i remember next is wakeing up in bed at home, trembling and convulseing uncintrollaby, still paralyzed still the forced fear. I try to move I cant. My heart the pain its unbearable, my heart feels its about to explode, my body feels like its viberateing from my heart beating so fast. I focus with all I have I dont want to die, I try to calm my heart slow it down, it works, I try to move it feels like for 4 hours maybie only feel god only knows im still paralyzed, still that damned fear. finally i break free. I go upstairs my mom looks shocked to see me, tells me I was missing for 3 days, thought I was a t a friends. In my mind I was missing no time at all. I thought I had a nightmare, I tell myself a dream. Not so lucky I check the comp at work it shows i was there. No one at work remebers me being there, they tell me i missed my shifts. What has the power to do this, no one remembered me for 3 days. the only thing that tells me i wasnt. insane was the compute! r. My memory has me missing for a day.  I saw that damnable thing again tonight. i loaded the guns and i sit and wait for daylight.  I last saw it when 19 am 36 now, my memories of it used to be so bad id remember pieces over the years would wake up paralyzed in a sweat, and terified, i fought the fear in my mind until i could remember and not go into convulsions, still function still move. I would have dismissed what i saw tonight but ive seen it before. no one believes, no one cares.  there is no help for me to be had just felt i needed to write this, not sure why they came back.",2016-03-24T00:00:00,,

I estimate its elevation at approx 1000 feet.  It was just below the cloud cover.  The craft appeared to light up via a blinking light which immersed most of the craft.  It was like nothing I have ever seen on an airplane.  It was as though it completely enveloped the craft in a strange sort of grey light, at intervals, or perhaps a running light lit the sides of the craft, the sides perhaps being grey in color, I am not sure.  I am former Air Force and a retired Police Officer.  I do watch the skies.   The object was moving very quickly and was lost to sight as it proceeded North.  There was no noise associated with the object.  Had this been a fighter Jet, for instance an F-18 out of Beale, I would have certainly heard the jet engines.  I redirected my attention to the Phantom, and then quickly noticed that there was a large multi-prop airplane coming directly at (so it appeared) my Phantom.  This aircraft appeared to be VERY LOW.  It flew in from the West and proceeded East until lost to sight.  It was running a number of lights that were turned on, I am not sure if these were landing lights, but I dont think so.  It actually intersected the course of the unknown craft only be about 20 seconds, and this airplane really startled me.  I am still a little shaken by the whole thing.  We do have P-3's flying out of Beale I believe and you see them in this area quite often, BUT this P-3 (I'm assuming it was P-3) was EXTREMELY LOW.

At 2145 I was sitting in my backyard outdoor spa looking at the stars, when I observed what initially looked like a formation of three triangular aircraft in a pyramid shape fly directly overhead.  I had a limited field of view due to the design of my house but the aircraft took five to eight seconds to transit across it and out of sight. My initial impression of the formation was that it was three Super Hornets travelling to local Airforce Base, but it was immediately apparent that they were the wrong shape and were travelling way too fast for aircraft at altitude. I then presumed that they were three large birds flying in a chevron formation, but the leading and trailing edges of the triangles were straight lines with smooth edges. No flapping or noise was observed. My final impression was that I was looking at three equally sized equilateral dark coloured (or black) triangles flying in a pyramid formation with their tips almost touching, or that it was one larger dark coloured triangle with a triangular center section cut from it.  I could clearly see the night sky through the triangular hole in the middle of the aircraft/formation.  No lights were visible on the aircraft and there was no reflections or glare from any of the surfaces. The aircraft travelled directly over me so I only saw it from underneath and I could not tell if it was medium sized and low to the ground, or very large and high.  My gut feeling was that it was 150 –300ft from the ground but I can’t really base that on anything more than how it appeared to me.  The craft/formation was probably twice the size of a full moon. The aircraft tracked from South to North. I tried to get out of the spa and continue to observe it but I broke contact and failed to regain it.  I suggest it may have been blocked from view by my neighbour’s house which is why I presume it was flying lower to the ground rather than at altitude. There was absolutely no noise associated with the aircraft which was probably the thing that most struck me as strange.  It literally glided past in silence in a dead straight line, directly above me. I called the Port Adelaide Police Station approximately 1 hour after the event and asked if any strange aircraft or flying triangles had been seen or reported during the evening. Nothing had been reported. Ambient Conditions:  Wind: 0-3kts  Temperature:  21c  Cloud:  0/8 (clear sky to the horizon)  Moon:  Waning Crescent (half-moon)  Ambient Noise:  Low.

As I took the dogs out for their last break of the evening before bed (11:00pm), I was on the front porch admiring the full moon and noticed a red-orange sphere coming over the ridge from the southwest.  The dogs were scared and wanted back in the house quickly.   I thought at first it was a helicopter but then realized that there were no running lights and absolutely no noise.  I called for my husband to come see it.  As it passed overhead to the northeast, it eventually got smaller until it was gone.  It wasn’t but a few moments before two more started over the ridge one by one.   Hubby got his camera and took photos of the spheres.  As they disappeared into the northwest night sky, another would appear over the ridge.  We witnessed 9 of these red-orange spheres in total within 15-20 minutes; each one of them moving at different speeds, in slightly different trajectories, and their red-orange color would change as they flew overhead.   We tried to come up with logical sources, like Chinese lanterns or emergency flares, but upon closer inspection of the photos it was clear that they couldn’t have been either of those things.   Hubby also took photos of the aircraft in the night sky and the spheres looked very different. The camera batteries were drained but the camera continued working. *We will email photos.

I was standing in the kitchen with my wife, looking out the window, as I often do, when I noticed a strange object in the sky.   I immediately knew I was seeing something that I do not see regularly, but as I watched it, I became fascinated.   I quickly went outside and watched what appeared to be a pyramid like shape, very dark, possibly metallic black in color slowly hovering towards us.   I was thinking drone at first but it seemed too high up in the sky to be anything controlled from the ground.   It continued to move toward us slowly, and I couldn't take my eyes off it for a second.  I thought maybe it was some kind of strange helicopter (it seemed to be about that size) and I thought I could see some kind of swirling above it, but I could not focus on anything for sure.  I then noticed two very small objects hovering around it.  One stayed kind of below it and the other to the right of it.  They would seem to change distances from the object, but never move to far towards it or away.   These objects were coming out of the east and then turned and started moving higher into the sky and north.  I thought I saw it wobble a bit before it headed north.  The smaller objects also looked very dark, black and would occasionally glint like metal from the sun for a second, just as the larger pyramid like structure did.   As it began to climb and head north, it appeared to have an energy bubble around it for a few seconds.  It was light blue (cyan) circle of energy around it and my heart started racing when I saw this.  It was quite visible first and maybe a minute later I saw it again but very faint.   As it continued North, I began to start thinking about it and if it was some kind of strange balloon?  It made no noise at all.  It continued North until it faded from my vision.   My wife ran to get my binoculars but by that time it was very distant.  She wears glasses and did not have them with her, so was unable to see any details. I don't know what I saw, but it was very strange.  I keep thinking it could have been some kind of very elaborate balloon, but it feels like my rational mind is just trying to make sense of it.  I've never seen anything in the sky even remotely like this and I hope that some of the other millions of Long Islanders have seen this and can give more information.

Possibly a single object. This event was also reported to MUFON, reference case report 74899. The event details are as follows:  On 29 FEB, 2016, at approximately 18:20, a co-worker and myself saw something we cannot explain while returning to our work center from lunch. Driving north from a restaurant about a mile from our work center, we first noticed the object about halfway through the drive back.  It was dusk and the sky was darkening, with thin clouds to the north and east. The object was a bright string of lights located to the north, approximately 25-30 degrees above the horizon, moving slowly in a westerly direction.  The light nearest the ""front"" of the object was of a reddish orange color, and a bit brighter than the rest.  Trailing behind this red light was a line of numerous yellow, somewhat dimmer lights that were spaced very closely together. For the first 10-15 seconds after spotting the object, it continued to move slowly towards the west and the lights appeared to pulse or waver slightly, possibly due to atmospheric turbulence.  After this 10-15 second period, all of the lights started to dim and then disappear from sight.  This object remained invisible for approximately 5 seconds, when suddenly it began to re-appear. Once it reached full brightness and size, I could discern that the lights were not an exact straight line, but seemed to curve under and out at the front of the object.  I infer from this effect that the lights were possibly arranged in a V or chevron pattern, and that I was observing the object nearly edge on.  The details of the shape can be viewed in the included rough sketch.  The object continued moving west for approximately 10 more seconds before fading from view again, disappearing permanently this time. At no time was I able to see a solid object.  There were two other witness that I know of at my work center that saw the object as well. My coworker and I have years of military experience between us in the USAF. Neither one of us had ever seen an object quite like this.  There are many types of aircraft that operate at Edwards AFB, nothing we know of matches the behavior of these lights.  It is our opinion that these lights were not aerial flares.  They moved in unison and did not vary in altitude.  What we saw was either a large group of objects flying in a extremely tight formation, or that these lights were part of a single, large object.  The behavior and consistent altitude of the lights, the distance between them and the lateral motion leads me to believe they were part of the same object. Also, I believe there are witness to the same event outside my exact location. Reference MUFON case number 74891, a report made on the same day in California City of a very similar object.  California City is located 15 miles north east of Edwards AFB.",2016-03-04T00:00:00,,

I observed two bright flashing lights approximately south/southwest at about 30-degrees about horizon.  At first I assumed they were helicopters moving easterly.  They gave the ""impression"" that they were quite distant, which would place them well into Mexico, south of Tijuana, at 15-20 thousand feet altitude (wild guess).   The two lights were bright, orange/reddish with a flickering point source in the direction of travel.  The lights were not a ""point source,"" but appeared to have an approximately oval and flickering shape.   The two lights moved in unison at perhaps 10-degrees separation.  The ""higher"" one then moved in an apparent downward direction directly toward the lower one.  In a span of about 10-seconds they appeared to merge and then separate, with the one moving down continuing the same trajectory.  It continued to move down, but started flickering in intensity over a span of about 15 seconds, after which it completely faded from sight. A third light then appeared further to the west, also moving in an easterly direction.  This would have placed it apparently well out to sea and south of the international border line.  It appeared to be about 20-degrees above the horizon.  After a minute or so it appeared to stop (hover?) and then moved south (down from my perspective) at what must have been great speed for its apparent distance, and then faded in intensity until lost from sight. The weather was clear, stars were visible, the moon was at its zenith overhead.  There might have been some haze toward the west over the ocean, at less then 5-degrees about the horizon.  Temperature was 60-degrees F, humidity 83%. Obtained a crude video using a cell phone camera. Observed during evening walk. My wife also observed the lights from home.  She didn't think anything of them, assuming they were aircraft.  She observed the apparent merging too, but assumed they were at different distances.  Her viewing location was approximately 800-feet west of my location.  The lights appeared in the same direction to her as they did to me.

I decided to stop outside my front door to take a look at the sky, and listen to the wind blowing through the trees.

I can only describe it as appearing like the flash of a camera except much slower and estimated to last approximately one to one and one half seconds.  I was amazed at how bright this light was when it flashed. It appeared to be extremely high in the sky and there were no other lights to accompany it.  There was no aircraft engine sound that I could hear.  It would flash approximately every ten to fifteen seconds and it was moving from north to south.  It was above cloud level, as I tracked it by its flash, I could no longer see it as it passed above the approaching clouds.  I could not see any type or shape of a structure around the light.

Once it was at cruising altitude, it stayed parallel with ground and increased speed gradually till it was finally so far away the light became to dim to make out.  Was not a plane or helicopter, and too close to earth and straight/steady to be some sort of falling debris. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) It's 100% true.  I was playing with my son in the front yard and we were pointing up to the stars when we saw it.  I always scoffed at reports like this and said, ""Why wouldn't they have a picture"" if it was real.  Then of course, it happens to me, and not only did I not have my phone to take a picture...honestly I didn't even think about it.  I was too busy staring at it, following it down the road, and if anything...looking around to see if my neighbors were out....but to no avail.

I saw something identical to the quoted dressier ion from Lebanon, Missouri, approximately 15 miles north of Clinton on Highway 7 South. Inititially, I thought it was a meteorite that broke up, or a small firework.  It appeared to be 100 - 200 feet in altitude.  I then saw something identical several times as I drove.  It appeared to be in a similar location each time, but I was driving on a highway with curves, so I could not be certain.  Each time the lights seemed to appear at the same time, but they disappeared intermittently over a 1 second span, as if they were separate burning out objects.  As I approached the spot of the objects, which was at least several hundred yards west of the highway in an apparently wooded area, the shaped changed from an irregular cluster to a triangular shape.  I did not attribute the apparent change in shape to movement of the objects.  The apparent change in shape seemed to me to be due to my change in position relative to the event.  Although, from the change in the apparent shape, at first the lights seemed to be arranged in an irregular 3 dimensional pattern, and later the objects seemed to be in the same 2 dimensional plane. Note, I am a skeptic.  ""Several Orange Globe Fireball Lights Low in the Sky, Winking Out and Coming Back In Other Locations  My teenage son roams our 2 acre property every evening looking at stars and playing with our cats. He came in to get me a few minutes before 7 and told me he saw some strange orange globe lights in the sky and that he didn't know what they were. I immediately went out, looked in the northwest sky, just over the horizon and I saw an orange globe fireball light that suddenly split apart and was 3 globes, but they were very very close together and I couldn't tell f it was one or three. My son said the same. he couldn't tell if it was four or one. They stayed in the sky for 15 seconds or so, and then just went out.  Over the next hour and a half the lights came back, all in similar areas, but not exactly the same place.  Sometimes the globes were further apart, other times, closer.

My entire house was getting ready for bed, when my Mom called my Brother and me into her bedroom.  She claimed she saw an incredibly blinding bright light, followed by these insane loud noises--that I also heard as I entered her bedroom.  The sounds were loud enough to fill my entire house, at first I thought it was construction, but it was midnight?   I thought of all possible things it could be, but we had never heard anything like it before.  It would just get louder and quieter, I can't even explain the noises, it sounded like muffled harsh rain (not a good example, but I can't describe it?), it was very staticy and so loud, so piercing almost?  And only in one area, the noise was coming from a distance from what we could hear.  Like around the corner?  Very creepy.   The noise would slow down and speed up, and that lasted for about 30 minutes as we watched and listened until it suddenly stopped, we heard soooo many sirens go off after that, and that lasted for 10 minutes, and then th! at also stopped all at once.   Quickly after the noises stopped, we noticed a couple bright orbs in the sky.  We noticed one while the noises were happening, but two more appeared brighter.  I live by an airport and yes, my first thought was helicopter, plane, jet, etc, ANYTHING but  but I have seen those fly overheard before many times.  We could all tell there was a difference. It was nothing we've ever seen before in the sky.  They would kind of faded in and out in a weird fuzzy way.  One of them headed in our direction overhead and we both got a better look at it, I was hanging out of the bedroom window at this point, even in the dark i could clearly see the shape was NOT a plane.  It was circular and disc like, it had a few blinking lights, and it continued to move overhead as well as the other ones surrounding it, they all spread out up until a certain point and then they just stopped and stayed there.  My mother got a video of one of the one moving towards our direction which I will email to you.   We had no idea what we were seeing but w! e just k new and could feel that it was something different.  We all got on our phones and did some research about what we saw, I even tried to see if anybody else had seen or heard things in the area.  The things we read and photos we saw were all things we were just looking at.  It was the most surreal thing, and I truly believe they were UFOs.  Something.  But not planes, there was no way.  It was so crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere about her alleged experience.

Our mailbox center is at the entrance of the community and we decided to ride our bikes to get the mail around 19:00.  We are both about 30 years old, very interested in other forms of life and UFO activity, although never seeing anything ourselves or looking for it.  As we're riding, my brother stops me and tells me to look at the weird stars above.  It was a line of stars about the length of 4 big dippers long, clustered close together.  We both quickly realized that this was not a star formation and became overcome by the size.  They soon started expanding and contracting to one another, not dramatically or quickly, but subtly.  There were at least 70 lights above, each dimming and brightening.  If they were more spread out, the average person would assume they were stars.   We then watched this massive unity of lights move across the sky from the west.  We could see a tip that was the front of what looked like t! he biggest object.  To be clear, we couldn't see any object, but because lights were around it's perimeter, we could make out the shape of the front which was pointed.  The best way to describe how it moved is almost like a caterpillar, certain parts moving away and toward each other (expanding and contracting) while the thing as a whole moved forward at the same speed.  I was in complete awe.   We watched a few planes come into view which moved much faster and were much closer than this thing, which was so far away, it had to be in space.  All the lights slowly dimmed except three at the tail of the mass, which formed a perfect triangle.  I was instantly frustrated because what I saw couldn't be explained but I was grateful my brother at least saw it, too.  The duration here was approximately 8 minutes and the size was miles long. It's unimaginable and looked like it was a detached piece of the night sky with controlled hinges that moved.

(This happened in mid July, but seemed to come from the eastern cascade ranges).  After the second and final flash, an object came over the mountain, seemingly from the source, and quickly ascended westward, with a rapid white strobe. It did not disappear, only continued to pick up speed.Soon after the flashes seemed to stop, and the clouds dissipated. I found this impossible not report.The first thought that comes to mind is government, seeing as people have  reported quite a few low flying military aircraft over the years..although this was rather unique and ""out of this world"".

Fireball might not be the best description - more like a bright white comet-shaped object (short tail) that seemed to float in the air as it moved at a good clip.  No sound and no contrail.  I observed it out of my right view as I looked south (on my way to picking up Chinese food).  I had seen similar objects the day before (November 12 - Bethesda, MD report) and on November 5 (Bethesda, MD report) and October 15 (Kensington, MD - report not filed).  The white object was high in the sky - no clouds were present.  It was moving from right to left (West to East).  Wheaton, Maryland, is about 4 miles directly north of Washington, DC, and the airspace is pretty restricted.  The object veered - or more like pivoted - southward, as if heading toward DC/Virginia.  It then completely dissipated.  It looked like it vaporized.  Not fading slowly from view, but gone.  I took a video of the incident.  The other times I saw these objects, there were either three or four together, maybe a few miles apart from each other or closer.  They may be in one field of view - kind of close but distant from each other.  It's weird - you see just one, and then there will be three or four in view.  These appear to be the same things described in the Philadelphia, PA  November 5, 2016 17:15 report of four cigar-shaped objects.  My report of November 5 was from an hour later (DC is south of Philly and the things were traveling southwesterly when I saw them).

I have used a sighting made by me in 1969, which I later concluded was a flock of high flying seagulls, with the city lights reflected off their white plumage. It looked real at the time and had me convinced that I saw some UFOs. I have always been a space enthusiast and I have never doubted the existence of extraterrestrial intelligent beings. During the 1960s, it was on my mind every day and I belonged to a UFO investigation society. I had a number of sightings, which I reported and they were taken very seriously by them. However, over time, and through my own investigations, I came to see that every one of my sightings had natural explanations. My sightings were still regarded by the UFO society as possible sightings, but I no longer believed in them myself. For that reason, I lost interest in that UFO society. To me, they had lost credibility and they existed purely for the purpose of sensationalizing things that people saw. As time went by, I was able to predict news reports about so called sightings of UFOs. If Venus was prominent in the sky, there were sure to be reports about UFOs. The news reporters never thought to check on such obvious things as astronomical phenomena. Some radio stations would put people on the air and to let them give a full, hair raising, account of what they saw. For instance, I remember one guy telling the listeners about how he was ‘followed’ by a UFO. I knew that it was Venus. I had already expected to hear such reports that night. By 1970, I had become thoroughly skeptical about the whole subject of UFOs.  I have seen helium balloons, hot air plastic bags (garbage bags), bright stars (such as Venus), comets of various colors and sizes, aircraft nose landing lights, helicopter search lights, Earth satellites, weird cloud formations, electric sub stations blown up by lightning (more than once), unusual forms of atmospheric lightning and more (too many to mention); all of which (if photographed or videoed) could be describes as a UFO.  When you are driving in a car, anything low in the sky, will appear to follow you. Anything strange, will become a UFO. Since then, I have studied astronomy.  I have still my belief in the existence of extraterrestrial intelligent beings.  However, I now realize that interstellar travel is impossible.  The distances are so great that they are beyond our comprehension.  With our chemical fuel propulsion, it would take the best part of a million years to travel the distance.  When we become more advanced, it may only take a few thousand years. However, we can not stock up a spaceship with that many provisions, for that length of time. We are talking about hundreds of generations of humans. By the time they get there, they will no longer remember why they came. Imagine, the stone age til now. While travel is impossible, communication is actually possible. We are able to communicate at the speed of light. We could communicate with ET from our closest star, using current technology. It is a 4.5 year trip each way. We could communicate with thousands of star systems, in our own stellar neighborhood, all within a century in distance.  That is where our contact with ET will be. Communicating with ET will allow us to send emails, email attachments such as photographs and scans of all our knowledge.  They will be able to send us their DNA code and we will be able to construct an alien right here on Earth, using their DNA code.  They will be able to send us all their knowledge and we will advance a thousand years in a decade.  They can send us their smells, their landscape photos and their DNA code of unique plants. That is where the future of ET and us will be. In communication.  Not in travel.  DNA code transmission is a little like tele-transportation and it will be done at the speed of light.  No years of acceleration and de-acceleration at each end.  It will be light speed from start to finish and the result will be the same as if we had traveled the distance.  We can have an ET here and they can have an Earthling there.  All at the speed of light. If there are Aliens in our vicinity, their molecules would not have traveled the impossible distances in space, they would have been constructed right here, using their transmitted DNA code.  No ET will ever travel those distances, but ET will be here one day.  We have the technology now. All we have to do is to find them and ring them up. I thank you for your attention to this brief note. Many regards to you all From Australia",2016-12-05T00:00:00,,

Dog chased it off. It disappeared from head to toe while running It's been years, but I need to get this out there.  What I saw was not a UFO.  I was on the phone and I walked outside.  I stood there talking for a moment and the dog, Chance our German Shepard started growling.  When I looked up to see what she was growling at, staring straight back at me was an alien.  He was kneeling beside a tree.  I looked it up and down. The big black eyes you always hear about.  No nose, just holes where it should be.  No lips. Just holes where the ears should be.  On each hand a thumb and three long fingers.  I couldnt see his feet.  But he was skinny.  So skinny I could see his bones through his skin.  Like he was malnourished.  I was in complete shock and didnt even notice whether or not my step dad was still talking in my ear.  I didn't even think to use it to take a picture and I wish i would have.  All I could think was why are you staring at me?  And why don't you seem to be bothered the dog is growling at you.  It was a moment that seemed like forever.  Chance was growling in a way I had never heard before.  A growl that would send shivers down anyone's spine.  Finally she got louder and started to bark.  Then finally it looked down at her.  She got up,  it ran.  As it stood up, I was in shock at how tall it was.  6 feet at least. maybe 7.  As it ran and Chance barked I screamed for her to stop.  I'm not sure if I was screaming, because I was scared she would catch it, or if I was scared she would get hurt.  But as it ran, it started to literally disappear, starting at its head.  As i watched it disappear, I was shocked to only be able to see legs running without a visible body.  Like it was being camouflaged or something.  Once it completely disappeared, Chance stopped running, but kept barking.   I went and got my boyfriend out of the house.  We looked for footprints in the dirt.  Nothing.  There was nothing.  I then tried to deny it to myself.  I didn't just see that.  I didn't just see that.  I've pushed it out of my mind for yeas and now! at night I can't lay in bed without thinking about it.  The way he stared at me shakes me to the core.  I just keep wondering why...why was he there?  Why was he staring at me?  I wish with all my heart I had never seen that.

I started off towards the lights with Canella, climbing up to the area with pottery to get a better look. It was further than I thought, back into the dry river bed.  As I made my way to the location the light appeared to be coming from I noticed the prickly pear and other various plants were swaying, as if a wind was blowing that could not be felt. I found it odd, so I sat down for another smoke to watch.  Getting up, I started my way down into the river bed, only to find the lights were above the next ridge.  I soon noticed the large rocks off to the side behaving strangely, as if they were living.  I kept up m! y pace though and began climbing up to the source of the light.  What happened next only can be remembered in fragments, as if I were drunk (which I was not). I got to the top and whar I seen was a large, rectangular light source.  Like a huge LED screen facing towards the ground about 25ft off the ground.  The lights were fluid, no single source of color.  Underneath was a short, humanoid figure.  Dressed in what seemed to be like oil but skin tight.  On it was a sort of mask or visor. It had numerous attachments on the front and emitted a soft glow.  Memory fades.

We both love to star gaze and decided to do so after leaving a friend's house.  We drove to our favorite secluded spot almost exactly one mile from our home.  Upon arriving, we turned off the truck and headlights.   We immediately noticed a green light about 2 and a half to 3 feet above the ground.  We both noticed after a few seconds that it was moving.  It was moving in such a way that it looked like it was a bobble head.  The terrain in this field is bumpy and could be an explanation for this movement.  Anyhow, we keep watching in awe at this green light moving.  It made no noises at all.  We then notice that it's moving toward us.  I immediately get freaked out and want to leave.  My husband who is more curious than I am, decides to get out his spotlight to shine on this green orb light to see what it is.  Oddly, when he shines his bright spotlight on it, it starts re! tracting.  Still looking ""bobbily"".   We know that it was retracting because the light was getting smaller and you could visibly tell it was moving backwards.  He stops shining the light on it and it would start coming back towards us.  It was like this green light was ""scared"" of the bright spotlight. He did this off and on for about 10 minutes.  While we were sitting there his truck dash lights and headlights flickered a few times and it made a clicking sound when the lights flashed.  The truck was off and had been off since we pulled up.  Before I could convince him to leave he took pictures of the green light.  We left. We returned at daylight and could see these very narrow tracks in the same spot we saw this light.  I will also add that there are no houses within 200 yards either way where this light was.  There were also no vehicles or other people around.  I also want to add to this that the reason I wanted to leave after shortly arriving is because I felt t! hreatened some how by this green orb light.

Being confined by language, with the additional restriction of vocabulary, it is difficult to convey individual knowledge, but this is what I must try to do.  I live in a condo in this small town, overlooking Lake Michigan and also overlooking a park located to my Southeast.  From this park, the Town celebrates three or four festivals every year, including of course July 4.  This fireworks display is clearly visible from my third floor (lakeside) deck and I intended to watch the 2016 display but was reading and forgot about it, until I heard the first Boom.  But as I went out to watch I was attracted to a small bright light out over the lake, directly east and moving north.  This was odd because there is never a light out over the lake at night but I thought it was probably a helicopter, moving at about that speed, headed toward Green Bay.  Then things changed.   As I watched, the light suddenly made a sharp left turn and started in my direction (and the direction of the fireworks).  I keep a pair of binocs hanging on the deck door and wanted to get them but was afraid I'd lose the light, now a bright orange and getting brighter as it got neared but finally hurried to get them.  Sure enough, the orange light was gone.  I'd lost it.   So it was back to the fireworks with some disappointment, until I realized it was not gone but had changed from the very bright orange lights to smaller, dimmer blinking ones, obviously on the bottom of something very large.  At that hour of the night, all I could see were the lights but by now the object was much closer, just offshore and slightly to the northeast of my position and of the fireworks display.  And though it was quite dark, there was the impression that the craft was triangular.  It held its position totally silent and motionless for six to eight minutes, as though someone in it was curious about the fireworks.   Then as I watched with the glasses it seemed like someone aboard flipped a switch.  The white, blinking bottom lights (levitating?) went out and the two very large and extremely bright orange ones snapped back on, ambient light illuminating the entire rear (power?) end of the craft, giving me a very clear view.  There still were no sidelights so impossible to determine actual size or shape, only the impression of big and triangular.  It sat immobile and silent for another couple of minutes and then moved leisurely to the southeast until it disappeared over the lake horizon, obviously abandoning its original destination.   Most interesting about this event is what it tells us about the beings involved, that is:  we are not being visited by preprogrammed probes but by ships was under intelligent guidance, they are not from our own future (not interested in fireworks), not our military for the same reason, and obviously not interested in direct communications so far.  I do a considerable amount of rendering and have made one of that part of the craft made visible by the large orange lights which I shall try to include.  Not a computer literate, but will give it a try. ((NUFORC Note:  This report was originally posted with a date of June 4th, 2016.

My husband and I took an Alaskan cruise for our 10th anniversary.  It was through the inside passage going past Canada and stopping at Ketchikam, Juneau, and Skagway.  We had a cabin with a small veranda on the port side of the ship.   I have insomnia so at about 1:30 a.m., I was still awake.  My husband was fast asleep and I didn't know what to do with myself so I decided to sit on the veranda.  The veranda was very small just big enough for two chairs and a very small table.  The veranda was covered by the floor of the veranda on the deck above us so to see directly above the ship you had to lean out.  The area directly below the ship and maybe 40 feet out could be seen because the ship had some lights on.  The area had fog rolling in in patches.  I was looking out over the water, towards the land, and then up at the sky. In between wispy patches of fog, the sky was clear.  I started noticing a small ""lighter"" area in the clear sky that would come from directly above the ship and move more west then go back over the ship.  When it went back over the ship I couldn't see it anymore.  I decided to get our binoculars that my husband had bought for our trip. They are very expensive binoculars with image stabilizers. I retrieved them and went back outside.  I was leaning over the railing trying to see if the ""lighter"" area would come back and sure enough it did, moving westward again.  I looked through the binoculars and couldn't believe what I was seeing.   There were 6 dull yellow oval orbs flying in a group.  I can only explain the movement was like animals moving together and ""jostling"" each other. I ran in to wake my husband.  He wasn't happy about it, but he went on the veranda half asleep.  I explained what I saw but they were gone.  He went back to bed. This happened 2 more times.  I would see the group coming from over the ship and I would get my husband until he finally said he didn't care if it landed, he didn't want me to wake him again.   The ship had 11 decks and on the t! op deck there are no cabins, it's where the main restaurant is and from mid section of ship to the aft end is completely open.  I decided to go up to that deck where I can observe directly over the ship. I was a little apprehensive as it was by this time 2 in morning.  There were some crew members but I didn't see any passengers.  I asked a crew member if they had any lights that shone up toward the sky and he said no.  I did not see the lights again.",2016-12-05T00:00:00,,

I live just outside my hometown Kokomo and Russiaville, Indiana.  I was on my way into work driving from 26 to Dixon road heading north towards Mikes Pizza and the Speedway.  At first I only saw a couple and thought it wasn't anything special because I always am searching the skies and usually find nothing.  There were a few ahead of the rest and at first I thought it was a few of planes, but they had no sound and glides like dancing orange balls.  2 leading and 1 dancing around them.   Have you ever watched how ash off of a campfire floats away off the amber?  This is how the entire group was moving but one of them seemed to enjoy moving back and forth up and down dancing with the rest in this same motion. As I passed Center round heading towards alto the orbs had fallen down a lot to a point where I could see very clear it wasn't any plane or flares.  I called my wife in excitement telling her I had just seen 3 orbs dancing in the sky heading from the west to the east, as if they were coming from Russiaville area.  As I quickly approached Alto road I was still looking around to keep my eyes on them.  This is when I noticed the massive group of about 7-8 more.  They were not in any particular order or formation. I quickly told my wife I would call her back because I had to get some kind of proof of what I was seeing.  I pulled over and got the best video recording of it on my phone.  Had I seen the entire group earlier I would have pulled off the road much earlier when I was closer to them to get a better recording.  They glided in the sky farther away and extremely quick as if they were just passing by and on a mission.  It was truly magnificent to see. In the short video clip, 975 o! f excitement I called them crafts but they weren't.  They were orange red -ish orbs and seemed very peacefully in the air.  This is the second event in Kokomo I have experienced but first time ever getting something caught on camera.  In 2008 and 2013 we had similar glowing orbs flying in the sky as well. When I was underneath them, they seemed to act alive and not like a vehicle of some sort.  My thoughts would be the orbs were entities themselves passing by or through our deminsion or realm.  They glided up and down and moved left to right in a clean soundless dancing motion.  This is why I did not think they were flares or Chinese candles.  They moved too quickly and decisively in an intelligent manor.",2016-12-05T00:00:00,40.48414571428571,-86.12858523809524

About ten minutes later the object dropped rapidly and then came back up, the red and green lights were still lit up on the object the whole time hovering over the same location.  my roommate and i were trying to figure out whats going on and what is it.  I thought it was a drone or something.  Around 8:45 pm we noticed a small,white, clear, rectangular shaped object gliding around the corner towards us.  As it came closer i noticed a bright light in side of the object that looked like a light bulb. it was gliding towards us slowly.  The object was actually within our reach.  The object changed its form into a golden sphere, but it looked like a cage that was shaped into a sphere.  It was still gliding towards us, the object still had the golden light inside of it.  The object flew higher and started to travel to the right of us, i caught that part on video.  The object changed its form again into some sort of mechanical ball, it then folded itself and disappeared.  My room mate started to scream dial 911, and I called channel 7 news.

After a long day of work, I retired to my bed and ready to sleep.  I also had a lunch meet-up appointment with my buddy on the next day so I went to bed by midnight, which was earlier than my usual Friday night sleep time. Perhaps sometime at 1 or 2 am, I was awake but still in my bed.  There was a bright white light emitting from my 4 o'clock (my head is at 12 o'clock position as a reference).  The light came from a white ball of light. It was so bright that my eyes were filled with tears and I had to turn my head slightly to the left to avoid it.  The light was so white and bright like it was coming from either a high power flood light or the sun.  It must be noted that although the washroom light was on during the night and it was in the vicinity of my bed, it was a energy saving light bulb and its colour was yellowish dim. I remember that right before I turned my head, there was a tingling sensation in my breathing tube traveling upward between my collar bone to my jaw.  It was itching and I remember that I brushed my neck with both hands downward. I don't remember seeing any entities or physical contacts during the entire event and I was laid down on my bed the entire time;  I also dont remember if my lower body was immobile. The next day, I got up with the sense of a bit restless but didnt give much thought. My friend later noticed that I was behaving a little bit agitated while I was looking for a parking spot at mall. It could be the result of the event or perhaps it was stress related. But our lunch was the last meat I have eaten for the past three months. Somehow that encounter changed my diet habit and I dont find red meat and chicken appetizing anymore.  My diet has become almost vegetarian.  I do eat fish and seafood from time to time, but I know I can also live without them.  My weight dropped and I felt more healthy and my brain more active for all these months. What really blew my mind was a physical evidence that I cannot simply treat this as a dream or human psychological response to stress.  This event had left a physical mark on my chest.  I found it very similar to the scoop mark left on some of the abductees' bodies.  It has been three months since the event and that mark still remains in its original shape and colour.  There is no other physical symptoms, pain or itching coming from it.  Of course, it wasnt there before and no scratch cannot heal in three months. I don't sense it was a malevolent encounter and I have not had another one since then, or at least any that I can remember.",2016-12-05T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

The color though was strange.  It glowed and was almost like blue green, but more green then anything.  I almost wrecked my car and asked my son if he had just seen what I did.  He said yes, and asked what it was.  I really couldn't explain it. A few minutes later, we arrived at home.  We both are getting out of the car, when I hear a faint noise above me.  It's not loud like an airplane or a helicopter, but I could hear something.  I mentioned the sound being weird to my son, and as I said that I noticed he was staring up into the sky asking me what he was looking at.  So I looked and it was this huge, triangle, thing hovering in the sky.  It was moving, but at a pace where it was slow enough to watch.  I stared at it in pure disbelief.  It was triangular in shape, black or like a very dark gray in color, had a circle on the bottom with lines through it of what I could see and a red light on each corner of the triangle.  It was also very low.  If it would have come down a few like 12 feet further, it would have hit the tops of the houses where I live. My son was so scared and was yelling for me to go inside, but all I could do was stand there and watch it move.  It took about 7 minutes to fully disappear back into the sky, but was gone just as fast as it appeared. A few days later the electric in my home started going haywire.  I would come home from work to see all of my clocks blinking.  I had to reset things in my house about 7 times over the last 2 weeks but no one else in our area had any kinds of issues.

Iam a drone owner as well, and this was not the behavior of a drone with zig! zag action or it's type of lights. about a minute of observat! ion, we agreed the craft with this behavior easily was in the measurement of 100ft across at least as it dwarfed the structures below on the hills at an 1500-2000ft elevation above the hills. slowly and gradually the craft turned easily north east gradually gaining altitude as it flew over the 101FWY Cahuenga Pass. About after another minute it was clear the craft was gracefully gaining extreme altitude, and due to elevation it's craft detail was getting smaller as it finally settled over the Hollywood sign mountain. The craft peaked about 5000ft above the mountain and paused it's NE direction. it hovered still perfectly without a bump for about another minute. Through this time again the craft was gaining more altitude. about another 30 seconds of this slow climb, the craft slowly flew southward to our direction. the honey-combed lit pattered was so tiny from it's height, yet still identifiable. it's movement and behavior resembled that of high space satellite. the craft eventually! was now spotted by two more witnesses as they were entering the cafe, as we were all in agreement of tracking the craft. The slow path and asension ended directly above us about 7000-8000ft as it hovered in place for another 5 minutes. as the craft paused, to our view it parked itself near two stars creating an even triangle constellation of sorts. these two stars' location are the first pair NE of the orion left shoulder. after this pause the craft gained an altitude in where it now resembled that of a tiny satellite, or the size of the neighboring stars, and like a slow satellite it traveled directly west over west hollywood as it's slow path was just north of the Orion constellation. the object was exactly star size as it faded westward gaining altitude, yet still identifiable well past west of Hollywood Blvd & Fairfax blvd. the entire event was about 27 minutes as it was slow and gradual as stated before. i then cell phoned west Hollywood sheriff to report the sighting! and the officer stated there were no reports of the event. i ! then con tacted the next major airport at Burbank which was about 12 miles away. by this hour the airport has stopped it's regular commercial airline service at 10pm that night. i got through to Burbank tower security who accepted my story and he then transferred me to the actual tower. a stand by night watch tech took my call. I asked if anyone was watching radar in the south direction of 2:17am. he stated he wasn't watching radar at that time. iIdescribed my sighting to him, he sounded interested, but after he claimed he still never had evidence on radar, nor looked, therefore he stated he had to go and hung up on me. this craft had no similarity to the usual police helicopters or commercial aircraft that we see by the dozens daily in the area with our 3 major commercial airports. We do have Edwards afb but it's a 2 hours drive north. but this was no stealth plane outline nor was it the dark large air force x-baloon triangle ship. we haven't had lighted blimps in years since Goodye! ar stopped that action, nor could a blimp fly that hight out of sight or hover in place. it was not a large manned drone, as it would have been way too small in dimension, also the guide lights on a drone were not the same. nor could a drone have scaled that altitude for that duration and without one single abrupt zig zag kind movement. our sighting was a big luminous craft, with smooth acceleration, ending in high altitude without a flinch. lots of citizens in L.A., please respond if there are any other eyewitnesses. sighting was 2:17 - 2:45am 11/4/2016",2016-12-05T00:00:00,,

They almost looked like little flames fading in and out. They glowed bright, way brighter than stars.  They would fade out, and then repeat again approximately 5-6 more times over the next 10 minutes.   We were already beginning descent into Fairbanks, which was overcast and snowing.  I kept watching for more, but lost the entire field of view as we descended into the clouds and then landed.  Fairbanks was socked in with snow, so there was no way this could have been seen from town if looking southeast towards the Alaska Range.  I have no idea what this was.

She sat down to take a short break and scanned the sky. Watching the sky when we are outside is and has been a habit we've adopted over the last 2-3 years.  A minute or two into her break she noticed an object in the northeastern sky and pointed it out to me. It was difficult to locate but I was able to do so by using environmental reference points such as trees and the house.  What I saw appeared to me at first like a bright star as it was a stationary object but considering the time of day and the fact it was sunny and 65 degrees made this an unlikely explanation.  I cannot stress enough how difficult it was to see this thing. Unless you had your eyes directly trained on it, it vanished from sight even though it seemed to be metallic and reflecting sunlight. If my wife wouldn't have spotted it there's no way I would have seen it.  At this moment, I ran inside to get my son to see it for himself, which he did but only after directing him where to look exactly.  We sat there staring at it when my wife pointed out two other objects approaching from the southeast.  One looked like the object to the north but moving slow and the other had a reddish color but seemed to bend and twist as it moved towards our direction.  It changed course a few times going left or right and moved at about half the speed of a mid to high altitude airliner appears to move.  These objects also seemed to ""disappear"" when not focused directly on them so when I looked away it took effort to find them once again. At this point I ran into the house to get my camcorder which is a Panasonic HC-W570.  I knew that I had 35-40 minutes of battery left but when I got outside and started to try and find the objects again, the battery indicator dropped all the down and I didn't even get a chance to record a single frame before it just died.  Disappointed, my family and I continued to watch.  The two moving o! bjects h ad fully vanished or faded but the original one still remained.  That's when I had the idea to grab the power supply for the camcorder and plug it in to an exterior outlet at the front door. It took me a few minutes to get close to zooming in on the UFO as the camera doesn't have a physical viewfinder, only the lcd screen.  Zooming into 90x also makes any handheld camerawork very unstable. Eventually, using the trees in the front of the house as a reference for locating the object in the sky, I got lucky for just a couple seconds to be able to get it in focus.  Almost as if it was playing hard to get, it would move just close enough to the tree in my line of sight for the camera to lose focus and shift to focusing on the branches.

Date:  November 7, 2016.   Approximate Time:  Between 6:55 and 7:00 pm   Location: Snohomish, WA  Latitude and Longitude:  Will be submitted in hardcopy report  Night Sky:  Clear with a First Phase Moon    MY IMPRESSION: I was driving my grandchildren home on November 7, 2016, approximately 7:00 pm.  As I turned onto their street, I was mesmerized and held captive by what I saw and told the children to look up in the sky.  My 8 year old grandson exclaimed, “Nonna, what is that?”  I said it looks like some kind of UFO craft?   I slowed the car down and then stopped to view and it just seemed to drop or disappear below the tree line.   I quickly put the car in reverse to see if my position was the reason I could no longer see, but the objects were gone, no lights could be seen between the trees or in the night sky anywhere ~ they disappeared as quickly as they appeared.  As I pulled into my son’s driveway I told my grandson to go get his father while I unpacked the car all the while my 5 year old granddaughter was crying as she was frightened.  When my son came out of the house and we both heard and saw a very loud helicopter across the Valley in the vicinity of Harvey Air Field. It took a couple of days to process everything, but I did write everything down and attempted a crude drawing.  I knew I had to investigate further before submitting a report and contacted Harvey Air Field to have them check their Manifest to see if any helicopters were in the air around 7:00 pm on November 7th.  There were no helicopters at that time in the air - DEAD END. Later that day, I learned that there was in fact a helicopter in that vicinity and that they were doing Military Maneuvers. RECONSTRUCTING THE SIGHTING In an attempt now to reconstruct the shape and dimension of the crafts (I’ll  describe as objects for the time being), I first drew a large triangle and then at each of the three points I drew triangles - three equilateral as well as equidistant shaped triangles. Each triangular object was lit up with bright white lights that appeared to run along vertical lines moving upward to the top of the triangle which had pink or red lights at the base. The night sky was clear and the objects were illuminated by an unusually bright half moon.  Later, I looked up to see if there was in fact a half moon and learned it was a First Quarter Moon. There was no sound whatsoever and the objects seemed very close.  I don’t have the ability or science background to be able to report the exact size of the objects in relation to the planets and to the moon, but I know without a shadow of a doubt that what I saw were not planets or stars. When one sees planets and stars in the night sky they appear as tiny white dots, but what we saw were distinct objects ‘up close and personal’  as they say, clearly illuminated by the brightly lit moon. FINAL IMPRESSION:  The entire occurrence lasted no more than a minute, but something else occurred that has taken time for me to process as it defies logic.  As the objects seemed to drop below the tree line and disappear, it was at this point that I briefly took my eyes off the area to put my car in reverse and that is when I had a most unusual experience when I turned back around.  I will attempt to describe. I had the impression that the objects had not disappeared but were closer, or becoming larger, and passing overhead as I could see that the center area between the three triangular points was black, darker than the night sky, and all the lights were either dimmed or turned off ~ but I could see an outline.  It  was at this point that I knew that the triangular objects I saw were not three separate objects, but one large CRAFT.   It was gone with a blink of an eye, certainly a subjective experience and difficult to describe, but it was nonetheless my experience.

A large triangular craft was flying over my property with three red flashing lights underneath in the center.  The lights were arranged in a triangle pattern and blinked on and off together at a pace of about one beat per second.  The edges of the craft were rounded and the points of the triangle were also rounded.  The underside of the craft was contoured and rolled underneath along each side and tapered out to the triangle points in a series of parallel rolls on each end. The blinking red lights appeared to be deeper set in a recess in the center of the craft.  The craft color appeared to be metallic silver.  The craft was lighted around the edges because I could see it so distinctly. The craft flew very slowly from the northwest and flew to the southeast toward the Blue Mountains.  It flew a distance of about 2 miles and was approaching the Blue Mountains when the craft appeared to be stopped in mid air for a short time and then flew on at such a slow speed it was difficult to see movement at a distance.  The blinking lights finally disappeared over the mountains.  The craft was so large that it was still very visible in the distance. The whole event took about 10  minutes.

My house sits about 500' above sea level and my thought was that the craft was far below legal limits. A few minutes later I heard what sounded like military aircraft above the fog seeming to move northward and a couple of minutes later I again heard a military sounding craft streaking above the fog - it is most unusual to have military aircraft except for the Reserve helicopters that sometimes fly in the area out of McNary Field here in Salem, Oregon.

It was loud enough that the windows on our home were shaking violently.   I grabbed my children as my first thought was that it was a crashing airplane, or a missile.  We looked up as all of the neighbors on the street exited their homes in fright.  Up high in the sky was a ""very"" large spherical object streaming through the sky at high speeds emitting light grey smoke trailing behind.  The object was metallic in appearance, shortly around 15-20 seconds into the sighting two military jets were seen flying at high speeds toward the object. It was clear at this point that the object was descending very fast towards the Rocky Mountains.  I am very familiar with all types of government aircraft, civilian and astronomical objects.  This was neither.  I'm not normally one to believe in the paranormal or extraterrestrials, but this was undeniable.

So, I turned on my spotlight and shined it in that direction.  Flicking it on and off four times.  The light dimmed to an intesity of a car headlight of a distance of approximately 3 miles.  I was able to determine the distance based on Beck Street, which is below Ensign Peak. As I watched the light it disappeared and then reappeared to the north of the peak.  It then turned off. This is not the first occurrence of this or these lights.  I first noticed them in April of 2006. A large bright light, very bright would appear west of the airport, at the north end of the Oquirrh (pronounced oker) Mountains at about an altitude of 10,000 feet.  And fly directly over the airport. This altitude was determined by a FedEx MD-11 that departed and called out his altitude of 10,500 ft.  And fly in the area and was dwarfed in size by the light. These lights travel west to east and fly directly over Ensign Peak at a speed similar to a Cessna 182.  As the light flies over in begins to descend in a straight down path approximately 10-15 miles east of the peak. This is a monthly event. These begin over the Keennecot smokestack and the do not have any identifiable type aircraft lights.  Just a solid white light. I am very familiar with aircraft.

There was little wind, when I checked the Auburn weather, the last report was just 3 MPH at 9:55 PM. The object attracted my attention for several reasons.  One, it was the color of and appeared to be on fire.  Two, I couldn’t discern that it was making any noise.  Three, it moved from that eastern view toward Seattle (a Northerly direction) until it disappeared behind a distant cloudbank.  It appeared to maintain a constant trajectory and speed.

I noticed 3 large brightly lit stars in the eastern sky. They were at the 10 o’clock and 12 o’clock positions with the third star just to the right and down of the 10 o’clock star.  The 10 o’clock star was flashing red, green and blue.  The 10 o’clock and 12 o’clock stars also had an elongated or even an 8 shape to them.  Suddenly the third star shot down at a 45 degree to earth.  It did not have a tail.  It was a perfect bright circle. About 5 minutes later, a fourth bright star from about the 12 o’clock position shot straight down.  These falling stars landed very far away. I continued to watch the skies for about 2 more minutes when I noticed movement on the street in front of my home.  (The street is about 50 feet from my window.)  What I saw is very hard to describe, so here goes... “It” was about 6 feet tall and 8 to 10 feet long and in the shape of a flat and slightly distorted semicircle with no real volume or thickness. “It” was see through and did not have any defining edges. I must add that it did not shine or glisten in any way, but  did have a faint light gray color to it. I was able to see it because of the faint color distorting the corn stalks on the other side of it into a blur as it glided down the street. The speed of the glide was a casual walking pace. Anticipation grew within me as it neared the corner street light. If my eyes were playing a trick on me, the light would surely show what was truly there.  Now I could see what it really was in the light,but just before it got to the light, it disappeared. I continued to watch the skies and the street but nothing new happened until my husband walked into the room a few minutes later.  I told him that something amazing just happened but first to look at the two bright stars in the sky.  He too noticed the flashing colors of the 10 o’clock star.  I was watching the sky at the time but he averted his gaze to the street. He saw something too.  I asked him to describe in full detail what it was in size, shape,color etc. He described exactly what I saw just a few minutes earlier.  His encounter was exactly the same as mine,right down to the way it moved (glided). We agreed that it reminded us of the movie “Predator” with Arnold Schwarzenegger.  You have to actually LOOK for the disfigurations to really see them.        ",2016-12-05T00:00:00,41.8599,-94.445

The three lights were much brighter than the planes also in the sky and were not traveling in a particular direction.  The lights were solid and not pulsating, at first.  They were holding their triangle shape, but seemed to be rotating around a center point.  Very faintly, there appeared to be a dark mass making up the space within the triangle the lights were forming, possibly the shape of the body of a craft.  After about 10 minutes, one of the lights broke away from the other two and raced north at incredible speed, pulsated, dimmed, and completely faded from view.  The other two lights remained together in the sky, rotating and moving in conjunction with each other.  After another 10 minutes, those lights began to pulsate, as well.

This sighting was reported from several media outlets in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA)  I did not personally witness this event; I am reporting it as it was reported by the several local media outlets.  Following is a report from a large newspaper (The Toronto Star) in the area:  The pilots of a Porter Airlines flight inbound to Toronto on Monday morning were forced to put their plane into a sudden dive to avoid a mid-air collision with an unidentified object high over Lake Ontario, causing minor injuries to two flight attendants. Now investigators with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada admit they have a puzzle on their hands to determine exactly what the pilots had to avoid. “Nobody knows at this point. It happened so quick,” said Peter Rowntree, senior regional investigator with the safety board. “We’ve got our work cut out trying to figure out what this unidentified flying object was. What did they encounter?” Rowntree said in an interview. “It definitely wasn’t a bird. It was a fairly large object,” he said, describing it as up to three metres wide. There were initial concerns that the object was an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or drone, highlighting once again worries about their growing prevalence and the risks they pose to aviation. Rowntree said it was too soon to say for sure. But he said the location of the incident — at 2,743 metres (9,000 feet) over the lake near the U.S. border, far from shore — is reason for concern if it was a drone. The Porter Dash 8-400 turboprop was on its initial approach to Toronto’s Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport from Ottawa when the two pilots saw they were on a collision course. They had mere seconds to spot the object and react to avoid the danger. “They essentially just pushed the nose down to get underneath it,” Rowntree said. “It’s a big sky out there, so the fact they even saw it is something,” he said, noting that the aircraft was travelling at almost 450 kilometres per hour. Two flight attendants suffered minor injuries in the evasive manoeuvre. They were taken to hospital and released. None of the 54 passengers on board the flight were injured, airline spokesperson Brad Cicero said. At first the pilots believed the object was a balloon, but later thought it could have been a drone, Cicero said. The Toronto Star published the above article.  I removed information about this being a possible drone and the concerns about people flying drones that wasn't important regarding the sighting description.  The drone they speak of is not a military drone; as Canada doesn't appear to have such craft.  A personal drone (UAV) doesn't usually offer enough range to have been at the altitude - and distance from shore - this object was seen.  Most commercial UAV drones have a range of between 100 metres and 2000 metres.",2016-12-05T00:00:00,43.85866415929203,-79.11631415929203

I zoomed in without losing resolution and took a few more.  I examined those with my partner and he was very intrigued and we zoomed in and were awe struck.  It was a sphere but it was a moon.  It looked exactly like our moon only smaller. In the photos, there is a visible lens flare/glare that is bouncing off of the overhead lot lights.  This sphere/additional moon was not a lens anomaly.  To further debunk the oddity, we walked to the park in the middle of our condos.  We saw the bright big moon through the tree tops. I took out the camera and began shooting more pictures.  We figured if it was a lens or camera issue, it would project this second moon overlapping the tree branches, thus copying the image of the actual moon.  Much to our surprise, this secondary moon was shadowed by the branches in the actual placement of where it corresponds and the actual moon/supermoon was not shrouded by branches in real visual observation nor in the photograph.  This blew our minds.! We took several photos and then went inside to grab the very ! large te lephoto lens for the SLR camera and came back out.  We took more photos from the original device, my partners device, and the SLR and there was no second moon present in these photos.  So this phenomenon was present for roughly 5-7 minutes then gone.",2016-12-05T00:00:00,32.88038143913921,-96.96644082044385

She started to discredit me, but as soon as she looked at it, she went dead silent and just watched. The one light almost grew and then separated into five separate lights close together and all of the same color and unstable.

(the best description I have for this shape are those concept photos of what cloud cities would look like on Venus)  I felt a drop in my stomach because at first, I honestly thought it was an incoming meteor and even swerved my car out of shock from these lights.  They were clearly spinning and blinking blue and white lights, and the other few objects, other than the cloud city-looking one, almost had a saucer shape to them when I looked through binoculars when I arrived home.  (which these lights were totally visible the entire night, from the highway and then from my home in Methuen as well) I grabbed my iPhone and started recording when I got home, and when I was watching the video I took from my street, you can't see much, but you can tell that although the lights were stationary, they were clearly moving and hovering, and you can even see the succession of colors it was giving off.  Now at first, I thought these may have been drones, but I witnessed them stay aligned in a swooping line under the moon and continue to blink and hover in the same exact position until 3:30am the following morning! I had my father verify that these lights were indeed there and that I was not crazy for thinking there were strange lights locked in with the moon's path across the night sky. He isn't a believer either, but he was stumped by what we were witnessing, and even took a few looks through the binoculars to make sure they w! ere really there hovering!  What's even more interesting, is that two n ights later, when the clouds broke for a few at night, I could see the possibly saucer-shaped, blue and white flashing light again, in the same exact position, not moving but clearly hovering and spinning!  I have been doing some research, and the only possible report of UFOs that matched my description, were seen traversing in front of the sun and interacting with said star two days before I saw what I saw; they were blue and white orbs and they were witnessed possibly taking energy from our sun, and I am starting to wonder if what I saw was maybe one of these orbs, much smaller, viewing the Earth and keeping a close eye as there mothership interacts with our sun (maybe to prevent the earthlings from acting on this giant object near our sun!) who knows, I just know what I saw and I will try to figure out a way to post the videos I have, zoomed in and more focused on the objects.",2016-12-05T00:00:00,42.7324,-71.1862

They began accelerating and decelerating at speeds impossible for any known aircraft.  Our guess was going from speeds of 200mph to 2,500 mph back to 200 mph in one second.  Another smaller formation followed, this time one of the crafts did a quick circles around another at a speed again at a speed impossible for any known man made craft.

I saw what appeared to be lights outside that lit up and cast shadows on my front door’s window.  ((NUFORC Note:  Meteor??

When I reviewed the footage, I saw what appeared to be lights outside that lit up and cast shadows on my front door’s window in an unusual way. The door that the lights appeared through is on the second floor facing the North, towards a street in Key Colony Beach, Florida, that has a speed limit of 25 MPH (West Ocean Drive) directly across from a restaurant named the Key Colony Inn, with four palm trees in close proximity (within 20 feet) of it. Anyway, I showed the footage to a few of my colleagues at work.  The most viable explanation that any of them provided was a search light from a helicopter.  We have had a lot of Cubans making landfall, via water on crude rafts, in an attempt to establish citizenship in the USA recently, so, it made sense, and I dismissed it as such. However, after work, I reviewed the footage on the larger screen of my computer, turned up the volume, and then slowed it down to see frame-by-frame detail.  Upon doing so, it appeared to me as though it was unlikely this was from a helicopter.  For one, there was no audible noise, other than a low continuous white noise from a box fan, that was set to low, on the other side of the kitchen wall in the foreground of the video.   Second of all, there seemed to be four light source locations in the three seconds or so that it lasted, and those lights did not seem to sweep from side to side; rather, they seemed to be moving, primarily from right to left (East to West) based on how the shadows of the palm trees and railing outside were cast on the window of the door.  Not to mention the lights did not seem to be originating from high enough to support the helicopter theory. I have also tried to dismiss this as electricity arcing from the power lines to palm trees that are in the general direction of the light sources in the video (about 100 feet from the door), as they are very close to the power lines; however, I would think that an arc this bright should make a noise.  Please correct me if I am wrong. The first light source, based on the height of the railing in relation to the shadow that was cast on the door, as well as the palm frond that is most likely casting a shadow on the door, seems to have originated from the parking lot of the condominium complex to the West of the one that I live in, or slightly closer, but in line with that parking lot.  It also looks as though there was two light sources, one dimmer and slightly lower than the other, as the top of the concrete railing, that is outside the door, has a double shadow. The second and third light sources seen seem to be traveling primarily from East to West, very rapidly at one point, based on the sudden change of the railing shadow position from one frame to the next, yet it is a bit more confusing, as far as source position and direction of travel; however, I believe it is actually two light sources that come close together, as it is nearly void of a palm tree shadow after a few frames, and at that time it is casting an overlapping shadow of the diamond shapes present in the concrete railing. The fourth light source is only visible for about four frames (two frames of bright light); however, the light source seems to be a little more visible in the window. I am not an expert at assessing light sources by examining shadows.  However, it would appear as though all of the lights came from the same area, and not very far from my apartment, as I took photographs from outside to see where a source would need to be to cast shadows from the various palm trees on the window of the door. I’ll be emailing the video clip, as well as the photographs of the area outside the door, to include a photo that shows the view seen from inside the door, looking out, as well as a snip from Google Earth that shows the location of my apartment with a blue dot. I’ve been scratching my head for a couple of days now, and decided to reach out to the experts to help try to make sense of this event. Thank you for any input you can provide about this matter.",2016-12-05T00:00:00,24.721,-81.0187

At 4:17 on 11/22/2016 on Route 111 in Atkinson, New Hampshire, below a cloud cover, hovered an unknown, potentially hazardous object. The object, initially appearing to be a star or planet, emitted a strong white light.  It would have been impossible to determine this object as a star or planet as the sun was in full shine and the object was against the backdrop of the cloud cover. 	While first being obscured by the powerful luminescence it emanated, a witness travelled on the road, growing closer to the object.  To the witness, this craft was nearly indistinguishable from the altitude of approximately 3,300 feet above sea level. However, what appeared to be a metallic object with the shape of  4 claw-like arms emitting a white light became apparent as the witness drew closer.  Approximately 5 minutes after the initial sighting, the craft accelerated at an extraordinarily fast speed directly up into the cloud cover. 	The witness’s motor vehicle was temporarily incapacitated by what appeared to be the movement of the craft.  Lights, heating systems, and windows ceased function for 11 seconds.  There was no apparent stalling of the engine. 	15 minutes later, near the junction of South Road, Brentwood, and Exeter Road, Exeter, the object reappeared to the same witness, this time in much closer vicinity, approximately 1,000 feet above the ground.  The shape of the object was not of human design that we know of. Four appendages, each extending from a single circular base, formed a claw shape, with each “claw” pointing downwards at the surface. The object was a silvery-black metallic color, and pulsed several times with white lights.  At this point, malfunctions in most systems of the car began to occur.  Heating was cut, electricity went dead, and the engine stalled as the car pulled to a stop.  At this time, there was nobody else on the road. The witness noticed a strange, constant howling noise coming from the craft, almost like an animal scream combined with the running of a jet engine.  The object or craft hung over the road for several more seconds, before shooting up into the sky with what sounded like a sonic boom, or a similar explosion sound.  Directly after the object disappeared, the car’s systems rebooted and the witness continued on his way home.",2016-12-05T00:00:00,42.83710000000001,-71.1599

This is important to this event, as it means I was in my home alone, with no one to catch a missing time event.  Although I completely believe in aliens and UFO's, I have never seen one before.  My background is in both Accounting and Computer Technology. On the night of Nov 22nd, 2016, I had my AM radio set to listen to Coast2Coast at 9pm as I often do. However, that night's repeat program of the previous night was about The US Dollar and such, and the topic did not interest me.  I turned off the radio and set it aside. I browsed the Internet for a short period of less than 1/2 hour or so, and decided to go to bed. Glancing at the clock, I remember it to be approx 9:30pm.  Maybe 9:25pm Closing the living room blinds, I noticed 2 aircraft outside in the sky.  That is common, as there is a nearby airport.  However, both craft were stationary, and I could not hear any sound of helicopters.  The bodies of the crafts were not visible, just a single dim yellow light, and a stronger red light that was flashing.  I assumed them to be standard hovering helicopters, with an aviation beacon on the bottom. If you held a ruler up against the window, the craft would have been about 10"" apart, which was close enough that I could see both together. I thought it strange that two craft were allowed to fly so close to each other. I glanced to the right (South / East ) over Lake Ontario, and saw a very bright and large star. However, the star was fiercely shimmering/twinkling, and was larger than any star I've seen. It was round, and seemed to be spinning.  Every colour was flashing in split seconds. Red/Green/Blue/White/Yellow. Like as diamond - flashing rainbow colours of light.  But clearly spinning.   My eyes went back and forth between the 2 stationary crafts and the ""star"" and I blurted out ""They're watching it too!!""  At this point, I became excited at the thought it may be a UFO, as I have never seen one before. I grabbed a pair of binoculars from a cabinet next to me, and tried to view the ""star"" through the window but it was not clear.  The binoculars are inexpensive 7x35 magnification. Next to the window, is a door to my patio. Standing in the doorway, I looked directly South / East over Lake Ontario at the ""star"", looking at it with bare eyes, watching it spin with fantastic split-second colours. I held up the binoculars, and tried to focus more, but the focus was almost at the 'infinity' setting of the focus ring,  and no fine adjustment could improve the view. However, the binoculars did allow me to see the same round shape, clearly spinning, showing amazing colours. But no further definition of the object.  I said out loud, ""We see you. We're watching you, whatever you are."" Jokingly expecting it to respond by zooming away. It did not. It was far too large to be a star. I became very excited and scrambled to put on shoes and coat and grabbed my cell phone to take a picture. I ran outside. The sky was jet black, and I could see the 'star' clearly. Also, I looked to my left (North) and vertically upward and could see lights of the 2 craft hovering in the same position above me. Still only could see each as a dim yellow light, with a red flashing beacon light next to it. I was not interested in them, and did not pay much attention to any of their specs. I turned my attention back to the spinning 'star'. I was clearly spinning and showing fantastic lights. Binoculars confirmed the object to be round, spinning , and multi coloured. No further definition. I was panicking at what to do next. I did not want to lose the moment. I held my cell phone up at arm's length to the 'star' and it only appeared as a tiny white dot in the screen. At arm's length, I could see both the tiny picture dot on the screen and the actual 'star' in the distance, just above the phone. I knew that would show nothing in a photo.  I decided to try the movie application, thinking that it may better show the fantastic light show, rather than a still picture dot.  I brought my cell phone close to me and pressed the buttons to start the movie mode, and stretched my arms out again with the cell phone at arm's length trying to find the white dot ( the spinning star) again.  The dot was nowhere to be found on the screen, so I looked at the actual sky, and the 'star' was now just a teeny tiny dot in the dark sky. The same size as a star would expected to be. Far off in the distance out over Lake Ontario. This actual star in the night sky did not register on my camera screen at all now. It was too small. The spinning 'star' had gone. I looked back toward the 2 craft and saw only dark night sky. They were also gone. Higher in the sky over Lake Ontario was the constellation Orion. Because the night sky was so dark and clear, I could see all the stars, especially the 3 of the belt.  Following the belt downward, I could see Sirius. It was certainly not the spinning colourful object I had been watching. My cell phone has Stellarium on it. I opened the app and held my phone up to confirm Orion and Sirius, but I already knew them. I stood there in disbelief. I was angry. I was emotionally upset and frustrated. I had lost my chance to record the spinning object. I had been rushing in a frantic state trying to capture something I knew could end at any time. And I did not succeed. This whole event from first seeing them outside the other window to re-entering my home, lasted only about 10 minutes. It was fast and furious.  And now I was emotionally upset. Turned back to the door, I went inside and went on the Internet on a computer within steps of the door.  I Google'd Orion and Sirius and confirmed the stars I now saw were those I already knew.  But what happened to the larger spinning ball?  I walked over the doorway again, and stared up at the night sky, hoping it would happen again. But nothing. Dejected, I turned around and walked back inside. The clock on the cabinet showed  12:30am  WHAT??  I had just went to close the blinds at 9:30pm !!  Where did 3 hours go ??!!! As stated, the above activity was in a frantic state to try and not miss the event. It was in no way near a 3 hour event. I tried to pad the events' time by judging maybe I spent more time on Google searching Orion / Sirius. Even if I did that for 1/2 an hour ( which I believe to be grossly incorrect) and if I stood on the patio for 1/2 hour in frustration, I'm still missing a couple of hours of time. I was tired, angry, frantic.  I didn't know what do next. I paced around my home for 3 hours trying to calm down. Finally I gave up around 4am, and went to bed.  I don't know why this event made me so frantic and upset. It is now 4 days later, and I can't get it out of my system. I told family and a friend about it, and they gave me the typical sympathetic look like I've come unglued. Posting this on the website to share. I have no answers. Only more questions.",2016-12-05T00:00:00,43.92118697674418,-78.86515720930232

Looking eastward over the lake/reservoir at Progress Ridge near the Beaverton/Tigard border, two male adult friends and I observed in the distance three radio towers situated in the West Hills that separate downtown Portland from its Western suburbs.  It is important to note that the cloud cover was low, but not low enough to obscure any portion of the radio towers in the distance.  I'll take this opportunity to say I don't believe what we saw was fireworks exploding within the clouds. In the clouds that appeared to be over the West hills and said radio towers we observed first a massive green light that rotated counter-clockwise.  It was orientated as though it was parallel to the ground, and made perhaps only a 90 degree rotation until it disappeared but was replaced (within one second or so) by the exact same shape, only this time in an incredibly quick burst of yellow, then orange, then red colors acting in the same manner. Some 20 seconds later, the exact same reen shape and light occurred again, rotating in the same direction and for roughly the same short amount of time, perhaps a few tenths of a second shorter. Next, only the yellow-colored shape appeared, not the red nor the orange. The object certainly appeared to be concealed precisely within the clouds that were illuminated by the city lights of downtown Portland, but they were absolutely distinct from those city lights. It reminded me of the handheld game ""Simon Says"" the way the colors changed from one to another, and the nature of the colors was reminiscent of the the taillight of a car, as if there was a membrane containing an inner light-producing object. There were also a larger number of aircrafts in that apparent area of the sky just before the lights occurred. Perhaps this could be explained by the vicinity of PDX airport, but the aircraft seemed to remain in the affected area for a far longer time than one would expect of any aircraft approaching the airport.  They also seemed to be physically closer to one another than is seemingly typical for civilian aircrafts.  I am no expert in aviation by any means, but it seemed as if they were flying in formation, sort of like you'd see whenever those F16 (or various fighter jets) fly overhead every so often (they didn't sound like fighter jets, I might add.)  The object appeared to be massive, but seemed to be deliberately concealed by the cloud cover of the late evening. Finally, I believe it is important to note that my two friends and I instantaneously grabbed one another by the sleeves of our jackets and stepped backwards, and all of us admitted to immediately feeling a sense of fear and dread, like you sometimes experience when in the woods and you feel like an animal or another person is nearby but you can't see them.  (I don't say this for dramatic effect, and I don't want to appear sensationalist, I just think it's important to note the immediate sensory reactions we experienced when we saw these lights.)  They did not return after their second episodic light show, but the cloud cover over downtown Portland did seem noticeably brighter than before.",2016-12-05T00:00:00,45.4835597,-122.8374352

At around 10 minutes past midnight on 11/24/16, I left Diberville, MS Wal-Mart and was in the process of loading my groceries into my car, when one of the shopping cart retrievers said loudly:  ""Will you look at that?  What is that?""  I immediately looked his way, which was to the north of the parking lot, and along with five other Wal-Mart employees (and maybe dozens of others we couldn't see in the area) were staring at what was at first glance, two stationary (hovering in-place) red, blinking lights.  Almost instantaneously, two others popped out of what appeared to be nowhere, in equidistant proximity to the first two. What was instantly apparent to me was the nature of the sighting, these lights weren't an airplane or any known aircraft that I could identify due to the nature of the lights.  They were silent, no apparent noise, they were stationary, as they didn't have a specific trajectory or path in any direction.  Also, the fact that they seemed to be blinking in unison and were hovering silently discounted the possibility of being any known aircraft.  We have an air-force base close by (Keesler AFB in Biloxi, ~ 6 miles from the sighting) from which land and take-off many C130 Air Force planes (Keesler is a home of the Hurricane Hunters).  Now, I've seen many a C130 land and take off at night, and the sighting pattern of what we seen last night was as different from a C130's profile as different could be. Then, almost as suddenly as these lights appeared, in twos, they disappeared completely from sight, in twos (there were four visible to us).  The whole incident lasted maybe 40 seconds to 1 minute.  Within 10 second of the UFO lights disappearing, the car alarms on four cars in the parking lot began to chime in unison, as if some kind of invisible beam and/or electromagnetic wave pulse triggered them.  One of the Wal-Mart employees then said in a spooked voice:  ""Something strange is goin' on here!""  I agreed!",2016-12-05T00:00:00,30.4438,-88.9008

First let me start by saying that where we live is very rural.  The State forest is my front yard.  Not many homes and very little traffic.  There used to be a landfill but has since closed.  My brother and I were driving to the store for our mother to get a few items.  My brother was driving the car.  Heading to the west going over the top of the hill to the north we both noticed something hovering above the trees, at first it looked like a helicopter with a weird orangish with a hint of light greenish tinted spot light all lit up and blinding almost like a giant star but it didn't have any sound and it was hovering just above the trees.  The best way to describe it would to say that it look ed like an orange/green street light in the distance, but VERY bright and VERY big, too bright to make out what it looked like without the lights.  It stayed perfectly still and soundless until we got about 30 feet away from the trees where it was hovering.  When we got closer it shot off to the north east at record speed.  The object flew out further into the wooded area and disappeared.  The weirdest part about it was that it shot out sparks similar to a comets tail when it took off. My brother decided to try to chase it through the woods. On a trail going 40 to 50 miles an hour trying to catch this object it was impossible. I am very familiar with airplanes and helicopters and this was neither. I have never seen an object take off that fast with trailing sparks.

I've texted this twice to George Noorey but have never received a reply. I worked for a year in Bunkerville, NV, on a large home remodeling project on a 10,000 sq. ft. ranch home from July of 2008 to July of 2009.  I stayed on the ranch which was just off of Gold Butte Rd. along the Virgin River about 90 min N of Las Vegas, 15 min S of Mesquite and 7 or so minutes S of the town center of Bunkerville.  Years later, after the skirmish at the Cliven Bundy ranch, I realized that where we had worked was right next to the Bundy ranch. The little guest house I stayed in while there was up on plateau accross the driveway from the main estate house and about 40 yards from the edge of a little cliff that went down to a dirt road.  The Virgin River was across a pasture on the other side of the road. The sound of heavy helicopters flying low and dark along the river in the wee hours was a regular occurance. One morning maybe sometime between 3 and 4 am, awakened by that sound, I went out, looked up and saw a meteor shower, so I lay down in the driveway and started watching. There were so many visible stars it was crazy. Here's shay happened next.  As I was looking up, the stars started disappearing in a straight line on the south horizon.  ALL the stars!  The dark line moved  north and eventually, the entire sky was dark.  Not a star to be seen.  Then after a few minutes, the sky started to show again in a strait line moving north. I believe that a silent object as large as the east is from the west, passed overhead blocking my view of the stars as it moved across the sky from horizon to horizon in all 4 directions. I didn't tell anyone except my wife for several years, but I've heard you on Coast to Coast several times and wondered what you might think of this?

The lights started low in the western sky, over the south side of Pueblo, moved at a steady speed and after about 2 to 3 min, pos. more, were almost directly over the hospital slightly to the south.  (Hospital entrance faces south).  I have seen several flares, hand held fired, artillery fired and dropped from aircraft,  Also these lights did not emit light like flares do.

We entered the building and did not see what happened to the lights.

This UFO sighting is very significant for many reasons.  First, the reliability of the witnesses are beyond reproach.  Second, the photographic evidence shows a very strange object, and if one looks carefully, two of the photos appear to show the silhouette of at least one occupant, possibly two. Statements by witnesses are forthcoming. Report of Sighting:  On Saturday, September 10, 2016, Pepe (fictitious name), wife, 22 yoa daughter, and 15 yoa son were in the process of exiting their house to enter their vehicle.  Son alerted Pepe about a bright light hovering above near the zenith.  Pepe saw the light and remarked it was not only too high over the horizon to be the planet Venus, but also brighter.  The object was stationary and to Pepe’s eyes it seemed to consist of two lights in one.  Pepe asked wife to bring camera from the house and asked her to take a photo of the light.  Wife took the first photo.  Camera is an old Sony digital camera, model DSC-HX200V, with an integrated zoom lens made by Carl Zeiss.  Wife handed over the camera to Pepe. Pepe took a photo.  He waited a few minutes and when he tried to take another photo could not locate the object in the LCD screen.  His son advised the object was still in the same place and after re-acquiring the object he took another photo.  Pepe advised the three photos had different zoom settings. After approximately 7-10 minutes a large cloud hid the object.  After realizing it would take a long time for the cloud to pass they decided to enter vehicle and departed area.  From time to time Pepe pulled over the vehicle in order to try to locate object, but the cloud was still hiding the object.  When the cloud finally moved away the object was gone. Pepe regrets he did not try to take more photos of the object at different zoom settings.  He thought at the time the object lacked any features and was not doing anything.  His overall impression of the experience is that whoever controlled this object wanted for him not just to see it, but to take photos of it. Date of Sighting: 10 Sep16  Geographical Location of Sighting:  San Juan, Puerto Rico Description of Area/ Surroundings:  Urban  Time of Sighting:  Shortly after 6:20 P.M. Weather Conditions: Clear Circumstances for Becoming Aware of Object: Son alerted his father (Pepe) Number of Objects:  One Apparent Size of Object at Arm’s Length (Subtended Angle): Similar to planet Venus Approximate Angle of Object from Horizon:  Approximately 80 deg.; Cardinal Orientation if Other Than Zenith (right above head):  West Estimated Distance to Object:  Several thousand feet Estimated Altitude of Object from Ground:  Several thousand feet Color of Object: White light. Appeared as two lights close together. Shape of Object:  Rounded Apparent Solidity of Object (Translucent or Solid): Solid Opaque or Bright: Bright Brightness of Object if Applicable:  Brighter than planet Venus Lights Observed on the Object:  The object seemed to glow. No additional lights observed. Lights Observed Coming from the Object (beams):  None Any Sound Detected: None Any Observed Rotation of Object: None with the naked eye.  Only by looking at the photos. Observed Behavior of Object:  Stationary Duration of Sighting:  Approximately 7-10 minutes Circumstances for Losing Sight of Object: Cloud Number of Witnesses (Adults/Minors):  Four (three adults, one minor) Photo or Video Recording Attempted:  Yes. Three digital photos taken. If Photo/Video Obtained, Provide Brand and Model: Sony DSC-HX200V Personal/Subjective Impression of this Sighting by the Witness(es): Pepe felt the object was posing for him Other Sightings in the Past by the Witness(es)? (Yes or No): Yes, all four If Yes, Determine Approximate Number and Frequency: A lot and very often Does/Do the Witness(es) Wish to Remain Anonymous?: Yes, at least for now. Photo Analysis: A detailed photo analysis is currently being conducted by one of the foremost experts in the world. Results of same will be released at a later date. Authentication of Photos:  Principal investigator have personally known Pepe and his family for many years and he can, absolutely and categorically, vouch for the reputation and trustworthiness of witnesses. Evaluation of Photographic Evidence by Principal Investigator: Maximum optical zoom: 30X Maximum combined optical and digital zoom: 120X EXIF data recorded by the camera for the Focal Length is regrettably incorrect. The camera records all photos as 144 mm of focal length. Pepe advised his camera is old and meant for amateur photography. He has a friend who owns the same model camera and it also records all photos as 144 mm. Photo #1:  Photo taken by wife.  EXIF data shows a Digital Zoom Ratio (DZR) of 3X, meaning the camera magnified the optical zoom by three times, for a total zoom setting of 90X.  Wife advised she used a zoom setting a bit lower than the maximum allowed by the camera.  Object appears as a somewhat flattened and very bright balloon, with a dark and thick horizontal band in the middle.  Also visible is a little bright ball underneath the object.  On the left side of the object one can appreciate at least three well delineated horizontal dark lines. Unable to determine whether these lines are painted or they are part of the infrastructure of the object. Photo #2: Photo taken by Pepe. DZR = 4X.  This is indeed the maximum zoom capability of the camera, providing a combined optical and digital zoom of 120X.  Pepe advised he used the maximum zoom setting.  One can observe two large semicircular apertures, or cavities, or windows in the underside of the object.  The inside of these two apertures are bathed with a very intense white light.  Of particular interest is the aperture at the 4 o’clock position, which appears to show two opaque figures silhouetted against the bright background.  The figure on the right side appears very humanoid in shape and slightly leaning to the left.  Some parallel dark lines are visible at the edges of the dark thick band. Photo #3:  Photo taken by Pepe.  DZR = 1.25X.  The combined optical and digital zoom was 37.50X.  Pepe advised he used just a bit of the digital zoom. In the third photo there is no light coming from the inside of the object, thereby revealing many features.  This is consistent with Pepe’s statement that he had a hard time trying to reacquire the object in the LCD screen of his camera.  This photo gives the impression the object rotated approximately 180° along its vertical axis.  (Bear in mind the object is not in the zenith (directly above), even though the photos give the impression Pepe was directly under the object.  The three photos were taken with the camera always facing the object from the same angle, meaning towards the West.)  The aperture with the two figures previously located at the 4 o’clock position now seems located at the 11 o’clock position.  The apparent humanoid figure that was leaning to the left in photo #2 is now more clearly visible through it.  What is more, this figure seems to be resting its arms on the border of the semicircular aperture.  To the right of this figure there appears to be another humanoid figure.  In photo #3 one can clearly see the closely-spaced dark lines are not painted, but are ridges or striations running parallel and towards the center of the object.",2016-10-11T00:00:00,,

It traveled in silently in a straight line, making steady progress but not in any particular hurry.  Then it stopped and just hovered.  I called to my husband to come out. It was still broad daylight at this time and the sky was clear. As the object hovered there, it appeared to be bouncing or pulsing.  It seemed to periodically flash a reflective silver appearance, like it was flipping over or something.  It was hard to tell if the shape was actually circular or spherical – or more elongated, although when I first saw it, it appeared as a circle. It was very far up, it seemed, I don’t know how to judge the distance but it appeared higher than most planes that we usually see in that area.  It was so high that pictures my husband tried to take with his really good camera don’t really show anything other than a long, more cigar-shaped flash of light, which is not how it looked to our naked eyes.  As it hovered, there were times when it seemed to disappear, then reappear.  It hung for several minutes, then moved upward and out of sight. It feels like our ability to truly perceive even the basics, such as the shape, distance and behavior, of this object was limited.",2016-10-11T00:00:00,,

The fireball moved in every direction.  To the right, left, and up and down in which a contrail of fire or plasma followed it.  It didn't move very fast. everytime it changed direction, it seemed to have its own power source in which it flared up on its own.  It did this for at least 5 to 10 minutes.  It remained still for a short period of time until two small dots came out from behind the fireball, each one on opposite sides, and they floated around.  after that i was puzzled and left......about one week later, i saw the same orange ball sitting on the horizon further east somewhere above the state line of Maine in which route 25 continues into.   The only other witness to this second event, was a friend of mine who also saw the object on the horizon that same week. the object didn't move it remained stationary and you could see it during the daylight.

During early May 2016, my family took a road trip involving visits to CA, AZ, NV and NM.  Of course, we wanted to visit Roswell and Socorro, NM, and we did.  Prior to our departure, I watched my documentaries and videos regarding the Lonnie Zamora UFO incident on April 24, 1964.  I was really fascinated with this case because Lonnie Zamora was a sworn police officer at the time of the incident which I believe makes his testimony and credibility noteworthy. A recent documentary video in particular caught my attention.  2 researchers who were working with Ray Sanford (I believe he arrived on scene April 29, 1964, and was able to perform an investigation with the assistance of Dr. James Allen Hynek) gave a presentation regarding up to date information obtained through continued research into this incident. In particular, was a claim that approximately 1 year after the incident, both Ray Stanford and Dr. Hynek returned to the landing site.  I believe I have seen a few pictures online confirming the same.  It is alleged that Ray Stanford took random snap shots of the area and many, many, years later discovered objects flying in the air  off in the distance.  It is my understanding Ray Stanford, at a later time when appropriate, may share those pictures with the public. While visiting the landing site which has been marked with rocks and a mural memorial to Lonnie Zamora, I decided to take some radiation readings and random photographs of the area. Nothing jumped out during the radiation testing but upon later examination we did discover an object in our photos that was not seen with the naked eye.  To confirm there was something in the air, I did use MUFON's free to the public image analysis tools.  While I am no expert, it does appear to verify we caught something in our photos.  The object appears to be metallic, grey colored and oval/round. In addition, prior to driving to Socorro we visited a Native American petroglyph site approximately 1 hour north.  We took many pictures of the drawings on the rocks.  After we discovered the object in our Socorro photos, we decided to more closely examine our petroglyph photos too.  It was then we discovered in 1 of the photos an object high in the sky that was not visible with the naked eye.  This object appears more oval/elliptical. We are not saying what we caught on our photographs is extraterrestrial in nature.  It could very well be a plane, bird, some sort of flying debris, etc.  However, it is worth noting that at no time did we hear any noise or observe any jet contrails in the sky.  These photos and videos were all taken with a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 mobile phone.  So we were surprised that we captured something with the limited capabilities of a mobile phone vs. a real camera or camcorder. I hope one day Lonnie Zamora's name is fully cleared and any doubt about his testimony will be put to rest.  RIP Lonnie!  If NUFORC would like copies of my digital photos and videos, I'd be more than happy to share them.",2016-11-11T00:00:00,33.8974,-107.02609999999999

It was a beautiful day and we stopped at several overlooks to take pictures.  Later that day we also drove through Cades Cove which is also in the park and we continued to take pictures of the mountains.  Later, while viewing the pictures, we noticed an anomaly in two pictures from two different locations.  The pictures were clear but the anomalies were oddly fuzzy and without defined edges and a bit different from each other.  If it was just in one picture I would not think too much about it, but we were in two different locations taking pics of the same mountains from two different vantage points.

Me and the other witness were going out to smoke some cigarettes and everything was muffled under the first snowfall of the year.  After a few smokes we began to hear these bizarre, high-pitched noises.  I mean, the noises we were hearing were otherworldly.  Witness 2 is a bird-watcher and says there is nothing like that in nature (not to mention our nature is pretty limited in this town).  If I could compare the noise to anything it would be a zipline made of electricity.  There were two of the same noises, each which lasted about half a second yet created a distinct Doppler effect.  When me and my friend slowly went outside to see what the hell was going on there were birds flying from the direction of the noise (in a dead, snowy night) we could tell that the noises were almost communicating with each other.  Then all of a sudden the noises came again and the most ridiculous thing in my life.  At the moment they made the final noise there was this streak of electricity moving faster than I've seen anything move yet trailing a tail of what in the brief time I could see it appeared to be electricity.  So naturally at first I attributed it to something hitting a telephone wire or something.  But when I walked further out to get a view I realized there never was and never has been a telephone pole in that direction for a long ways.  The closest one is strung along the opposite direction.  I have not believed in anything UFO related up until this point, but this is the second encounter I've had this week. I'm actually wary of publicizing it on here but I will include it in another report since it was almost a week prior from this and the 2nd witness involved was not present.",2016-12-05T00:00:00,39.07603153409091,-108.54615767045453

Background was clear deep blue with many almost still standard clouds clearly visible.  I was located directly under the east end of the horizontal movement, where the strange clouds were each more or less stationery for a couple of seconds with each pass.  I think this was probably the best location to view. The moving clouds were almost the same white colour as the standard clouds, but with a slightly grainy texture, and slightly whiter.  At no time could I see though the two strange clouds to the clear deep blue background.  Viewed for about 20 minutes, and then viewed again about an hour later with same observations except that the blue background was darker.  Assumed that the repeated movement had continued for this hour duration.

It travelled south slowly away from my position but the appendages similar to bi-plane wings or solar panels had changed and appeared to be on the west or right side of the object.

After a few seconds the object changed course to due south as it approached where I was standing.  It travelled south slowly away from my position, but the appendages similar to bi-plane wings or solar panels had changed and appeared to be on the west or right side of the object. I called my daughter out to see the object.  Her first reaction was “it’s a plane”.  I sort of disputed that by saying “where’s the wings”.  She said “well it doesn’t seem to have any”.  At that point the object was cigar shaped with appendages on its right side.  We watched it continue south and I looked away to come inside the house and my daughter said it disappeared.  I looked one last time and didn’t see it. Summarizing:  the object had physical shape, brilliantly reflected the setting sun producing a gleaming effect, made no noise, had no blinking lights, traveled in very steady manner, changed direction and shape.",2016-10-11T00:00:00,33.96188745901639,-84.51021319672131

I couldn't see a shape, just a singular bright white light.  I thought, well maybe it's a heliocopter with a spotlight, but I've seen that before, & this was different.  Also no sounds that you'd hear from a low flying craft. The light initially traveled from south to north, then made an abrupt 90 degree turn that initially looked like it was going east.  The light then faded to look similar to a bright star or planet.  It continued to fade and look like a dim star.  Then it was no longer visible.

This was the evening of September 30, 2016, approximately 7:30 pm in the backyard of a co-workers home there were about 15-20 persons in attendance, when someone asked what is that?  I looked up to see what was a red light illuminating to a bright white light growing in intensity and size to 1/4 of the moon, but not directed at the ground just in a straight forward direction.  There was no visible shape or size of the object, again it was dark outside.  It was moving from a northerly direction, to the south towards us at a fairly rapid rate coming from the Pacific ocean inland.  It seemed to be approximately 1200 to 1500 feet in altitude.  The object all of a sudden the object stopped on a dime in mid-flight and became static (hovering).  There were no navigation lights (the usual red or white flashing lights).  The craft never turned or rotated to where the bright light could be seen turning direction.  After staying static for approximately 5-8 minutes, it then began to go in reverse at the same speed and identical flight path just like it had come into view (back over the Pacific ocean).  After about a minute and a half the bright white light turned off and changed to dim red color and slowly faded as it moved further away over the ocean. This flight exhibition was performed 3 separate times at about 10 minute intervals in between appearances that evening and witnessed by all in attendance in that backyard that evening.  Same flight path, same white lighted pattern-faded to red over the ocean return flight, same no sound performance. Waiting to hear either blade or propeller wash sound or jet engine sounds, this craft made not one sound, ""ABSOLUTELY"" nothing.  Either during approach-return flight pattern or while it was static.  I've been around alot of aircraft in my lifetime, my grandfather being a pilot since the 1930's and working on alot of military air bases, I have never experience anything flying that does not make any sound at that close of  elevation to the ground. We happen to be close to a couple of municipal airports and Point Mugu, a naval station which is 3-4 miles away.  We are accustomed to seeing military, small personal aircraft and helicopters quit often.  This was in no way a military, civilian or helicopter aircraft. I can truly say I feel I have seen my first UFO sighting.  I wanted to see if anyone else had experience the same occurrence that evening.  I also have a small cell phone video clip which I took and will be submitting with this report.",2016-10-11T00:00:00,34.19450050251256,-119.16316080402011

Situation occurred 11 years ago. Around noon, at the end of the summer I was chatting with my friend using icq messenger.  I do not remember exactly why, but i stood up and went to the window of my room and looked outside. My apartment was at fourth floor of an apartment block with another house directly opposite to it.  Portion of the blue sky is clearly visible there with no trees or power lines obstructing the view. I saw a glint in the sky in my peripheral vision, and looked up.  Almost directly above me there were two shapes “orbiting” one another with significant distance.  I focused my attention on one of them that was easier to see.  It had a shape of a water droplet sitting on a glass.  Round if you look from the bellow, and oval squished on the bottom if you look from a side. It’s material resembled mercury.  Perfect mirror without any dirt or scratches.  There was something that looked like ripples going through it’s “surface”  As if it’s not a solid object.  Ripples did not correspond with any outside interference that i could see. Object had subtle purple haze or glow on its sides that was not constant.  I remember that at one moment I could see it, at another - not. Approximately half a minute into observation, a dark spot approximately one eighth the surface of the object appeared on its side and started spinning around the edge without any pattern with different speed and direction.  It had blurred edges and was absolutely black without any lights or reflections.  At the time I thought that it “sucked in” the light.  It appeared for 5-10 seconds, then disappeared and appeared again. I switched my attention to the other object, it looked exactly the same, but was harder to see as it was almost directly above my apartment block.  I had to move myself halfway outside of the window and look up to see it, which was dangerous for me. Both objects were below the cloud layer, as remember seeing small white cloud above the object that was easier to observe.  I could not figure out the exact distance to the object or object size because there were no clear frame of reference.  I can only guess that distance may have been from 500m to 1km.  Both objects did not look massive.  If I take a guess - around 20 meters in diameter. They moved in formation, “orbiting” one each other, slowly moving, progressing to the south-west. After approximately two minutes of observation, first object started disappearing as if it was losing opacity becoming completely transparent in about 10-15 seconds.  Second object did the same shortly afterwards. I looked at the sky for some time afterwards, however there was nothing more to notice. As a disclaimer:  I have no record of hallucinations, drug/alcohol abuse or diagnosed mental illness.  And I’m not claiming this event as “alien” encounter.  However I can not explain this event with any natural event or technology known to me.

They were no brighter than the surrounding stars.  They moved from the west going east (75 degrees WNW according to my cell-phone compass). They were directly overhead and appeared to us to be at an altitude of in-flight commercial aircrafts.  They traveled as fast as commercial planes at cruising altitude. There was no sound and they traveled in a straight path.  There was some position changing within the formation.  According to weather.gov, the wind was calm at 18:53 and 5 mph from the SW at 19:53.  Our observation was at 19:10. We did not feel or observe any wind. At first sight, I was alone. I saw 10 white lights (round) in a staggered row from left to right with 5 trailing in a 2-1-2 pattern.  I went to get my wife so she could see/confirm.  This took 15-20 seconds.

I normally would not have bothered to submit this 51 year old report, except for the astounding similarity of the object that I observed, to that seen by the young woman in Huntington Beach, California, on December 04, 2016. Report details:  I was in my bedroom at our parents’ house in Teaneck, New Jersey, on the evening of August 1, 1965, listening to WINS 1010 out of New York – a 24 hour news station at the time.  About 9:15 PM, in the evening, the news anchor announced that formations of UFOs were being sighted over the Four Corners region of the American Southwest at that very moment. Being interested in UFOs at the time I grabbed my father’s 10 by 50 binoculars, and raced out to the front lawn.   I lay down in the middle of the lawn and began watching the sky.  After seeing nothing for about 10 minutes I aimed the binoculars at Vega, which was just about at the zenith.  With my arms tiring, I began to lift the binoculars away from my face, when suddenly in my peripheral vision I saw something orange in color appear from the roofline of my parents’ house.  It was moving very quickly, but as the binoculars were still close to my face I was able to train them on this peculiar object, and follow its trajectory until it disappeared over pine trees in our yard. What I saw was a chevron shaped object, virtually identical in shape to the object drawn in the Huntington Beach report.  Overall, the object glowed a dull orange, with the exception of a perfectly circular area that was as dark as the surrounding sky in the left ‘wing’ of the object.  This circular area took up exactly the same amount of space as each of the luminous grey circles depicted in the Huntington Beach report. I was impressed by the rectilinear shape of this object, all the sides being perfectly straight, and the sharp angles, just as in the Huntington Beach object’s drawing.  It was in view for about one and one half seconds.  It took up about 1/6th of the binocular’s field of view width.",,40.8889,-74.0119

I have extensive military and aviation experience, this was not an aircraft.  It moved directly overhead from on shore at approx 20 miles per hour.  As it's approx 20 miles between Groton and L.I., I observed the craft for nearly 1 hr, before losing it over the horizon.  It was totally silent.  It blocked out about 1/3rd of the sky.  If my estimate of its height was wrong and it was higher in altitude, then it would be even larger.  I could not make out any details of its design or construction, other than its shape. This may conform to an FAA reported radar target observed over Groton on 9/11.  Unfortunately although there is a regional airport at Groton, with approach radar, their tower is not manned after 9pm.  This craft may have been only 2 miles from the airport at closest approach.  I am attempting to coordinate this sighting with radar data from Providence, RI, and Bradbury, CT, as well as USCG records from the RD&C during the imaging test.   At the time this occurred I was too shaken up and afraid to follow up. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The aircraft was approximately 200 yards from rear corner to rear corner.  There were white lights on each corner, a total of three lights.  There were no other lights visible.   The aircraft was so large and so low it felt like we could have thrown a rock and hit it.  There was absolutely no sound emitting from the craft.

I've witnessed multiple orb-like sightings over the past few years, in the Fort Nelson area. They are as follows:  I can't remember the exact year of the first one, because I was just a kid, but it was somewhere between 2000-2003.  It was winter and I was playing outside with my friends in the evening, it was dark out with a clear sky.  I saw what looked like a star or planet in the sky suddenly get very bright and orange, it looked like a fireball of sorts.  Within half a second or so it faded, and there was nothing at all there anymore.  I didn't really think anything of it, other than ""wow that was cool!"", and I wondered why the original star disappeared. I saw the same thing again in 2011, only with white light instead of orange this time, and later at night in mid-to-late summer.  I told one of my friends who was with me, that I had just seen a star get really bright then totally disappear.  She hadn't seen it though, and she just said I was seeing things.  At that point, I wondered if what I had witnessed were supernovas, but after doing research on supernovas, I realized that was highly unlikely.. My third sighting was in early summer, 2015.  It was late at night, and I was laying in bed looking out the window of my basement level apartment, just looking at the sky trying to fall asleep.  All of a sudden this bright red glowing dot (larger than a satellite, and much brighter) came into view from the edge of my window.  I jumped up, now very much awake, and went to the window to get a better look.  This glowing dot/orb was a steady light, not pulsating.  It was traveling in the sky from the north of town, and looked like it was going on a slightly curved path through the sky right over town.  It was pretty high up from what I could tell. I watched this light for about 1.5 seconds, when suddenly a second red light appeared some distance behind the first.  They both moved in a straight line briefly, then the first light got very bright, and looked as though it was descending towards town, in my direction in fact. I'm not one to scare easily but I suddenly felt very uneasy like I was being watched.  The second light faded into black sky and disappeared.  The first light continued to get slowly bright and lower, as though it was getting closer to my street.  The feeling that it was watching me suddenly very strong, that's when I started to feel scared instead of just uneasy.  I ducked down beneath my window out of sight. By the time I was brave enough to look out again it was gone. I should add that both of these lights were moving very slowly and steadily like they had a purpose, no zipping around quickly.  The whole thing lasted less than a minute I believe. The most recent sighting I had was in the fall of 2015.  I was stargazing with some friend on a hill just outside of town, when I saw another bright orb-shaped light, this time white.  This time there were multiple people who saw it.  Again it was coming towards town from the north, moving steadily and with a constant light, not pulsating.  We watched it for a good 30 seconds or more, and could tell it was flying much lower than any satellite (I should mention there was an avid stargazer with us, who knows their stuff very well.  He agreed it was not a satellite but didn't know what it might be).  From where we were we could see most of town, and when it got to just outside of town it faded and disappeared. These all took place in or very near the town of Fort Nelson. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was a little bored after sitting there for several hours and not seeing any movement on the ground, I was being entertained by a flock of about thirty Canadian geese flying overhead in a south westerly direction.  After they had passed by, I continued to look toward the sky when I saw as clear as day, a glassy like cigar shaped object traveling west to east directly overhead.  There was no sound or exhaust trails behind it.   The object was flying at a very high rate of speed and much higher than the airliners that regularly fly by.

Mr. Davenport was on Coast to Coast AM last night and prompted me to share an experience I had during the last two weeks of August 1957. I was a High School student at the time, working for the summer in a lighting factory.  I made note of several odd sightings, but was not eager to report it to anyone. Because stories like this were likely to not have been believed. Last night, George Noory interviewed Peter Davenport and the interview prompted me to report this. There were a series of events that I never connected until last night. About the 15th of August, I was interested in observing the sky in the hopes of seeing the newly built CF105 AVRO Arrow that was being tested out of Malton Airport, Ontario.  It was about noon when I noticed a large reflective disk directly above me at about half a Km.  It was the same color as the blue sky, with wisps of cloud exactly the same as the sky was 10 minutes previously.   I first thought it was a large weather balloon but it slowly disappeared as though it deflated or went straight up at great speed.  There was no sound.  In a few seconds, it re-appeared as though it descended at great speed to where it was originally.  The clouds rolled in and became invisible or camouflaged in wispy clouds. The following Wednesday evening I set out to drive from Toronto to Baltimore for a conference. I took a shortcut from Batavia NY on Hwy 14 through Pennsylvania. About 3am, I started seeing figures standing at the side of the road in the mist.I recognized them as greys later; when I heard someone describe a grey on a radio show. After the conference I headed north to Rochester with a couple of friends for company. I was driving on the New Jersey Turnpike about 2:30am and what seemed like a few seconds the sun was up and I was on a highway heading into Harrisburg.  My friends were sound asleep. after a few miles and highway signs I was back on route to Rochester.  It was very strange that I was not tired when we arrived in Rochester and spent ths rest of the day sight seeing then drove to Toronto. After a few hours sleep, I went to work at 7am, still not tired.  It seemed to be I might have been abducted and losing hours of time.

Right during sun down i was watching T.V.  I noticed a light that caught my attention in the sky.  It caught my attention because there was still light out in the sky and you could still make out the clouds. The light was a very bright white.  It seemed odd because it was not high in the sky from my point of view and because it was a very clear bright light and there were no other stars visible in the sky.  I sort of figured it was just a very bright star. I was facing South in the direction of the light. In front of my home there is a 3 story building across the street.  The light was in the distance but just above the horizon of the building from my point of view. I don't believe it was close at all since it just appeared like a very bright star in the sky at sundown. The light remained stationary, I asked the person next to me to look at the light.  They first thought it was a light from a building very far away since it was a very bright white light, sort of the type you would see on Tall building Radios. I told them that it was not because we don't have those types of tall buildings in our city. They then just said at it in confusion. There were no sounds of helicopters around and there were no other lights around it, something a helicopter might have. ( red and white )  It did not move and stayed in the same position.  After a few minutes, It suddenly began to dim. and then the light was gone just before the sun completely went down.  The Dim of the light lasted about 10 seconds before it completely went out. Could of it been a drone?  Why would a drone need such a powerful light when there was still light out? and Don't most LED lights go off suddenly?  rather than a 10 second fade away?  the light did not seem near, appeared to be very far away like a star.",2016-12-15T00:00:00,44.039544983277594,-123.12515735785954

And they were right the stars were gone something replaced the stars with what I could describe as perfectly squared knots and bolts connected to rods, like standing underneath a perfectly well made car covered the entire sky.  It was a duel black color and there was no lights and it didn't move it just sat there.

And this thing reached from where I was standing at 7th Ave passed Camelback Mountain!!  {Also we lived on a busy street and theirs was no cars, no people, and absolutely no noise. I mean no sound anywhere.  I can't explain it but its as if time stopped.}  Any way, this thing was huge and I yelled to my children who were strangely standing all the way by the door I said, ""Wow!  This thing reaches all the way to camelback mountain wow! And my oldest daughter at the time was 11 years old said, ""Well I'm going in the house"" as if she was frightened and that's not like her to act like that at all.  At that moment that's when I realized I was standing under a Huge Mothership!  So I didn't look up because I didn't want them who were in the Ship to know that I knew it was a Mothership.  So I attempted to make a run for the door when everything suddenly went Black.  I completely Blacked out and cannot remember how the hell I got in the house.

The first thing I said to myself was, “What in the hell is that?”  I was home alone at the time so no one else saw it, so I decided not to say anything about it.  Since then, I have only told my wife.  It has really bothered me every day since I saw it.

July 6th around 4pm, I was in the backyard manning the bbq.  During this time of day in Central Florida, the cumulus clouds build and bloom up into the sky.   So as I flipped burgers I also kept an eye to the sky to watch the building cloud activity.  I noticed a group of black crows flying about as high as I have ever seen them fly, so I was just watching the black crows riding the updrafts I caught sight of what I thought was a dark jet aircraft flying horizontally above the cloud tops.  However, the jet was not what I expected.  Once I started to get a good look at it I became confused.  It was a perfect sphere shape.  A metallic sheen like polished LEAD.  I could not see any wings, just a round sphere object moving like a jet aircraft, straight on a path, then it slowed to nearly a full stop and took an unexpected turn downward tracing the outline of the cloud as it descended thousands of feet. I was wearing my polarized prescription sun glasses, and again I could not see any indications of wings. There was no noise at all, not a whisper and I was well within distance to hear a prop engine or jet.  When this craft took the downward turn it was diving at a faster speed, then it actually slowed down at the bottom of its dive and took a reverse angle turn into the cloud.  A human pilot would have blacked out from that maneuver. Approximate time of viewing the flight path was about 10 to 15 sec.  I kept staring at the cloud for the eventual exit with the assumed normal flightpath of a normal aircraft, but it never made an exit from the cloud.  I gave up seeing it again and I took the hotdogs off the grill and promptly went into the house to tell the family what I saw and after lunch drew up a photo illustration.  I used a photo taken from the same spot of a cloud very similar to the one with this craft. It was a good reference because it had a jet airliner in the scene and I could relate all drawing elements to that.   Lately, I used my skills as an animator to re-enact the scene as an animation.  The animation is very, very accurate to what I saw that day.  The animation plays several times allowing you to see it again and again.   Note:  I was a Security Police in the USAF and I am very familiar with all types of military aircraft.  This craft was not anything familiar.

I am not really sure of the date of this occurrence, but I know it was in the fall of last year.  I am very sure of the time though as it occurred when I got home from work, which is usually just before 5:30 am.  I have a habit of doing some star gazing when I get home and on this night it was particularly clear. I was facing more of less due east and was looking almost straight up, maybe 80 degrees of incline, when I observed two white fuzzy, extremely faint ""worm looking things"" plodding along next to each other in a northerly direction.  It appeared one of the ""worms"" was slinking along in a steady fashion while the other was doing more of a zigzag pattern and flying around the other.  It would remind you of a mother dolphin cruising with a baby dolphin swimming around her. Not really sure of what I was seeing, and thinking I my eyes were playing tricks on me, I looked to a different part of the sky for a couple seconds.  I thought I'd see the ""worms"" there because I was pretty sure it was one of those instances where you see something moving, but it's just a ""floater""(as my optometrist calls them) that is inside your eyeball.  Not seeing anything in the patch of sky I was looking at I looked back to where I had seen the ""worms"" and sure enough I saw them still going in their northerly direction. I did one more check by looking to another part of the sky and then back at the ""worms"" and had the same result.  Still very perplexed I watched the objects continue northbound until I could no longer see them.  In all I probably observed the objects for 2-3 minutes and they covered about a 35 degree traverse of the sky.  As I said before they were extremely faint and appeared to be at a very, very high altitude.  As for a size, the best way I can think of to put a scale to it would be to use the diameters of the stars.  They appeared to both be about 5 star diameters long and 1 wide.  I've seen plenty of satellites in the night sky and I can definitely say the ""worms"" were going much slower. I've only ever told my brother about this.  Being that I'm a police officer it's not exactly something I'm going to share with my coworkers and friends.  The closest thing I've seen resembling these objects are in some of the ""space serpents"" or ""space worms"" videos online.  However, what I saw was not merely drifting but appeared to be propelled(albeit very slowly) and guided in some way, but they did not appear to be a craft or ship of any sort.  Even though I still do some star gazing when I get home I have yet to see my serpent friends again.  If I do I will report it in a more timely fashion.

Where this sighting occurred, I-39 is actually going in an East-West direction.  There was no precipitation and relatively clear sky.  The sun would soon be setting at about the 9 o’clock position to my car.  The distant trees and buildings on the south side of the road in this location would block the sun from coming into my car. I noticed at about the 11 o’clock position, there was an intensely bright white round-shaped object about 600’ away and moving relatively slow in an easterly direction about 25’ above the ground. When I noticed it, it appeared to be about 20” in diameter and just beyond the south side of the road. It then dipped down, then up to about 40’ above the ground, greatly picking up speed as it then curved to the North/NE and passed over the ‘south-bound’ lanes.  As it moved over the approximately 50’ of median plus road shoulders it dipped downward coming directly towards my car and hitting the middle of my windshield, glancing off, and continuing NE in a straight line.  As it hit it made a very loud, heavy ‘dunk’ sound followed by a ‘clink’.  From my right side window, I saw it go straight to the NE and then was out of my sight.  At the moment of impact, from the loud sound I had braced for the windshield to break apart or at the very least be cracked.  To my amazement it didn’t break ! apart.  I continued approximately two miles to my destination and examined the windshield.  I could not find a single trace of anything on it: no breakage, cracks, or smudges of any type. When I first saw the object, I thought it was a large bird.  However, as I continued to watch it as it crossed the south-bound lanes and get closer, it appeared to diminish to about 6” in diameter with what appeared to be a heavy 6” tail like that of a comet’s dust tail by the time it hit my car.  I don’t know if it actually had a heavy ‘dust trail’ or if that was my brain trying to track its movement.  I do know that with it coming within 24” of my face there were no wings, feathers, beak, eyes, feet, or anything remotely resembling a bird or of any other color:  Just a very intense white ball-shape.  In addition, when fowl or animals hit a vehicle, they usually hit with a ‘thud’ sound due to the compression of soft tissue.  And a bird’s beak usually hits before or during impact, not afterward and usually has a different sound other than the ‘clink’ I heard.  Plus there will usually be some type of smudge or residue on the glass.  I was very puzzled by whatever it was that I saw and hit my windshield, but since there was no damage done,  I chalked it up to being ‘unknown’.  That changed October 22, 2016, with a similar sighting at night.  October report filed separately.",2016-11-04T00:00:00,44.54856202531645,-89.52476202531645

Around 7 pm on 11/29/2016, I saw a large airplane making a steep banked turn.  A few minutes later I saw what I thought was a smaller plane doing the same, only less banked.  What struck me as unusual was the steep angle of the banking and the low position to the ground. Approximately an hour later, I’m standing outside in Fairfield, CA, having a smoke when I saw what I thought was a boomerang-shaped flock of white birds flying east over Suisun Bay.  As they moved east, over Fairfield, it looked more like a giant scarf floating on the wind.  As I discounted the scarf theory, and wondered what it could be, it looked more like a giant dark bird flying in a V shape.  Only the size was too big to be any bird.  Some stars were visible and I could make out the ‘wing’ eclipse one of the stars.  As it traveled east, it blended into the dark sky. There were no lights or sounds coming from that direction, and the breeze was minimal.  I watched it glide by for over a minute.  At times it reminded me of a 30-foot piece of fabric floating in the air.  As it passed by (at a 40 degree angle from where I was standing), it was larger, darker, and more v-shaped … if it was closer I would have guessed it was a bird gliding by with wings in a ‘v’ shape.  But it was LARGE, and quiet.  There were no airplane noises or anything.  It continued east until I couldn’t see it for the darkness of the sky.  It did not appear to head towards Travis AFB to the south, but rather towards Vacaville to the east. Surely someone else saw it.  What was it?",2016-12-05T00:00:00,38.26628125,-122.04649967105263

But one evening, I noticed something very mysterious that has puzzled me ever since.  Here’s my report from whatever I can recollect. WHAT:  It was the usual star-like object (a bit on the fainter side; constant brightness; no flicker), almost directly overhead me, whose movement I could follow for about 5 seconds only, for it disappeared abruptly.  Distance the object traveled in this 5 sec. period was approximately equivalent to width of 3 fingers on outstretched arm.  Curiosity gripped me since it was a cloudless sky!  I kept scanning that area for another 30 seconds or so… and I was rewarded because it reappeared exactly at that very spot where it had disappeared - but was now moving in exactly the opposite direction and traversing its earlier path only to disappear again after 5 seconds at that very spot where it had appeared for the first time!!   I must have spent another good 15-20 minutes observing that region, but nothing more happened. In short:  First it moved from point A to point B and disappeared for some time; it appeared again at point B, traveled back to A and disappeared, thereafter.

All that day, Tuesday, I saw no floating debris, signs of marine life, or seaweed, until precisely 17:00 hours (5:00 p.m., ship's time). 				 At first to the left of my perspective (I was looking due south), I observed an object that resembled the top of a post standing above the surface of the ocean, within thirty-five to forty feet out from the starboard side of our vessel.  It stood three to four feet high, was approximately eighteen inches in diameter, seemed entirely round, with a tapering, rounded top; was uniformly featureless and dark in color, perhaps black; in shape, it somewhat resembled a human thumb.  Most remarkably, the object was absolutely rooted in place, completely unmoving, as those driven solidly into the seabed, about two thousand feet under the Eurodam 's keel.  The object was not afloat or bobbing with the waves, which instead broke around it, and never altered its unchanging position during the five or six seconds I kept it in view.  For a moment, I suspected that it may have been the periscope of a passing submarine, but almost instantaneously dismissed such an interpretation, because no sub commander would so gravely risk his vessel by taking it within forty feet of the Eurodam's extremely turbulent wake.  No other debris, etc. was observed on the surface of the sea the rest of that day.  I forwarded a written description of the Tuesday sighting to our Captain, explaining my concern that the object may have been a navigational hazard of some kind.

There were multiple lights but it was far enough away it looked like a point of light, couldn't quite make out a shape.  One white light was constantly on, the other (2 or more) lights were blinking colors.  I used a star light to base the movements.  It would hover for a few seconds then jerk in any direction and then hover again.  Reminded me of the seemingly random movements of an insect.  I took a 5 min video on my phone and stayed at least another 5 min holding my dog watching the event.  The object stayed in the same area of the sky (between two close trees) from my vantage, and moving away from me southbound slightly.  I am familiar with the movements of known aircraft including personal drones.  At first, I thought It was a drone, but the movements were inconsistent with a drone because there was no acceleration or deceleration, ! just movement and seemingly perfect hovering.  There is an airport in the area.  The clouds moved in during the sighting and the unknown light was below the cloud layer.  There was twice a smaller/distant light that blinked once near the object similar to a satellite.

So technically it was on September 10 at 1:00 am, but the night of the 9th, if that makes sense.  I didn't contact any residents because it seemed to descend over where the bay is, so very few people may have seen it since few houses overlook the bay.  I didn't contact the press because, without a photograph, I would just appear to be crazy.  I considered taking a photo but my phone camera has poor quality, especially in the nighttime, so the photo would just be an indiscernible blur since I was in a moving car.

A couple of weeks earlier, whilst watching the pictures that I took on my phone during my holiday, I noticed an odd shaped blue object sitting next to the One World Trade Center tower.  I first thought that it was just an optical effect due to the reflection of the sunlight on my camera lens.  Then I remembered that my girlfriend was also taking photos with her phone of the same tower at the same time. I took her phone and looked closely at her pictures and unsurprisingly, the same object is on 2 other photos taken with her phone.  However, it seems having a slightly different shape on the pictures that she took compared to mine. I'm not sure how long this object was sitting there for as we did not see it on the spot but it is likely to have appeared/disappeared very quickly.  We have several pi! ctures of the same tower but the object only appears on 3 of them.

It was at that point in the late day, when the sun is just starting to go down, so it was still very bright outside.  The sky was extremely clear, and there was not a  single cloud in sight anywhere to be seen. As I was driving South on Route 1 in Northeast Philadelphia, I was passing right at the area of Route 1 (Roosevelt Boulevard) and Oxford Avenue, and I was in the far  left lane of the middle lane. I just happened to look up at the sky in front of me and to the left, when I noticed what I right away assumed to be just a white cloud  stationary and not at all moving up in the sky. After passing Oxford avenue, I got stuck at the next traffic light.  I kept looking at the object and noticed that it was not moving at all, and that there were no  clouds anywhere in the entire sky.  As I kept staring at it, I thought it was a very starge looking cloud, and then very quickly realized it was not a cloud at all. When I realized this was not a bird, cloud, or an airplane or helicoptor, or any known aviation object I have ever seen before, I asked my passenger, ""Do you see that  up there?, What is that?""  He was amazed just like me and we sat in traffic for about 30-90 seconds just staring at it. It was not moving at all, niether were we.  That  is how we know it was not moving. I was driving, and because we both were staring in confusion at just what exactly we were looking at, it never occured to either one of us to get a photo of it with  our phones.  I'm not sure it would have turned out anyway. We started driving again, and I could see it starting to move downwards, or in the direction coming closer to  the ground.  But it was very, very high up in the sky, and it was oviously very big. In front of me and to the left there were high trees, and we both lost sight of the object for a few seconds, then we saw it again after passing the trees off the side  of the road.  We came to another traffic light and were stopped.  And then thats when we could see it more clearly, and we had the trees as an eye-sight-marker, as the  object was in back of the foreground trees in our sight. So once we were stopped we could clearly see the object more visible in detail and how it was movong and traveling using the tree as a marker. It kept moving downward in back of the trees, and as soon as we started driving again, when we got out in the open more where the sky was more open and visible, thats when we saw them. 3 more  of the same exact kind appeared out of nowhere to the left of the first object we saw. We dont know if they were already there and were just obscured by the trees or not, but I only saw the one at first, when the viewable sky was all open for my vision. And like I stated above, it initially was not moving and was actually closer.  The more we drove in it's direction (South) the further away it became.  It was oviously  movong very fast. There were a total of 4 objects in the sky, and they were all the exact same shape and white-brightness, still not known if it was the sun refecting off the object, making it so bright during that time of day, at least thats how I percieved what I was looking at. My passenger said that the other 3 to the left just dissapeared and  then reappeared right in the air.  I did not see that myself. The Description of the Object: - It was a very bright-white, possibly from the sun reflecting off it's surface, and it was either the shape of a cigar, but it was tilted. And when it moved, it  stayed titled, no matter which direction it moved, the tilt stayed. Im not sure about the cigar-shape, but I would describe it more like this: If you took a frisbee  and looked at it directlyin front of you looking at the side, so you not seeing a circle, but the other way, it would look like a sstraight line, but slightly ovaled,  but then on top of that, tilt it so that the left end it pointed down and the right end is pointed up. There were no colors or visible features, but it was also very high and far away to be able to clearly see it. When I thought it was traveling downwards closer to the  ground, I really think it was traveling further away. That is how fast it was moving. It, and the other 3 just kept getting smaller and smaller, you could tell they  were moving very fast. And as it moved, like I mentioned, the ""tilt"" of the object never changed. Still driving, I looked to the right up in the sky to see if there were more of these things, and that's when I saw, very, very high up, 3 jets/planes of some kind,  looked to be classic silver/metal in color of a jet, traveling in the same direction as the objects. All 3 jets were moving what seemed to be slow compared to the  other 4 objects. Each jet was leaving a clear small air vapor behind itself which quickly dissapated. As soon as I turned my head away from the 3 jets to the right sky, I watched the 4 objects to the left start moving extremely fast, as if they just caught wind of the  3 jets coming their way. If these were, oviously, military jets sent up to observe or chase these objects, they would most likely have been sent from Willow Grove Air  Force base in Warminster, Pennsylvania, which was roughly 20 miles away from our driving location. They must have gotten there quick, because when I first looked  around after seeing the first object not moving at all, I saw nothing else anywhere. And the 3 jets were pretty high up. At this point we both observed the 4 objects, which seemed to be each about 2 miles apart from each other, and the other 3 further ahead now from the 1st object we  witnessed, traveling at great speed, still with the ""tilt"" not changing at all, all 4 objects within 3 seconds, just took off southbound at incredible speed, and then  they just dissapeared over the horizon. To describe the 1st object, as it was stationary and not moving in better detail, it just hung in the sky, like a cigar, tilted, shining very bright white, as if the  sun was reflecting off it, I am pretty good at judging distance with my eyes, so just a guess, I would say it was about 1-2 miles in length, and roughly about 5-6  miles away. I really wish I could have got a photo of it when is was just sitting there in the sky, but I was driving and it all happened to fast. This was the first time for both of us ever seeing an object we could both say was a UFO for sure. If it was a black-project type object, who knows. But we are  absolutely both sure of what we witnessed, and this was not a mistaken known aircraft. And also we both have never seen such a thing, or expected to ever see such a  thing in this area of Northeast Philadelphia where we were at the time. The entire thing was very strange.  We did look around at other drivers to see if they were looking up at it too, and we did not see anyone looking at it.  Although,  people were driving, it would have been hard to have witnessed it, unless you were stuck at a light, and just happened to look up. I even had my window rolled down with my head out the window, so I know my vision was not obscured in anyway.  That was it.  The objects vanished once they took off  southbound at an incredible high rate of speed, staying at their ""tilt"" in the sky, and 30 minutes later, the sun was gone and that was the end of it.  We witnessed nothing else afterwards as we drove in the opposite direction going home.",2016-11-11T00:00:00,39.99063505273804,-75.14580121369744

I figured it was At approximately 5:45pm my girlfriend stepped outside and noticed a ""UFO"" in the sky and called me outside.  I figured it was probably a plane since Newark airport isn't far away and we frequently have airplanes overhead.  At 5:53pm we noticed a single bright ball of light in the distant sky.  We both felt this was NOT an airplane so she got her camera out.  Then slowly more objects appeared.  The largest/original object grew smaller as it appeared to move away from us.  Simultaneously, one by one, up to 6 objects appeared in the same area of sky.  Then they seemed to move into a single file formation for a duration.  Then this single file formation was broken and the objects spread out and slowly got smaller and disappeared from our visibility.  They appeared to be flying south - southeast (away from us). A mother and daughter came up to the front porch to drop off local political campaign flyers and they saw them as well and were dumbfounded. My girlfriend's 8yr old son saw them too. He quickly went inside because things like this can scare him. At first we thought they were planes reflecting the setting sunlight. However, there were several airplanes in the area and it was obvious by the naked eye and in the photographs that these looked much different and weren't planes. When you zoom into the photos you will see airplanes for comparison. The second theory was that they were meteorites/space debris but they don't change flight paths the way these did. My girlfriend, a professional photographer, got her Canon 5D camera out with Canon 70-300mm zoom lens and took pictures. The picture names have numbers in them so you can see the order of occurrence and track the flight paths accordingly.

(Yes or No): Yes If Yes, Determine Approximate Number and Frequency: Very often Does/Do the Witness(es) Wish to Remain Anonymous?: Yes, for now. Pepe is a fictitious name.      Synopsis of Pepe’s interview in his own words: “On 01Oct16 I took some panoramic photos of El Morro across the Bay of San Juan (El Morro is an old Spanish fortress). I also wanted to take photos of the ferry boat. My wife also took some photos using her camera, a Sony digital model DSC-HX200V. Neither one noticed any hovering object (UFO). On 21Oct16 I decided to review the photos we had taken on 01Oct16. When I zoomed-in on the images I realized there was an unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), a.k.a. UFO, in several of the photos: four (4) taken with the Nikon and one (1) taken with the Sony.”  Analysis of photos: Pepe’s camera is a Nikon digital model D90. Pepe advised the date and time settings of the camera are accurate except that the time is off by 12 hr, meaning the photos were taken during the day (PM) and not at night (AM).  Details of Photos: The object appears to have moved away from El Morro and then back closer to it, apparently always maintaining the same height of a few hundred feet. Sailing boats were in the bay at the time of the sighting. A ferry boat moved left to right (N to S).  Photo 0584 was taken on 01Oct16 at 1:22 PM. Object is observed apparently hovering directly over El Morro or on the water close to it. EXIF version: 0221 F-stop: f/10 Exposure Time: 1/400 sec ISO Speed: ISO-250 Focal Length: 50 mm Max. Aperture: 4.6 35 mm Focal Length: 75 Digital Zoom: 1x (No digital zoom) “Copy 2” and “copy 3” are zoom-ins of the original. The object seems to be saucer shaped. It is tilted relative to the vertical axis by approximately 45 degrees. In the image, the left side is seen lower. The object appears to have on the top a very bright dome in the middle. The light of the dome appears to emanate from it, and not just reflected from the sun. The bottom of the object is observed to be very dark. Of particular interest is the observed concentric halo around the object.   Photo 0600 was taken on 01Oct16 at 1:36 PM. EXIF version: 0221 F-stop: f/10 Exposure Time: 1/400 sec ISO Speed: ISO-250 Focal Length: 18 mm Max. Aperture: 3.6 35 mm Focal Length: 27 Digital Zoom: 1x (No digital zoom) Object moved and is now clearly over the water, left (N) relative to El Morro. It is also either lower or farther away from the camera, or both.   Photo 0604 was taken on 01Oct at 1:45 PM.

On Thanksgiving night (11-24-2016) around 5:45 pm with a house full of family, I stepped out onto my carport for a smoke.  Looking NW towards Urbana/Frederick area, I saw 2 bright orange lights side by side & low on the horizon.  They were coming straight towards my location in Monrovia, MD, at a steady pace and stopped and hovered for about a minute maybe 1 mile from my house.  I estimate their altitude to be around 1000 feet.  Then the first light ascended straight up at a silent but steady pace - the orange light turned white & looked like a distant star, and then it was gone.  Then the second light did the same thing.  I watched for a few more minutes when I noticed 2 more orange lights low on the horizon coming towards me.  One light was faster than the other and it seemed to slow down 2 or 3 times to let the slower light catch up.  These 2 lights stopped and hovered in the same place as the first 2 and then ascend straight up one at a time just like t! he first 2. I watched for a few more minutes and saw nothing more and went inside.  After about 5 minutes, I told my wife about my ""weird"" sighting.  My oldest son overheard my story, and as kids do, wanted to say that I was crazy, so he went outside onto our back deck.  As soon as he got outside, he screamed for everybody to come here now......  Six of us went out onto the deck and we all saw that there were now 7 bright orange lights evenly spaced in a vertical zig-zag pattern at the same spot where the previous 4 lights had ascended straight up.  One by one, all 7 lights ascended straight up until out of sight. This was really weird and the first time I had ever seen anything like this - but there were 6 witnesses to this event.  I doubt if many people saw this because it was dinnertime on Thanksgiving night and the Redskins were playing the Cowboys on TV at this time.  The total event lasted about 25 minutes - it was over around 6:10 pm. As an interesting side note, I offer this.  During this timeframe, I saw no airplanes in the vicinity this entire time.  I live within about 50 miles of 3 major airports (Reagan National, Dulles and BWI) as well as several smaller airports such as Frederick Municipal , Hagerstown, Martinsburg and Montgomery Airpark) - there always seems to be planes in the airspace above us at all different altitudes - except for this night and time.  Within 5 minutes of the last orange light disappearing, there were planes again. We tried to take pictures, but nothing was clear.  However, there is a You Tube video titled ""Family of UFO's Flying over Baltimore"" recorded on 1-31-2016 that shows identical orange lights to what the six of us witnessed.  To date, I have not seen the lights again. Sorry this is so lengthy, but I wanted to get all of the details included since no pictures or video.",2016-12-15T00:00:00,39.3462,-77.2607

This same location on different nights in Oct and Nov others and I have witnessed green glowing falling stars 3 feet off the ground, and tree line yellow and white ones on other occasions.  More activity in this one location then I have seen in my entire 54 years. The large aircraft continued to bother me as I had no explanation for what I AM SURE I SAW. I don't drink nor do drugs. Thus, still wanting answers, I entered some keywords into search engine and to my surprise others across the state of VA have described the same craft at about same tree line area, silent with the lights across the bottom.

It had no lights on it, there was no haze around it and the whole craft was totally luminous.   I got an incredible look at it. even though I was about 3 or 4 miles away, I saw everything.  It came from over the top of this hill and abruptly stopped near the right top of this hill.

Both reports mentioned a sound that they heard and described the sound as a whirring sound. This prompted me to share my information because I also heard a sound too and have never heard this sound before until this experience. I have wanted to share this information for many years and now is the time. I went camping with X at Pearl Lake near Steamboat Springs CO in late fall/September. I had a little boat that I loved to get out on the water with. When we put the boat into the lake and began paddling I immediately got a strange sensation and was so uncomfortable that I paddled to the side and got out right away.  While in the water I looked into the water and it appeared black and could not see down into the water and I just assumed it was very deep. We had a camping spot away from the water a bit and surrounded by trees so that you could not see the lake from that spot. There were only two other campsites occupied at that time because of the lateness of the season. About an hour before dawn we were awoken by a loud noise.  The sound was a whirring sound that was so loud and seemed to penetrate and permeate every fiber of being. I was so scared, I lay in my tent with my eyes wide shut and was afraid to even move. This sound was coming from the direction of the lake and lasted maybe a minute or so and was gone. When it was quiet again I could hear dogs barking form the surrounding area and far away. I then spent the rest of the time until the sun came up laying right outside the tent so that I could see if anything else was going to happen.  I didn’t want to be snuck up on in the tent. When the sun was just coming up two vehicles (the other campers) came past our campsite quickly heading out and away from the camping area.  I am guessing that were they were camping they were also able to see the source of the sound and got out of there as quick as they could. I could never describe exactly the sound until years later I was watching the movie Crocodile Dundee and he used an Australian Bullroarer to contact his partners that were being held captive in the outback. This is the closest to the sound I heard that night that I have ever heard.  If you were to take a Bullroarer and swing it as fast as you could and never let up in revolutions would describe the sound I heard only it was so much more.  So very loud and all enveloping. I was afraid to ever go back to Pearl Lake after that but now I am ready to explore a bit and want to go back again. I believe that what I heard was a USO and that there is something definitely going on in this lake. Would love to know if any other reports have come from this area and wish I could have seen the object as well as hear it. Really wanted to try to explain the sound to you and wonder if what is being described as a whirring sound by others actually is the same sound as what I heard. Looking forward to hearing back! Thank you for your time and interest!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2016-10-21T00:00:00,40.59851098901099,-106.90830989010989

They all coaxed me to go out in the camp yard and see if I could walk up on a deer so I got my coat on and with flashlight in hand went outside.   I saw a deer right away, but I was distracted from the deer by a bright light in the sky which was about half the size of the full moon which was also very bright.  I tried to tell myself it was just the north star and looked at the deer again.  I was distracted again because the light seemed to get brighter and dimmer like a twinkling star.   As I looked at it again for about the third time two smaller lights shot out the side of it and stayed stationary on the same plane in the sky evenly spaced apart.   Suddenly, the big light appeared to shoot straight up followed by the two smaller lights one at a time and very quickly, as if the ufo’s spotted me holding the flashlight on the ground.  They disappeared so fast, I immediately ran back inside and told my dad and grandparents what I saw.  They started laughing and I nearly thought I must have lost my mind because they didn’t believe me, but I knew what I saw and ever since have always been interested in sightings to see if anyone else has  seen anything similar.

Illustrated article is here:  http://adventurebooks.newsvine.com/_news/2007/10/02/997615-how-seeing-a-ufo-changed-my-life   I don't know if I was lucky or not that day.  Twenty-five years ago, I was camped near the highest point on the Wonderland Trail that surrounds Mount Rainier in Washington State - and I saw my one and only Unidentified Flying Object.  Even today, I don't know what it was, but I certainly got a good look at it. My buddy ((male name deleted)) and I hiked out of the Ohanapecosh trailhead, headed for Summerland.  This is the reverse route most people take, as we found out soon enough.  It's several miles of steady 'up' and a quick mile or so of steep 'down' at the end.  So, mostly we met people going the other way, and we beat ourselves up for not checking the route more closely. About a mile or so before we reached the high point of the trail near Panhandle Gap, we set up a backcountry camp about a quarter mile from the main trail.  We had a permit.  We erected the tents and fired up the stoves for dinner.  The sun went down and it got dark.  The stars popped out as if they were trying to get our attention.  The higher altitude and the lack of background city lights made them show up crisper and cleaner than we could remember. I was looking up at that beautiful night and I saw a very large star moving steadily across the sky.  It was as bright as the planet Venus.  I thought it was a satellite at first, since it looked like it was high enough to be in orbit.  I estimated its altitude at more than twenty miles.  It was fascinating.  Just a bright star, moving in a straight line from east to west at a uniform speed.  I pointed it out to ((male name deleted)), and we watched it move across the sky.  We made guesses as to its nature.  I said it was a satellite in orbit maybe.  ((male name deleted)) thought it could be a meteor at first, but it moved too slowly.  We decided it was a satellite. Then, without any warning, the 'satellite' made an instantaneous turn north.  It did this in less time than it takes you to blink your eye. We both swore at the same time.  As we watched this 'star' it continued moving north until is finally disappeared over the horizon.  We had no idea what it was, but we agreed on one thing.  Nothing built by man could possibly make an instant ninety-degree turn like that. No way. Well, I never forgot it.  It got me thinking about writing again, and the very next week, after a five-year layoff, I started writing sci-fi again. The result was to take a novel I had shelved since 1978, Say Goodbye to the Sun, re-edit and release it.  And then things sort of snowballed from there and I never looked back.  But I know that if I had not seen the UFO, my life today would be a lot different.",2016-10-21T00:00:00,,

Campbell, KY Shape: Unknown Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/130/S130706.html,"Large UFO sighted moving slowly just north of Ft. Campbell Army Airfield by military pilots and ATC. At the time of this sighting, I was an Army Chief Warrant Officer 2, CH-47D pilot-in-command stationed at Ft. Campbell, KY.  We had just finished a night mission (without night vision goggles) and were hovering up runway 36 of Ft. Campbell, KY airfield, back to our parking area.  At that time, the 160th Special Ops Aviation assets were not in their present position (per Google maps).  They were located to the west of the departure end of runway 36 (the 4 buildings, 2 of which have light colored roofs).  The currently shown position of Special Ops, was at that time, an unused, and undeveloped, area of the airfield. Because of that, there was typically NO air traffic in our traffic pattern between the east side of the departure end of 36 and the north side of the arrival end of 23.  If you refer to google maps, I’ll try to paint the picture. As we were hovering, both of us pilots at the same time noticed approximately due north of our position a set of lights, probably where the 117 marker is next to the 41 (see google map highways marked north of Campbell Army Airfield).  It was a very dark night, and I believe that there was also a low cloud cover, so it was impossible to tell if we were looking at one very large aircraft with numerous lights, or a flight of smaller aircraft maintaining perfect formation.  All we could assertain were the lights.. there was no form or shape visible in the darkness. Everyone on board, including the 2-3 flight crew in the back, were adept at identifying all the aircraft typically seen in and around our airfield.  This object, or objects, did not reflect the lighting, light spacing, flashing, strobing, or light colors of any of our known aircraft.  I just remember the lights being white.  Without perfect visual reference, and based on other known aircraft light sizes, we can only guess that the object was within 2-3 miles of the airfield and flying very slowly (slower than any of us would fly in a traffic pattern) at perhaps 800-1000 ft elevation.  As we watched this thing, because by now it was clear that the lights were moving perfectly together, so it most likely was one aircraft, it moved very slowly from east to west, perhaps less than 30mph. I clicked the mike and called our tower: ME: “Do you guys see that?” ATC: “Yep. We’ve been watching it for awhile now.” ME: “What is it?” ATC: “We have no idea.” ME: “Can you see it on radar?” ATC: “No.  We are going to call The Center and see if they can see it.” (Center couldn’t see anything either)   Our ATC was not military. They were all civilian, many of them the FAA guys fired by Reagan, so they were top-notch, experienced air traffic controllers. If this were one aircraft, and was in the position that I am estimating, I would say that this aircraft was huge, perhaps several hundred yards long. There were at least the 4-5 of us in my Chinook, and the 2-3 guys in the tower, that saw it. I’m sure there were probably more people on the airfield that night that saw it too. It was hard to miss. And then, frankly, I can’t remember what happened, I think it just disappeared. We all agreed we weren’t going to report it or say anything to anybody about it.  All pilots fear the FEB (Flight Evaluation Board), and we figured that is what would happen to us.  I don’t know why we felt that way.  I do not think I made a note of this incident in my logbook, if I did, it was something cryptic that I have been unable to find.  But I was stationed at Ft. Campbell from 1986 - 1990.

From the car I could tell there were three dome-shaped windows on two sides of the object and another one off the bottom of the craft.  Lights were on inside. There was a small farm house between me and the UFO so I decided to go just past the house to get a better look.  When I got to where I should have been able to see it better, it was gone.  I didn't see it leave. I didn't see it disappear; it was just gone.   I spent the next minute or two looking around for it, but it was nowhere to be found.

It seemed like it was not that high (in our skies/atmosphere like any other pane would be...but this was no plane)  It was 4-5 times as big as any plane I have seen flying over me and I am 51 years old.  It was completely silent and I was looking up a little to the coast but almost over my neighboring suburb.  It was not like it was far away and just a dot or fast squiggle, this was a triangular aircraft that flew smoothly and silently in a straight line down our coast/over land coast side of Perth city.  This aircraft operated on a completely level than anything I have seen before.  IF it was a government aircraft, that scares me more than if it was extraterrestrial.  I watched it from the top of my driveway through the sky southward until it was too small to see (on the horizon that you can see over the house across the road, quite a long way) and it traveled that in about 10 or so seconds.  I had a good 3-5 second look at this thing and I am still awestruck.

The night sky was crystal clear and even with the full moon, the stars were bright as ever.  Roughly 30 minutes into my moon watch, I noticed something ""gliding"" north to south fairly low overhead.  The light configuration was odd in that there two steady white lights spaced slightly apart with a third whitish-green light between them that seemed to pulse slightly somehow, as opposed to a blinking light on a standard aircraft.  In fact, there were no blinking lights anywhere on this object that I could see.  And it made no sound whatsoever.   As I was watching this object move further south, two larger (or lower) orange round objects moving in tandem, each with what looked like yellow and orange light striations coming up from them at an angle, also slid by overhead moving north to south and completely silent.  The first object turned slightly south eastward and began to head slowly out over the ocean.  At this point, I was still trying to believe that this was an aircraft of some sort, but the object stopped suddenly out over the water and became fixed in the sky where it also appeared to progressively become brighter and brighter until I noticed what looked like colors mixing in with the original bright white light.  I just kept staring at this thing, trying to come up with a ""logical"" explanation for what it could be. After 10 minutes or so, I took a chance and ran up to my house to grab my binoculars; I was afraid that the object would disappear if I took my eyes off of it.  But when I got back down to my bench, it was still there and I was able to see it clearly and with great detail through the binoculars.  I still can't find the right words to describe the colors I saw on/in/around the object.  They possessed a brilliance and clarity and purity like I've never seen.  They were not flashing, but rather pulsating and shifting somehow.  Red, green, blue, white, violet...  There were no shafts or beams striking out from the object.  The colors were cohesive and unified, forming a fixed sphere.  The colors shifted and morphed across the object but I never saw them stay still.  Brilliant white light lines appeared interspersed the individual colors somehow, almost like borders but not really because it all pulsed at such a high rate that these white lines were never stationary.  At one point, the ! sphere seemed to elongate into a cylinder and then it returned to a sphere. I called my husband, who was out of town, to describe to him in real time what I was looking at.  I also called my son, who lives a block away and asked him to come over to see what he thought about the odd thing.  We both watched it though binoculars for nearly an hour.  Eventually, the cold air off the water and the night moisture forced us indoors, but I went back out later to see if the object was still there...  It was gone. Neither of us have any idea what it was nor have we ever seen anything like it before.  Suffice it to say, it was spectacular.",2017-01-19T00:00:00,,

I could clearly make out its shape, which was spherical, and approximately 22 feet in diameter.  It had five lights in total; one extremely bright white spotlight at the six o'clock position, and four lights, comparable to an airplane's strobe lights, blinking in a! random sequence.  Starting from top to bottom, the lights went red, green, white, and amber.   The craft maintained an altitude of around 15 feet from the ground, and made a noise similar to the electronic hum of a refrigerator.  After about 15-20 minutes of observation, the craft shot out a white flair that sizzled in the same manner of a flare gun used for nautical purposes.  The flare rose high above the pine trees around my property, only to land on the main road in front of my house.  The flair touched down, and then elevated to about three feet off the ground, made a sound that I can only equate to the beginning of Pink Floyd's ""Welcome to the Machine"", and then took off at an astonishing speed.   When I glanced back to its source, the craft had completely vanished.",2016-09-22T00:00:00,36.9559,-76.5363

She called and woke me up around 01:15 New Years morning and asked to be picked up in 30 minutes.  I walked out of my apartment at 2636 grand avenue in San Diego. I walked down the walkway to my car parked on the north side of the building.  On my way to the car I looked up and noticed several Amber lights moving slowly over the la Jolla hills to the north. I thought it strange, but San Diego being a big military city I figured that it was helicopters or some military aircraft. I got in my jeep with the top down and headed north on the I 5 from pacific beach and noticed the lights again as I approached the la Jolla parkway exit and noticed there were 7 or 8 Amber lights at what seemed like an altitude of about 1000 feet above the hill moving extremely slowly from east to west in a sloppy triangle formation! with the rear light occasionally leapfrogging to the front of the formation. It seemed the lights were slightly ahead of me as I proceeded onto la Jolla parkway towards the north west and when I got to the top of the hill and stopped at the traffic light at the intersection of la Jolla parkway and la Jolla shores drive the lights appeared to stay stationary directly above me at an estimated altitude of 1000-2000 feet.  I did not hear any noise other than traffic whatsoever. At this point I concluded if they were helicopters I would surely be hearing them.  I turned north on la Jolla shores drive and proceeded Approximately 1/2 mile to the bath and tennis club and my wife was waiting curbside and got in the jeep. I turned around to a south heading and told my wife about the lights and pointed them out to her. She thought them strange as well. At that time they seemed about 1/2 mile to the west and picking up steady speed. By the time I got back to the traffic light 1/2 mile! south at la Jolla shores drive and la Jolla parkway the light! s seemed at least 5 miles out to sea already and continuing west/northwest.

I exited out of the east side of the building and headed southward towards the parking lot. As I cleared the building, off to the right, something in the western sky caught my eye.  I looked over, and there, hovering over the farm behind my place of employment, were several orange lights.  They were rather large and flat in shape, each one comprised of a single light in the middle and two beams of light extending out on either side. The lights were hovering in a somewhat vertical formation that appeared slightly like a sideways W, and it quickly became obvious to me that they were not airplanes because they were not moving at all.  It also didn’t seem like they could have been helicopters because they were making no sound whatsoever, and they were close enough that had they been helicopters I would certainly have been able to hear them. Because the lights were holding so still it was impossible for me to tell if they were being produced by one single object with multiple lights, or if each light represented a separate object. As I stared at the phenomenon in front of me, my first inclination was to run back into the building and tell the other employees from my company that were still inside to come out and witness it with me.  But then I thought to myself that if I did that there’s a chance the objects might do something in my absence, and I would miss it.  So I decided to just stand there in the parking lot and observe. The objects continued to hover above the farm for what seemed like another couple of minutes.  Then, suddenly, as if there was some coordination between them, they began to move.  At this point it became obvious that I was not observing one single object, since they were clearly moving in relationship to one another.  The lights at the bottom of the formation began moving upward so they were more parallel with the ones at the top. The motion that these objects exhibited at that moment was different than I have ever seen from conventional aircraft, as some of them were actually moving diagonally.  The closest thing I can describe their motion to is that of fireflies. Then, as the objects at the bottom had reached a position where they were more parallel with those at the top, one by one they began to blink out.  Since it was dark, I couldn’t tell if they just turned their lights off, or if they actually disappeared.  But, bottom line, they were gone. I stood there for a moment, baffled, wondering what it was I just witnessed.  Then I got in my car and drove home. That weekend I pondered over the event.  I couldn’t think of a rational explanation for what I had seen, and I wished there had been someone else who had witnessed it with me.  Then, it occurred to me that maybe there was.  I recalled that my co-worker who sat next to me had left only about 30 seconds before I did.  Surely, I thought, the lights were there when he had left the building. So, the next time we worked together I decided to ask him if he had seen them too.  His response was an enthusiastic yes.  The reason I had not seen him out in the parking lot with me was because he had already gotten in his car and was watching the lights through his car window. We later had a chance to discuss the event more in detail.  His description of the event was very similar to mine:  The lights were hovering, then, after a couple of minutes, they began to move, and then disappeared.  While we were discussing our experience, the girl that sat across the aisle from us began to comment that she and some of her friends had had similar experiences, and I realized that this kind of thing is becoming far more common than it used to be. As far as what the explanation is for what I saw, I am torn.  Part of me thinks it could be evidence for extra-terrestrial life, but the more skeptical part of me thinks it could have been a clever hoax.  For now, the incident remains unexplained.",2016-09-22T00:00:00,40.55990645161291,-111.96486774193548

I decided to do a selfie video on my IPhone 6S, while sliding down the dunes.   After leaving later that night, headed to Silver City, NM, I was viewing the video, and noticed a silvery, metallic, somewhat round object that seemed to flip around in the sky above me.  It appeared to dart around somewhat but that could also be from me being in motion sliding down the dunes.

I live in Phoenix Arizona.  I am an adult male, never used drugs in my life, non alcohol user, no mental issues and of sound mind and body.  I am the type of person generally speaking that has to see something with my own eyes, see it, touch it, taste it, feel it or witness something to believe it when it comes to things of this nature.  I am just an average Joe with above average street smarts and intelligence in the game of life.  Arizona is known for having high visibility and fosters the type of environment where things can be seen from a distance. I have never in my life seen anything like I did On Friday October 21st 2016 approximately 10:50pm.  I saw something in the sky in the northern part of the skyline when I was taking out my trash to my dumpster.  What drew my attention to it was the light it emitted and how it moved.  The light was all one color and of a white light clear in nature.  This was a flying object in the sky that moved like nothing I have ever seen in my lifetime.  This was not something of commercial or military aircraft in nature.  If it was one of ours it was of discrete nature or kept very secret. I have seen stealth bombers and fighter jets in person and this was NOT one of those.  I have never in my life witnessed anything of this nature previously.  I used to laugh and have doubt at people that claimed to have seen things of this nature and were so adamant about it.  My opinion now has changed after what I witnessed. The way this thing moved laterally side to side was like nothing I have ever seen in my life.  I will never forget that aspect of it. It was THAT fast the horizontal/lateral movement was just unreal.  I stood and observed this thing in the sky for about 6 or seven minutes.  I saw one of our aircraft approach it.  I knew it was one of ours because it had red and blue lights and moved entirely different from how this thing moved.  When our aircraft approached it whatever it was I saw disappeared in an instant. I checked online and on the news and there was nothing about this reported that I am aware of.  Someone knows something about this as it was investigated by our aircraft approaching it.  Another piece of the puzzle is that Luke Air Force base is close to where I live and also we are really not that far from an installation known as Area 51.  What I saw was not something created by mankind.  Again, if it was it was something kept very discrete and secret.

At the north end of the street is an intersection with a row of houses going east-west.  To the north of those houses is farmland. We had made the last turn north to our destination.  About 100’ north of the turn, at about the 9 o’clock position, we saw a very intense white ball-shaped object about 50’ to the west of the road.  It appeared to be about 20” in diameter.  It stood out in the total darkness.  Because we had just come out of an Orionid meteor shower, my first thought was this was part of that.  However, my family stargazes at night and have never seen anything without some sort of downward curve.  I also recalled my encounter during daylight two months earlier; both objects were alike.  It was moving straight north no more than about 30’ above the tree tops and traveling up to about twice our speed.  It was not descending or moving in a downward angle.  We watched it as we continued on about 400’.  The trees and final house then blocked our view.  It appeared to have an approximately 16” heavy tail like that of a comet’s tail, but I don’t know if it actually did, or if that was my brain’s perception of a! blur in tracking it and it was actually more of an oval-shape.

Throughout the whole thing, the same lights were still in the same places but every now and then it would seem to dart out a little bit, but then return to the exact same location.   Actually that movement was what really baffled me because it would quickly dart sideways and then return to original position.  I’ve never seen anything in the sky move that way.

When I was 6 years old, my family lived on the outskirts of Nashville, Tennessee in the country.   We had a paved driveway that was next to the house.  One afternoon, I was outside playing on the driveway with my Hot Wheels matchbox cars.  At some point, I recall seeing what looked like a floating aluminum pie plate (bottom facing forward) coming toward the house (at the time I said it looked like the bottom of a Jiffy Pop Popcorn pan).  It looked as though it was slowly rotating and moved silently but quickly toward the house.  At first, I wondered if it was going to crash as it was flying so low and was so large, but it continued on its trajectory and silently floated overhead.   As the front approached me, I realized that it was actually a very long cigar-shaped, silver-colored cylinder.  As it passed overhead it appeared to be so low that I got excited and jumped to see if I could touch the bottom of it.   When I couldn't touch it, I realized that my perception was clouded and I couldn't tell how close it was.  As it passed overhead, the body of the craft was wider than our entire house, such that the area where I stood became darkened from the shadow it cast.   There were some square dark gray hatches in places on the hull and as the craft was passing overhead, I remember clearly noting that the craft was higher than the roof of the house (perhaps 20 feet over the rooftop).  I have no visual or auditory evidence to support it, but at some point, I felt that the craft was occupied and the occupants were aware of my presence.  This scared me, and as a result, I ran inside the kitchen and told my mother that there was a big silver thing flying over the house.  She was washing dishes from lunch.  I remember being annoyed that it was taking her so long to come outside, but when I ran back out, she quickly joined me.  By this time, the object had passed and my mother and I both saw what appeared as a small aluminum pie plate the size of a golf ball rotating off into the distance.   My mother saw the craft as it departed.   To me, she didn't appear to be impressed by the sighting, but it is clear that she accounted the event to my father.  I recall the next day, we were watching a football game and my father pointed out the GoodYear blimp.  He asked me if that was what I had seen.   I told him it was not, because what I saw was shaped like a giant silver pencil and had no writing on it.  He also pointed out the undercarriage and the propellers to me.  I told him that it had no carriage underneath and there was no motor and no propellers and that it was slowly turning and made no noise.  At the end of my account, my father sternly told me to say that I saw a blimp.  Over 50 years later, I have always remembered this, and my life experiences have not explained away the sighting as a blimp.

Its been years sense this happened and unfortunately I didn’t know who to go to about this information until after watching The Phoenix Incident at the end of the movie which led me to you.  I remember it as if it happened yesterday.  We had this couple over to install a new central air conditioning system in our house on East Bear Swamp Rd in Hertford NC. I believe this happened in spring of 97.  It was just cool enough outside to wrap up in my Garfield sleeping blanket.  The couple had just finished installing the AC unit in our house and had ordered pizza that they were eating with my parents in the studio my father and I had built inside the barn out back.  I came outside and laid down on our cement driveway and leaned my back onto the brick of the house beside the garage entrance.  I laid there for about 30 min when in the distance I could see 6 lights coming from the direction of Edenton moving north towards Hertford. I could barely make them out because of ! the city lights coming from Edenton.  I kept watching them thinking to myself it was probably just helicopters on their way to Blackwater Base located near Elizabeth City. But as I watched them more I could distinctly make out they were not individual aircraft, it was just two.  How could I tell it was just two?  Because the stars would disappear behind each 3 lights, thus making them a triangular shape.  I quickly jumped up and ran as fast as I possibly could to the barn where the couple and my parents were. I yelled at them to run to the front of the house and see these UFOs.  We all ran back to the front and watched in awe as they went overhead.  Not a single sound…..nothing, it was as if they were giant triangle balloons.  A white/silverfish light at each corner.  One triangle was ahead of the other, side by side. Like a formation.  For example. A A  As they got directly above our heads we could identify almost how big they were.  They were at LEAST 3 football fields wide each if not more.  As we followed them towards the back of the house I quickly remembered to look at my watch to see what time it was, I believe it was around 9:15 or 10:15 at night.  Sense my uncle worked for the DEA, I wanted to make sure I got as much info as I had so that I could tell him. I was young so I thought maybe my uncle would know something about them.  Anyway, as we watched them fly over and towards Hertford, we could slowly begin to see a VERY CLEAR shape to them as the lights of Hertford were blotted  out in the sky of these triangle shaped craft.  We watched them until we couldn’t see them any longer. Now, here is where it gets VERY weird.  Remember how I looked at my watch and remembered the time?  Well the next night I thought to myself….why the hell not go outside about 15 min before the last time I saw them and see if they appear again. So….that’s just what I did. I went outside and stood in our driveway, scanning the open fields and the far off tree line. And to my utter breath taking surprise…low and behold there they were again. Except this time…there wasn’t just two. There were three. I couldn’t believe it. I was in absolute shock. Almost to the point of fear. I ran to the front door of our house and into the bedroom of my parents, woke them up and told them that the ships were back. I remember my father saying “You’re kidding right?” my mother said “Are you serious?” and I said “Yes im fucking serious, get your asses up NOW and get outside before they are gone!” So we all ran outside and we stood in front of our house in just utter shock. Just in disbelief.  The fo! rmation was strange though. The two like before were in the same pattern, but the third was not. It was way off in the distance. For example. A A A  I looked at my watch again and saw it was the EXACT same time as before. And I wish to god I could say that these were some sort of military aircraft or coast guard or SOMETHING of this world. But these things were HUGE, too big for there not to be any sound what so ever, and going only about a mile an hour. VERY slow. No flashing lights like on a plane or helicopter, to markings of any type, I even used my binoculars to look at it that I had grabbed on the way out of the house and it was like looking into nothingness. Just pure black. We watched these ufos just as we did the last time, until they disappeared into the horizon of Hertford. Now I am not sure if the police had been notified in Hertford either one of those nights. But the second night we saw these things we all of a sudden heard many many sirens coming from Hertford, police sirens. Also after these sightings…I noticed 2 weird scars on my left and right hand. One was oval shaped and another was in the perfect shape of an L. the oval being on my left and the L on my right. My uncle did ask me at one point “after I my parents and I told him about the sighting” if I had looked at the time before AND after the sighting, to see if more time had passed by than there should have been. I told him no, I had only looked at my watch once, both times. I never looked at my watch –after- the sightings. Which this was weird that he had asked me this. I never did tell him of the scars though. I’ve never told anyone of the scars until now actually. Because I honestly don’t know if they were a result of these sightings or not. And I don’t want to say anything that’! s not true or get any hopes up. But as I said, I did have scars after these sightings that I had never seen before nor did I know where they came from. Also, I think I should let you know, this wasn’t the only sighting I have seen.  There was one other, but it was on the same road not but a mile from my house, and only about a night later. I am not sure if I need to make a separate report or not so I will just mention it on here. Not in full detail but the 3rd sighting was of orbs, and involved a family that lived down the road from us. Which one of the members was a cop. If you wish to know more about this as well then let me know and I will file another report.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. The couple that installed our AC system on the first sighting, I do not have their contact information as this took place years ago. But if it is needed then I am almost sure I can get their contact information still. As for my parents, I live with them now and they would have no problem at all answering any questions you also may have for them. Ever sense these sightings I always look to the stars, hoping to see them again. Even though they frighten the heck out of me…I cant help but be curious in trying to figure out what they are, who they are, where they come from and what do they want. What is the end game.  Also I will send some pictures of where this took place and pictures of a map of the area, direction of ufo and direction of where we were looking and where we were.

They were not moving, they were very large and defined, all exactly alike, covering a good amount of sky, and they were not solid; I could see right through them to the sky behind them.  I distinctly recall seeing a wispy cloud floating by in one of the rectangles. I didn’t see where the source of this huge pattern of light could be coming from, and in an instant they moved very rapidly, all together, upward in the sky, in a q! uick vertical motion and the “light” went out. I did not hear any sound. The sky was then exactly as it had been: dark, with stars. This all happened in probably 2 seconds; I was just about to say to my husband, “Do you see this?” but didn’t have time!  I’ve never seen anything like this in my 53 years and I’m not one for flights of fancy. The only thing I can think of to compare it to (in a way), was some years ago when I was on a stargazing trip out on a boat and the tour guide had one of those laser pointers, which he would very briefly, point into the sky--- I remember how far the light seemed to travel and the way it lit up the sky in the area he pointed to….this rectangular light reminded me of that.  But I’m not familiar with lasers and if they would be capable of doing the above as I described, with this huge shape and pattern. So I decided to search online and report what I saw here.

Then suddenly zipped straight up into the sky, unable to see further due to clouds moved in. They seem to appear in the primary lighting area, the ""point end"" of triangle, was ""brief"" - Flash of light. Consider a strobe light flash; but not the same as a lightning flash (there's no storms in area) as if ""images were being taken below them"".  One flash for each ""stop"" movement before taking off. All 3 looked alike, from appearance: all were triangular in shape, had lights underneath - appears to be white, non-blinking, stationary lights. 2 Witnesses were able to count the lights for a total of 9 primary lights and a possibility of 21 secondary lights?  (Movement was too quick; a photo shoot by the reporter came out ""blurred light movement"",  unable to process or post image).  It made some type of a noise as a ""hum"" sound, that which one would consider as ""electrical hum"" pitch; only when these 3 moved to another position. Reporter of this post has seen this before - 1966, 1986, 1996, and now 2016 - in time frame of Fall/Winter (except 1996, was very early Spring and a different object, which appeared to be two wheels, one big wheel (outside) with one wheel (inside).)

It appeared that USAF Pilots took off in the area shortly after their manifestation. Too dark outside to determine if the USAF Pilots were responding to the event. The animals, such as dogs, cats -  dogs whimpered and cats scampered into ""hiding"". The digital system when into error, electronics malfunctioned; DVR and Modem rebooted. Phones were disabled; more so when overhead, attempt to take photo of one of the three, failed. One of the object which was overhead, appeared to be at least a size of a football field (Best guess) - far SMALLER than the one seen earlier; especially 1966 - when Reporter had actually been in contact with aliens, which currently are known as Greys. US Government has been with this reporter since 1st contact in 1966.

At 20:48 hours on 10/01/2016 I was standing on my deck (Southern Exposure) overlooking Silver Lake.  I witnessed a craft of unknown origin while waiting for my Daughter and Granddaughter.  We were going to pick up my Wife from work in Brewer.  I was looking to the east and was watching what I thought was an airplane in its flight path for Bangor International Airport, while I waited outside.  It was not emitting any noise. At that point, I noticed the perspective of the lights had not changed; I stared a little closer studying them for any changes.  It was hovering at approximately 300 to 500 feet (estimated) in altitude.  It appeared to be static for approximately two minutes with three very bright and large lights, all side by side. I called to my daughter to come outside to make sure that I had seen what was going on in front of me.  At that point in an arc the craft ascended slowly to the north and west and had changed configuration.  The lights grew wider apart and then after the maneuver leveling off at what appeared angels 7 and proceeded in a north-northwesterly direction.  Based on my intimate knowledge of the area I estimated the craft to be 5 miles away from the point where I was standing.  These large bright lights reflected on the lake even though the object was not over the lake but in fact was a couple miles beyond it. Initially the lights were close together almost touching, and then spread apart, then returning together.  In perspective the lights were two (side view) with one red light. We did not have a camera or cell phone handy to take pictures, but were mesmerized by the action(s) of this craft of unknown origin.  It took approximately 60 seconds for the craft to traverse the distance behind the horizon.  My daughter and I conquered that we had seen the same thing(s) and wrote down all of the information.  We also drew diagrams of what we had seen. Diagram 1:  green is tree line, yellow are lights.

We were looking at the horizon to the west into the ocean, for the moon, (which there wasn't) and noticed a steak in the clouds.  Then out of the clouds suddenly a bright round light appeared.  We were saying to one another it was an airplane, but it just stayed in one location for about 3 minutes and then withdrew from its origin in seconds.  With no residual light to be seen or any new light originating.  We all felt like it was peculiar? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

2 brilliant lights.,Portland,TN,2016-12-01T19:45:00,light,4 minutes +,"Occurred : 12/1/2016 19:45  (Entered as : 12/01/2016 19:45) Reported: 12/1/2016 8:22:40 PM 20:22 Posted: 12/5/2016 Location: Portland, TN Shape: Light Duration:4 minutes +",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/131/S131564.html,"2 Brilliant Lights Radiant white rather large light (larger than commercial jet landing lights, even at close proximity), with hints/twinkles of many colors.(NOT VENUS) A bit overwhelming to view. Different than landing lights on commercial jets. Stationary or very slow moving.  To the NNW of Portland TN.  Visible, heading from 52 West by I-65 Entrance headed towards Orlinda.  We were on way to airport so had to move on and leave without further investigating. Bright light really grabbed our attention and we were trying to figure it out, pulled over on entrance to I-65 to watch and a second brilliant light appeared out of nowhere to the left (South or West) of original light. Extremely clear skies tonight.  This light just blipped into existence unlike aircraft approaching from distances which can obviously be viewed for a while before lights become brighter. Same intensity and brilliance. It moved around the original light to the north and then back around towards  the west a! nd south and became dim.  At this point I thought we saw some flashing lights on the 2nd object as it headed south or south west.  Assumed possible military testing/training out of Clarksville.  The originally light stayed in place while the other circled around it (or looked to do so).  Maybe helicopters?  Either way, out of the ordinary - we come from an aviation family and are used to spotting all sorts of lights and craft.  Fun seeing something different!  We got fuzzy video after the 2nd light moved on --- it just popped out of nowhere, wish we could have gotten that on video- pretty impressive.",2016-12-05T00:00:00,36.5817,-86.5164
