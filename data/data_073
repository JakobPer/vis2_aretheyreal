I was with my father and brother in the driveway of the ranch where I work.  It is located just south of Casper, Wyoming.   We were looking at the stars because it was a particularly clear night.  The three of us noticed a point of light, equivalent to a bright star, moving across the sky.  In my estimation, it traveled 30 degrees of arc in approximately 30 seconds as we watched.  It is difficult to gauge its distance from us but we heard no noise from it.  It was travelling in an approximately northward direction, and in the north half of the sky.  My father looked away at this point, but my brother and I continued to watch.  As the object approached the area of Polaris, we saw it brighten, accelerate, and disappear all within a few moments.   The regularity of its behavior indicates that the object was a craft of some sort.

I was working on Feb. 15th 2012 from 1800 to 0600.At exactly 2047 hours I was on the phone with my brother just talking about work.  As I was sitting here I started to hear a very loud noise outside of the guard shack.  I then had thought to myself that it was a big rig truck coming on to site to drop some sort of equipment to drill, I had then proceeded to tell my brother hold on so I can go sign the person driving the truck in.  As i walked outside to look, there was nothing outside at all and the noise kept getting louder and louder. I had at that point thought maybe a helicopter was flying very close by so I thought nothing of it at all and continued to talk to my brother.  As I sat back down, I looked out the window and screamed to my brother what the F*@& is that.  He said ""What are you talking about"" I told him I will call you right back i need to get a picture of this.  I ran outside exactly at 2049to try and get a photo of this very big flying aircraft of some sort to show others.  I took two photos of it...  Nothing showed up except a very distant 3 white dots.  This thing was HUGE! If i were to put it next to the moon it probably would take up about 1/10th of it. It looked almost identical to a Stingray of some sort.  It had 3 lights that flashed from blue to white. It was very very close to me, I'd have to say about 150 yards away and about 10 stories from the ground.  It was very loud and moving very slow, and lets put it this way it was so loud that the ground was shaking and it was moving slower than a car traveling roughly 30 MPH on a highway.  I don't know what to think of this sighting which is why I’m writing this.  I hope to find some other people with a similar sighting, somewhat close to where I saw it.

Who saw it:  Just me, myself, and I When I saw it:  2049 (8:49PM) for about 60 seconds What I saw:  UFO Description of what I saw:  A very dark triangular shaped aircraft flying very low to the ground and really loud (as loud as a Helicopter but not the same sound), It had 3 (maybe 4) blue and white flashing lights.

I got up at 3:45 a.m. because I had to use the bathroom. After using the restroom, I came back to my room and laid down.  I had my bedroom window open.  I got on FB via my cell and was checking my status at this time.  Then I laid back down, and I couldn't fall asleep so I began looking out the window from my bed. This is when I saw a fireball drop from the sky, I immediately went to the window, to see where this object came from and saw, a silhouette of some type of plane gliding silently in the sky.  I could not make out what it was as there were no lights on this object. The fireball was falling, as it fell it split into about seven smaller fireballs.  They look white with a tail, actually they look like falling stars or rather balls of fire.  I thought it was a bomb and that we were under some terrorist attack. I was facing East, towards my parents home.  Actually, the white balls of fire, never touched the ground but, just stayed floating then they disappeared. I tried to wake up my roommate as I was afraid.  Then, I could not sleep, I was worried as my friend wouldn't wake so I stayed in bed looking out the window.  I didn't close it. I observed a small plane circling the area of where this occurred for about fifteen minutes and then it left.  Then, it was almost morning, around 4:30 to 5:00 a.m.  Now it is almost daylight.  Again, this object, came back to the same spot and dropped another fireball down.  I can only tell you that even though it was almost daylight, I could not see clearly the object that dropped this fireball, but only that you could faintly make out that it was some sort of craft, but invisible, no color, no lights and you can see it gliding away right when the fireball drops from it.  Again, this ball of light split into approximately five or six smaller balls of light, they were white.  I can say, I thought it was a comet, or what looks like a comet as when it moved or rather glided it had a tail emitting from the opposite direction. But then I saw these balls of light flying around, and then disappeared for a second time.  Shortly after, now panicked I kept calling my mom, and she was up.  She said that, the only thing she has noticed for the past three days at this hour, including the day of my sighting, was that her house, kept losing power that it felt like something had been draining the power from her home and her lights kept coming off and on and her battery back up would come on.  The lights though would dim she said as if it was being drained. There are several You Tubes that were captured and you can see clearly that they are in the direction of where I stated.

So I did, and I saw 2 bright objects. They looked circular in shape, and look like they were just sitting there in the sky, noy moving, not flying, not blinking nothing. Just one bright light and another bright light. At first they sort of resembled stars, but way brighter. So I looked around it was pretty bright out when these two lights were in the sky, and there were absolutely no stars in the sky. But I still thought maybe they were stars or planets maybe glowing in the sky from the sun. I eventually watched these two objects until the sun started to set. This is where I could determine if these two objects were. As I saw this I realized this was unique, a maybe once in a lifetime chance to see something like this. So I grab my cellphone for my camera because my actual came! ra is broken, and I took two pictures along with a video. As the sun set, the darkness started to take over and eventually the first light would just dim away, as would the second.

The night was cold, clear, and many stars in the sky.  My dog started barking wildly, which she doesn't do unless something is about. There is a large tract of wooded land beyond my back fence, and this was where she was directing her focus.  I let my other dog out and she proceeded to the same spot beyond my fence. I saw nothing so went back inside.   The dogs were now barking more so I went back out; at this point they were barking up a tree at the back.  I shone a flashlight up the tree and saw a raccoon staring down.  This was the first raccoon I had seen in twenty years of living here.  As I was looking up at the raccoon, I noticed a very bright light to my left, coming from the SW and heading NW, at an altitude of about 1000 ft., much lower than commercial flights into Warwick State Aiport.  The light was orangy-yellow, about the brightness of Jupiter, and was ! surrounded by multi-colored smaller lights. There was no sound at all.   It appeared to pick up speed greatly as it passed to my north...a very smooth gliding but fast pace. I watched it through the pine trees until it was out of my sight to the NE.  It was much faster than any plane heading toward the state airport and was much lower in the sky than the usual planes.  The brightness of the light did not change during my total viewing, nor did the brightness of the colored lights that surrounded it.   This is not my first sighting in this area (Perryville section of South Kingstown). Three years ago I stood right under a large bright yellowish light, only 200 feet above me and just over a power transformer,  that had an electric-like green light at the 'tail.'   This object also smoothly pioted and glided away as I watched it dumb-struck outside of my car.  I believe this area is a 'hotspot.'",2012-03-13T00:00:00,,

As we watched for the next 20 minutes or so, there had to have been at least 30 of these lights one after another moving up the coast, some singly, some in groups.  Some of them were red/orange in color as reported on this page, occasionally there would be one that was closer to yellow in color.   None of us had a camera capable of taking a good image of the lights though.  My father in law thought perhaps they were some sort of lighted balloon part of some sort of celebration, but seeing this page I am not so sure.  I’m not sure at all what they were or could have been.  But I figured after reading some of these reports, I’d share what we saw.",2011-08-07T00:00:00,38.5562,-75.0692

We all looked up and saw above our homes, a little to the south, there was what looked to be basketball-sized, almost clear shape with what looked something like a fire burning inside.  Similar to what you would imagine a hot air balloon flame might look like, but smaller.  It was much lower than a plane would fly. The edges were not solid and it moved at a steady speed in an East North East direction.   The flame inside the ""ball"" seemed to flicker and change between a reddish and orange color, and it was completely silent.  It moved very straight, and may have moved higher but it was hard to tell.  We all watched it until it disappeared behind the tree line, which is probably close to a mile away. I have to add that it is an extremely clear night with many visible stars.  We live in an open area without a lot of lights, so the night sky is very visible.  There was also no wind whatsoever.

I live on M-50 and I've been seeing weird lights outside on clear nights. Tonight is another clear night, and there was the same bright white light I've seen before, just hovering over M-50 and the fields. It seemed to have a bit of an aura around the light this time.  It was hovering the air for a while, I would say between 8:00 and 10:00 pm.  I saw a LOT of other aircraft flying by it. I lost count of how many airplanes I saw coming through the sky and flying near this hovering object.  There were also other white lights blinking around it in the sky.  The planes were higher up than the object, but flying all around it, so that means this ufo was much closer to earth.  I think there might have been a few helicopters. I got my binoculars out in an attempt to get a closer look. It was still hard to see the shape of the object because of the light, but it almost looked like it was flying saucer shaped! But like I said, I am not absolutely certain of the shape. Any! way, I had my mom come out and look at it, so she saw it too. I went inside and then came back out a little later. The light had moved further away, and instead of being white, it had change to a red/orange color. I used my binoculars again, and watched it move further away. It got far enough to where I could no longer see it with my own eyes, only with the binoculars, and then eventually completely disappeared from my sight. With the amount of airplanes and helicopters I saw moving around this thing, I am convinced that others are looking into this. I did see one car pull off the road, and I saw some other cars slowing down, so I want to assume that other people are seeing this.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Jupiter and Venus??

At first, he thought it was just a nearby helicopter, since military aircraft/helicopters frequently fly over our house.  The light really caught the witness's attention when it zig-zagged three times, each time moving a distance of six or seven degrees in a fraction of a second.   The witness reported seeing two rows red and green blinking lights, but this could have been due to atmospheric instability.  The witness then ran inside and got two more people (including the author of this report).  The point of light was still visible and appeared to be stationary.  From time to time, however, it would wobble rapidly from side to side, rapidly oscillating an angular distance of one to two degrees.  The light slowly got dimmer.   The craft remained stationary for an hour, descending at a rate slightly faster than the nearby stars, moving closer and closer to the nea! rest star (Deneb, in Cygnus).  It was roughly the same brightness as Deneb.   Everyone got cold and went inside, but two people went outside to look for it again about 85 minute after the initial sighting.  The point of light wasn't where it was previously.   As they searched, the two observers spotted movement in their peripheral vision and automatically directed their attention to it.  A point of light about 30 degrees to the left of the place where the first point of light was moved rapidly overhead, crossing the entire sky in under a second, and then disappeared behind the trees.   One witness, formerly in the Air Force, said the point moved at least 100 times faster than any aircraft he'd ever seen.  The point of light did not change intensity, color or shape as it moved.

And they stayed like that, perfectly still, for about two or three minutes before they began to spin and rotate kinda slowly.  I think they were maintaining their perfect triangle shape but the shape seemed to morph as it spun in the sky.  And then one of them shot off to the right and disappeared and it was just two that were sort of orbiting each other.  They stayed like that for a while and then another floated over and took its place and it continued like this for like 15 minutes until they all floated away from one another and eventually faded away.  We decided to keep walking while keeping our eyes on it but we eventually lost sight.  Then a couple minutes later we saw the same thing a few miles over.  As we were walking further down the road we saw the same thing again even further over, again.   We never saw two of these formations at once so we can't say how many there actually were, but we did see a formation in various, distinctly different spots within a very short amount of time.  We then decided to go get some food.   We were in there for about half an hour to forty-five minutes and when we came out, we saw another two-light formation over the parking lot.   We watched it for about a minute before going to the other side of the plaza, which obscured our view. The store we were meaning to go to was closed, though, so we headed back around.   By the time we got back, the lights had completely vanished. It only took about a minute and a half. The last formation we saw was another two! -lighter over the bay before we went in the house.  The lights did not blink like most aircraft; sometimes they did not even move--just hovered, stationary, above the city in a perfect triangle. There seemed to always be a main ""tip"" of the triangle that the whole formation rotated around. This one was always the brightest.",2012-01-12T00:00:00,37.918,-122.3032

We had started late, around 10:15 and my two smallest sons slept in my truck while my fiancee, my oldest son 16 and I worked for 2 hours setting things up. Around 11:15 to 11:30 I started getting the feeling we were being watched…I kept my eyes open  and kept scanning the shadows (without making it obvious) while putting things on the tables.  It may very well have been individuals watching since it is a “shady” area and the building’s surroundings were robbed the night before.  Nonetheless, I was alert but did not see anything. About that time my son accidentally kicked a leg out from one of the tables.  I shook my head and made the long trek around the line of tables to get the leg on the other side.   The whole time my son watched me because he thought he was in trouble.  I picked up the leg and proceeded to walk a few additional steps to my fiancee to hand him the leg (he did not hear it break).  Upon reaching him I looked in the sky at a bright light, back at him, then immediately looked back up to take a double shot…at the same time, my son followed my gaze and within 10 seconds we both exclaimed in unison “What was that! Oh my God…What was that” and looked at each other in disbelief. We both were covered in goose bumps from that moment on and for about 20 min after.  Upon talking on the way home we both were still in disbelief and kept getting goose bumps talking about it. We both seen the same thing.  It was a large bright …super bright sphere.  This light was brighter than LED lights, yet it did not illuminate (or radiate) the light outwards.  It was as if the light was self contained….There was not even a hazy glow around it like you would imagine a light to be…it was as if a child drew a picture of a black sky and placed a white/yellow light in the center.  The  light hovered and did not move for about 4 seconds when we looked at it. Then all of a sudden it shot off to the west and  it went so fast that it looked not like a streak, but like a small line of light (like a segment in the sky).  The first part of the segment was as bright as the object  the second half of the segment was half as bright.  Then there was no more. No sound, no light, no streak, no smoke, no nothing.  It was fairly close to the highway.  As far as distance up, the best way I can describe it is… Imaging a search helicopter then imagine a large commercial airplane w! here you barely see the blinking lights, now draw an imaginary line, and put the sphere of light about ¼ up from the helicopter. My fiancee stayed and worked on putting the stuff out for our sale the rest of the night.  I called a few times and talked to him and he had not seen anything.  He is a bit bummed out since he loves watching UFO documentaries and is into it and my son and I don’t really think much about it.  I don’t think anything about these things.  When I was a child we were in Spokane Washington and within 1 week I witnessed 2 UFOs. 1 was a craft and 1 was a disk in a field (it was faster than our car).  As a young woman I used to have nightmare about being on a table and having aliens surround me and I can’t move or scream…just cry.  (Where those came from, I don’t know…)  I don’t talk about these things or even think about them. I love watching the stars and catching a glimpse of a falling star or meteor shower, but I have never had any other sighting since I was a small child.  I don’t watch horror movies and don’t have an over active imagination.  I guess I would like to be able to give my son a reasonable explanation for what we seen.  Thank you.",2011-08-07T00:00:00,,

We hid and watched, waiting for it to pass.   At first we thought it was a helicopter due to its slow movement, but it was nearly silent.  We thought it was looking for us because of how slowly it moved forward, and how low it was to the ground. It was in a dark triangle shape, with white lights at the ends, and a red light in the center.  I believe it had a metallic pattern on the underbelly.  The white and red lights blinked intermittently.  It took around two minutes for it to pass us and go behind the trees and when it did, we got to a higher elevation and could still see it (very low to the ground). It didn't move in an exact straight line, it slowly and steadily turned and turned back to keep forward.  About 25 minutes later, another similar aircraft passed by in the same direction, slightly faster I think and this time it was silent.

We had just watched some small fireworks from people about 100 yards up the beach and remained on our blanket to look at the stars.  It was a clear night.  We were facing the ocean and lying down.   We gazed at the stars and talked as a few people walked by but we were eventually alone.  Other fireworks were seen about a mile up the beach (north).   After about 30 minutes I decided it was time to return to the beach house.  My son sat up first and when he turned around he immediately exclaimed about what he saw in the sky behind and to the left of us over land.   I sat up, turned, and was startled to see a large orange glowing orb (far larger than any aircraft relative to were it appeared--smaller, about half the size of  a full moon).  It was about 50 degrees above the horizon and probably under but close to 500 feet in altitude..  It appeared to moving toward us at first but was actually moving away (north) from us.    We watched it move slowly and smoothly in a straight line for almost 2 minutes before it disappeared into either isolated cloud cover or possibly the haze of Myrtle Beach lights many miles north.  My son was a little worried but I remained calm and explained that it was simply ""unidentified"", and what that meant.    We talked about  what it could have been and another minute later I turned around (from the ocean facing inland) and it was there again but directly behind us and closer.  We both saw it.  It was clearly visible and seemingly a brightly glowing gaseous orange orb with a faint red outer tinge.  My son said, ""It looks like fire and gas""  It was unlike ANYTHING I’d ever seen in the sky before   This time I was uneasy because it was quite ominous and eerie so when my little boy said, ""I think we should get out of here, Mom, let’s go""  I stood up grabbed the blanket without shaking off the sand, and we quickly left, still watching it as we walked up and over the board walk.  (About 2 minutes time again that we viewed  the object).   On the golf cart ride back to the beach house, I remarked that no one was going to believe us.  We returned to the house and told all family members.  My son described  the object the same as I would have as ""orange and round and -on top what looked like a red cap"".

I was using my telescope and looking south I saw flashes of light, much like lightning, and thought there was a fire or maybe explosions.  Then one of us noticed the light, I pointed my telescope at it and it was a teardrop shape with many colors: blue, yellow, green, red and orange.   It appeared that there were missiles being shot at it, about nine at a time, and the light would evade the missiles and hover again.  There were about five volleys of missiles shot.  There was the sound of jet craft coming from the north.  They were hiding in the mountains so that they could not be seen but we could hear them.  There were three distinct squadrons of jets that went to intercept the craft.  They went by about five minutes apart. Eventually we saw the light start to dodge the jets; they had finally appeared some 80 miles, a guess, away.  The light finally went behind the mountains and away from view.   We watched the squadron follow the craft and a few minutes later we saw a cigar shaped light descend from the sky and start to follow the jets to the west until it too disappeared behind the mountains.

On 2/17/12 a Massive burning flash turned into a triangular ship in Newburgh NY.,Newburgh,NY,2012-02-17T23:00:00,triangle,5 minutes,"Occurred : 2/17/2012 23:00  (Entered as : 02/17/12 23:00) Reported: 3/10/2012 4:11:24 AM 04:11 Posted: 3/13/2012 Location: Newburgh, NY Shape: Triangle Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87567.html,"On 2/17/12 a Massive burning flash turned into a triangular ship in Newburgh NY. First I would like to start off by saying that this is not a hoax or a joke. I do not want to waste my time nor your time. I live in Newburgh NY. I have believed that there was some kind of life beyond this world but never looked in the sky or anything like that. Newburgh has a ufo problem. Whether alien or military there are abnormal crafts in the sky and i have the videos to prove so. Here is my story. 3 weeks prior to the major sighting I was driving home from Planet Fitness in Newburgh Ny around 7:00 pm toward my girlfriends house who lives in Plattekill NY. Plattekill is only a couple of minutes away from Newburgh. So im driving and i see a burnt orange light in the sky. I remember saying to myself wow thats a weird color star. As I am driving I cant help but still look at it. I noticed there was like what looked to be glitter falling from this star. The glitter stops and then the star starts to rock back and forth like a cradle. It does it very slowly and then it just fades out. I pull over and then i cant see anything. That was the first time i ever saw anything weird. 3 weeks later it is 2/17/12 and me and my girlfriend are coming from Poughkeepsie NY driving down 84 east heading towards Newburgh NY. We are driving on interstate 84 when me and my girlfriend notice a burnt orange thing hovering in the sky. You could tell it was a craft but u couldnt make out what it looked like. We just dismissed it as a plane and kept on driving. We kept driving and got to the Beacon Bridge which connects you from Poughkeepsie to Newburgh. Thats when we saw the craziest thing that i have ever seen in my life. We saw a craft flying and then all of a sudden a huge burnt orange flash. I mean this flash was huge. So big i slammed on my brake and pulled over on a bridge.  I thought that a plane had exploded and i was ready to dial 911. I go to grab my phone and then realize that noone else was stopping. No sirens....no ambulances....no nothing.  We are standing outside looking around trying to see if we see any thing and all we see is the same craft continue to fly off into the night.  I thought it was so weird how this craft look like it exploded and then all of a sudden it flies away unscathed. We get back in the car to see if we can follow this thing but it went off way to high.  So right now me and my girlfriend are stunned. I cant believe i just saw something blow up and then fly away like nothing happened.  We sit back and think to ourselves well where did we see the huge flash of light at and we determined it to be right over Torches on the waterfront in newburgh.  This waterfront ha! s a whole bunch of restaurants but it doesnt open until the weather gets warmer up here so very few cars were there.  We then said lets go down and see if maybe some stuff dropped on the ground. So we go down and park.  We see nothing no marks or anything. I take out my camera and start looking into the sky. Nothing.  We stayed for about 15 minutes and still nothing.  So then i said forget it and lets leave. We turn around and then i felt sonmething.  I cant explain what i felt but something told me to turn around one last time.  Thats when it happened. I have to start off by saying it was the MOST BEAUTIFUL THING I HAVE EVER SEEN.  It was a light that I swear could pierce right through your soul.  A huge flash of light like the sun was breaking the night beamed from beneath the clouds.  It was so bright and wide. I couldnt move or speak.  i just stood there......amazed.  This big flash stayed in the sky and then started to get smaller.  The brightness of the flash never left but it got smaller. at first I thought it started shrinking but then i realized it wasnt shrinking but it was moving this way. I grabbed my camera off my neck and started recording. This light became a ball of light and it was moving slowly over the water from Poughkeepsie and into Newburgh.  Me and my girlfriend are standing in the Torches parking lot.  This light is still moving and then it starts to split into two lights.  It split kind of like when cells do under a microscope or something like that. Now its two lights but they lights are not split. the two lights are side my side to each other. The two lights then turn to 3.  The third light appears on top the two lights like a triangle. You can see that it in the first video.  The videos are shaky in the beginning because i couldnt capture it.  It was so weird. With our eyes it was moving slow but on camera it was so fast that i had to constantly keep focusing in and out on it. In the other videos you can see more lights appear. I am still recording this thing come over the water and then it starts to get really close.  And so now its half way over the water and there is like 6 or 7 lights around this thing.  Whatever it was was completely flat. Its moving so slow and then i start to realize that it was way bigger than i thought it would be.  This craft had to be about 150 feet in the air.  Which i thought was real unusual since you dont see airplanes that close. The craziest thing about this ship was that it was so quiet. I have seen smaller planes that that thing make noise and be further away. So it didnt make any sense. Now this ship is coming over us and thats when i seen that my amazement turned to fear. This was not American made. I tried recording it but for some reason it would not show up. It was 11:00 pm and it was very dark outside so i know that didnt help. Whoever is reading this please understand that what i am about to tell you is 100% what me and my girlfriend saw and ill take a lie detector test to prove so. The ship was in the shape of a triangle like a pizza slice. One corner was red, the other was blue and the tip was orange. In the middle of it was about 5 to 6 huge orange lights. This ship made no noise and was flying but flying so slow. It was black or maybe even a dark gray. It was very wide. The lights were the most amazing part. because it was so bright. I couldnt see any writings or lettering on the ship. It then pasts us and starts to tilt into the sky. So basically from the time it left Poughkeepsie and got to us it seemed to be flying straight. But once it passed it and it started to tilt into the sky. It was still moving slow and flew until we couldnt see it anymore. Right off into the stars. My girlfriend can recant the whole story word for word. I turned around to look at her and she looked as though she saw a ghost. Everything was fun until it passed us. I always thought it would be cool to come in contact with a ufo but it didnt feel so. i felt terrified. That ! thing was massive. It was so silent. I couldnt believe noone seen anything. We were the only ones on that dock. Please listen to this. I dont know who you are or what you do. I am taking alot of risks by writing this to you but it needs to be told. Something or Someone is hiding something here. Because since then i continually see these bright orange lights. i see these lights rocks back and forth and some fade and then others come back. I have seen these lights make triangles and then dismember themselves. I dont know what you guys can do or what you guys will do. But i am telling you this is no hoax. after i typed in google ufo by beacon bridge ny and saw some amazing stuff. it was a forum called MUFON. I had posted my story and then someone commented and told me to write this. I am not looking for fame or money. I want answers. Because this stuff is real and scary and i see on the news all the time about other places seeing the kind of things i saw. As of late they have been happening more and more than ever before. i feel as though something apocalyptic is going to happe and happen soon. Please respond to this. i know contact is not feasible but if you are serious my post is on the http://forums.mufon.com/index.cgi?board=general&action=display&thread=350. I refuse to let my story be swept under the rug i am not crazy nor delusional. i am a graduate of 4 year university with a great job and a wonderful girlfriend and an amazing family. I am a ordinary person and a couple of ! months ago i would have laughed in someones face if they told me I would do this. I know what we saw.....I dont want the joke to be on us. Thank you for your time. I will be sending a video titled the 17th of February Sight.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,41.5303904347826,-74.04801391304348

On Saturday, September 24, 2011 we had family arrive in town for their vacation.  That night we all went down to Downtown Disney to shop, eat, and have a good time.  Our evening was cut short by one of the worst lightning storms I have ever seen.  I have only lived in Florida just over a year but I am accustomed to Florida’s storms and how fast they can come on, so we hustled our group back to our cars expecting a bad thunderstorm. Our group consisted of me 35, my husband 40, my Aunt 56, 2 female cousins 32 and 28, my 2 daughters 12 and 8, my cousins’ children 17, 13, 10, 8, 5 & 5. We divided this group of 13 between a minivan and my car.   As we leave, and are safely in our vehicles, we see a bolt of lightning in the distance that was so strong and bright that my husband and I joke, ""That’s some War of the Worlds lightning!"" referring to the sci-fi moving about extra-terrestrials starring Tom Cruise.  It did not rain on us though, just more lightning and wind. My cousin, who was driving the minivan, with my Aunt, and a bunch of the kids, decides she will follow us because she does not know the way back to our place and it will be easier for her.  We take the Champion’s Gate exit and turn onto Ronald Reagan Pkwy, as we are at the first light we see something hovering low in the air that is disc shaped with a domed top and some sort of panel type lights that are white and sort of blink in a rapid, circular/rotational, succession around the dome giving the feeling of animated movement (think carnival lights, but bright and not colorful and of course large, that is the only thing I can think of for the movement).  This object was so low and bright, completely still and something to look at, I immediately thought that this was some sort of attraction which is typical in Central Florida.  I yell to my husband and kids, and my cousin, ""What is that? A blimp?!  What is that?!”""  We are all looking and cannot believe our eyes!  This thing was hovering, not tethered and no one was around. It became clear this was not an attraction of any sort.  I felt like I was going to throw up. I could not believe what we were seeing!  Instead of taking a pic on my cell phone (I could kick myself now) I hurriedly call the cell phone of my cousin who was in the minivan immediately behind us at the light. I scream into the phone, ""Oh my god!  Do you see…""  and before I can get it out my Aunt yells back, ""What is that?!  Oh my gosh!""   We are all in an uproar in both vehicles, staring in disbelief and trying to come to grips with what we are seeing.  The object slowly hovers a short distance as we continue to stare and try to make sense of what we are seeing and burn it into our memory, then ZOOM the object moves (to the southwest)away faster than I have ever seen anything move. We proceed through the light trying to keep it in our sight. We can see by the band of lights (which windows immediately struck me, not sure why) that this thing banked hard like a saucer of in the distance, because the band of lights appeared diagonal in the sky.  Next thing we know it was out of sight. Please keep in mind that this all happened within the time span of a red traffic signal, seconds or a minute at most and the few seconds after that it remained in our line of sight.  I know this sounds unbelievable. We called my other cousin and her husband, who live only 3 miles from where we were and less than a quarter mile from my home, and told them what we saw.  We were all freaking out! She and her husband immediately go out and scan the skies and tell us they see nothing but a few helicopters or planes (I’m sorry I don’t remember which she said) with search lights on. As we drove home, about 1/8th mile from the sighting 2 police or sheriffs cars were parked on the side of the street facing out towards the street (taking a break or talking, I thought).  We wondered if they had seen anything.   Every one of us including the littlest experienced this together. We talked about it the rest of the night and how we will never forget this.  However, how do you convince yourself what you saw was real?  I know what I saw and  it was amazing and unexplainable, yet my mind keeps telling me I am crazy and I keep asking everyone are you sure we actually saw that?  Of course I know we did. It was so close and too real to deny it.  This happened to us, and I don’t know why but I feel like maybe I have gone a little insane or that something is wrong with us all.  How can we believe our own eyes?   I must admit that I am surprised by this reaction in myself, because I always said that I believe in UFO sightings but when I see one with my own eyes I cannot believe it.  Please tell me I am not crazy! 13 people don’t just see the same unexplained thing!   I searched for any UFO sightings in FL on the internet that night.  Found nothing specific.  This is not a hoax and I am not a flaky person (neither is my family). I cannot tell you if anyone besides my family in our 2 separate cars saw this at that intersection.  All of ours eyes were upward and with all of the freaking out I must say that I was not looking at much else.  Plus my husband was driving, and as he proceeded through the light and on the rest of our trip home, we all still continued to watch the sky and talk excitedly so I didn’t pay much attention to our other surroundings.  I wish one of us would have taken a picture and I wish I would have noticed if there was anyone else at that light who could confirm this.  We were for lack of a better word, stupefied.

So then we assumed it was a tower of some sort but the bigger white light still didn’t blink like most tower light do and have to because they are so high in the sky.  We got closer and it got brighter and larger.  As we rounded the bend and started to enter into Zanesville it was right there above a field and some houses on the West Bound side on 70.  What we had initially thought was one large white star, then a white tower light with one red smaller light, ended up being a triangle shaped object with 3 large separate white lights and two red lights on the back end points of the object. It was still very still, almost hovering over this area of fields and houses.  I wanted to pull off to the side but with the rate of speed I was going and there were cars right behind me I couldn’t get over in time.  The first exit into Zanesville was just around the right bend. We hurried off of the exit, then headed back west on 40 which runs parallel to 70 to the area that we saw this craft. We drove the road to the area and it wasn’t there. It was so big and so slow that it should have still been there. But it was gone. It just vanished.

The date was November 19th, 2011. The place was Alma, Wisconsin in Buffalo County along the Mississippi River. I was waiting for it to become light and passed the time by looking up into the clear dark sky to watch the stars and perhaps catch a few shooting stars. I was sitting facing North, looking a bit west. I was pleased to see two shooting stars within a minute of each other and then watched as a Satellite crossed the sky from my right to left or East to West. I was looking Northwest about 11:00 high at the time.  I just had glanced at my watch which indicated 6:05am when I thought I saw another Satellite coming again from the East at the same spot as the other Satellite.  At about half way across my line of sight the object suddenly stopped. Something I never saw before.  Then the object began a pattern of what appeared to be a series of 45 degree turns.  Each time the change of direction was sharp followed by an impossibly fast acceleration and sudden stop.  The distance traveled each time was consistent. It then settled into a clockwise pattern repeating the angles and advance as before. The object became dim and then bright leading me to believe it was getting further away and the closer as it circled.  Next it did the original pattern again of different directions before once a! gain, settling into the clockwise pattern.  I was afraid to take my eyes off the object in fear that I would lose sight of it. I also was aware that it was becoming light and that has dawn was approaching I would soon not be able to witness the event anymore. The object was still visible as more and more stars faded out.  I noted that there were 4 bright stars that the object was centered in the middle of, that were the last to fade. These formed a trapezoid around the object. At shortly after 6:20 the sky became too light to see any stars including the strange object I witnessed dancing in the morning sky. Later in the afternoon when I met up with the rest of our hunting party, I told them of my encounter. They were skeptical and were even making jokes when my 20 year old nephew chimed in and said he saw the same UFO that morning but was afraid to say anything. I saw something similar when I was about 15 years old with friends, but over time decided it must have been our imaginations. I am now 51 and it was not my imagination that recent opening morning of Deer Hunting! I believe we have the ability to track most anything that comes close to earth and this would be no exception. I personally believe this may have been something our own government knows about or is testing high up in our atmosphere.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,44.33768,-91.84722

My house faces North and the object was traveling very slowly primarily towards the East and moving away from me in a slightly Northward direction.  It was low; about the altitude you would see a helicopter or small engine plane. The best way to describe it is that it appeared the object was on fire (bright orangish-red) on the top surface in a dome shape and the glow extended very slightly downward.  It also appeared that the bright lights extended towards the front and the rear but in more of a pointed shape.   It was visible to me for about 2 or so minutes until it slowly faded out as it moved away from me.  It never seemed to change speeds and never seemed to change altitude. I usually do not do this (i.e. send out this type of thing), but I was very intrigued by it.  After checking this website, I read someone else’s account (Greer 11/8/11) and it sounds almost exactly like what I saw tonight so I decided to send this in.

At 9:10 pm on july 22nd 2011, two associates and myself observed what looked like a satellite in the northeast sky traveling north.  It looked the same shape, size and brightness as the surronding stars.  As it approached near perfect north in the sky a small very bright light zipped right in front of it, almost like a rocket.  Then the lights just dissapeared.  We were shocked and amazed at what we witnessed.   Then near the same place where we saw the 1st light dissapear we saw another star like object appear and start to glow extreamly bright.  Then it got dimmer;about as bright as the surronding stars, and started to travel towards the same path as the first light had taken.  Only in the opposite direction.   When it had gotten about true east it vanished from view getting slightly dimmer througout its entire path starting from its bright beginning.   Within a minute or two after, another object appeared where the second had appeared. It too presented with a bright light which drew our attention and followed the exact path as the previous light.  As if it was following the light before it.   Throughout the next 20 minutes or so we were treated to at least 5 or 6 more of the same lights appearing with a flash and traveling through the sky.  Although to and from many different directions.   After a 5 minute period of rest in the sky I told the fellows we had to get back to work.  By 21:45 it was all over.

The object had a light blue color to it and was very bright.   I looked at the object, which was stationary, for about 4-5 seconds.  Just then, the object made a sharp, fast movement to the right of viewing traveling about three or four inches in my scale of the sky view. It then rapidly decelerated, and continued to travel, this time at a slower pace, to the right where it disappeared behind the clouds.  The light had an approximate height of 45 degrees from the ground.   Visibility shaken, we both asked each other if we saw what we thought we saw. We continued along the highway, but were not again able to identify the object. When we returned home, we immediately turned to the internet in an attempt to see if anyone else had seen the object.

It was very different than witnessing a typical ""shooting star"" as the light was a red orange, quite fiery looking, and rather than blinking out of existence it first exploded quite clearly. I can say for sure this was not a fireworks display, as it all happened in utter silence and with no surrounding exploding debris.

We pulled over to watch it as it appeared to suddenly move faster and it apeared to change colors.. the hue would flash a faint green or purple. After stopping to eat to pick up food and go home, we checked outside our door a few tiems.. it still seemed to hover but was further away,, say 100-200 miles at that point.. like a pin drop in the sky.

We parked, went into our friends house.. she stated that her friend had left late because her car battery had died and she needed a new one. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus, we suspect.

Maybe it was just a meteor but it was the largest light in the sky, other than the sun, the moon or fireworks, that I've ever seen.  On Sunday (9/25/11) at approximately 11:40 P.M.  I was out on my porch and I saw a large light move across the sky.  I only saw it for about 2 seconds before it disappeared behind some nearby trees.  I watched to see it reappear on the other side of the trees, and saw it for an instant through the trees, but before it could reappear there was a flash in the sky.  The flash wasn't overly dramatic, but easily discernable and originated behind the trees where the light had been.   I'm assuming it exploded or burned up or something at that time because it never did reappear. I live in Phillips, Maine and from my location the light, which was a yellowish white, was moving from north to south in the western sky.  I would guess that it was about 30 to 35 degrees up from the horizon - so not too high in the sky.  The size of the light was the thing that caught my eye. It was large, I would estimate that it was larger than 1/3 and smaller than 1/2 the diameter of the moon.  Another way to describe it would be if I were to draw on a piece of paper how big an average meteor looked I would draw something maybe 1/16 to 1/8 inch in diameter.

It’s been almost two weeks now and I haven’t heard anything back from anyone.

I was on the phone with my husband who was at work when our 2 year old daughter wanted to see the moon. I walked out on the front steps of our mobile home while holding her.  I then did a 360 degree turn to see if we could find the moon.  We saw nothing, not even stars.  As I faced my front door again (due SE) a blink in the sky caught my eye and I looked up. At first there was only a white light that I assumed was a star.  Then I saw several red lights flash in a circle around the white light in sequence.  Within maybe 2-3 seconds between 7 and 11 more white lights reappeared and disappeared randomly on and off for at least 7 minutes.  Whilst that was going on, I focused once more on the initial (and significantly brighter) white light.  It started jerking in different directions ( not very far at all in any one direction) then randomly moving smoothly in another direction. Occasionally it would seem to ""throw off sparks"" in different directions or have a tail (like a comet but much shorter). While all of this is going on my daughter says ""Mommy, see stars?"" and points at all of them. At this point the large grouping of lights fade out one by one in no specific order. She says ""Stars go bye-bye?"" I replied, ""Yes baby."" At this point I know damn good and well we are not witnessing any natural bodies, nor are we looking at known military aircraft as I held a top-secret security status in the USAF. I look at the main light and now it seems to be getting closer then farther away growing larger and brighter as it gets closer and dimmer and smaller as it gets farther away, sometimes blinking out completely. It is still moving in many different directions at this point. I stayed on the phone with my husband the entire time we were outside, describing every detail to him wondering his opinion since he was in the US Army and just recently got out. I started to get nervous so I took my daughter inside and we decided to look out the back door and see if we could see the moon but the sky was empty again. I then tucked her in her bed. My husband and I were curious as to whether they would come back so I stepped back onto the front steps and looked in the same spot the main light had been and nothing was there. Just as I went to turn my head away I saw what looked like many tiny strobe lights going off then the larger white light slowly reappeared and seemed to get closer as it did so. (At this point I got off the phone with my husband.) It then seemed as though the larger light was throwing off sparks again. The ""strobes"" slowed down and occasionally flashed in different spots and different distances from the main light. The main light disappeared and reappeared probably 5 or 6 times the got the largest and brightest it had been during this whole show. It was perfectly still for several seconds, then seemed to draw a complete perfect circle, then sat still again for a couple seconds. It then started to slowly fade away and the ""strobes"" started to flash again but seemed even smaller before and now there were several red ones mixed in. They faded from site at precisely  the same exact second the large light disappeared. I stood there for several moment waiting to see if they would come back but they didn't, so I came back in the house.

Hello,  My wife and I live in McKeesport, PA.  This morning, at approximately 11:15--11:20 A.M., we were driving north on Myer Blvd. in McKeesport.  I stopped at the stop sign at the intersection of Myer and Riverview and my eye was immediately drawn to a bright light visible in the sky directly ahead of me above the northern horizon.  I saw that the light was reflecting from a metallic silver object, and I thought it was odd because it seemed so much brighter than the jets or planes I've seen before in the sky.  My instant reaction was to think this was a conventional aircraft of some kind, and I watched it, thinking that in a second or two a wing structure would become visible as the craft moved toward the north-east.  When no wing structure appeared after a few seconds, I called my wife's attention to the object.  She immediately saw it at that point and was as puzzled by it as I was. The object appeared to be cigar shaped. It was metallic and silvery looking.  There were no wings, propellers, lights, or markings visible anywhere on it.  The object left no contrail, nor could we hear any sound coming from it (although a sound would have been hard to hear because our car's engine was running and our windows were not rolled down.)   In the center of the aircraft appeared what looked like a series of rectangular windows. (My wife said she didn't see this feature.) It was moving in a slightly north-easterly direction at about the same speed as a conventional aircraft would move.   With growing curiosity, I turned the car left and drove up Riverview in order to track the object and keep it in sight. We watched it head into the north-east for a while, and then it suddenly vanished.  I don't know if it flew behind the clouds.  We suddenly were unable to find it in the sky.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,40.327574285714284,-79.83367928571428

I was by myself at the time.  The weather was clear.  I noticed through my sliding door a very bright object in the sky, toward the east.  The angle of elevation from my viewpoint was probably about 45 degrees.  The big lights were white, but it also had a few blinking red lights, not the normal red and green lights you would see on the wings of a commercial airplane.  I am accustomed to seeing planes in the night sky as we are on a path toward the DC airports.  This was much lower than the planes normally fly and was traveling roughly north to south rather than the normal south to north-flying planes we are accustomed to seeing at night heading toward the airports.  My first thought was that it must be a helicopter with searchlights and I wondered for whom or what they might be searching.  There was another plane in the area when I noticed the object, but it was m! uch higher and appeared to be just a plane on its normal route toward the airport. As I continued to watch it, the object moved very slowly in a southerly direction.  I noticed that the extremely bright lights were not aimed at the ground as if it were a search helicopter.  It moved behind the trees in back of my house.  I thought it was strange, but figured I’d seen the last of it so I went and sat down.  From my chair where I was watching TV I can see that same section of the sky. Maybe 5 or 10 minutes later, I saw what I assume was the same object traveling back this way, south to north.  As it got closer, it slowly turned and moved toward my house, just over the power lines.  When it turned toward me I could see that it was very large and had 3 huge, round white lights spaced widely and evenly across the front.  I could see for certain by now that it was not a helicopter.  Plus, we see and hear plenty of helicopters here due to our proximity to the Quantico Marine Corps Base and other military installations.  I am very familiar with the loud sound! of a helicopter going by.  As it approached, I began to hear that it was only making a low sound. I walked out onto my back porch and watched as it got closer and closer.  It appeared to be getting lower toward the ground.  For some reason, I wasn’t afraid that it was going to crash, I assume because I could tell how slowly it was moving and it seemed to be under control.  It was simply mesmerizing and I was transfixed watching it.  I was frustrated that I was home alone and couldn’t yell for someone to come see what I was seeing.  As I watched, it glided by very slowly and rather quietly, but not silently, almost overhead.  From my porch, it appeared to pass about 30-50 feet to the south of me.  I would compare the sound and movement to a boat with a trolling motor, only flying, or the sound somewhat like a lawnmower in the distance.  It certainly wasn’t the sound of a normal plane engine, which would have been rather deafening at that close range.  I am not familiar with a plane that can fly that quietly and slowly or with the configuration of the 3 huge lights. As it passed by, the intensity of the lights was no longer interfering with my view of the object.  I was looking at it from underneath so I could make out the shape, probably aided by the small streetlight that is almost below where it passed.  It was dark and appeared to be somewhat of a boomerang shape.  There were no lights on the underneath side.  If I were to compare it to a full moon, I’d estimate that from side to side it would be larger than 10 or 12 moons.  It’s difficult to say at night, but I’d guess it was about 200 feet above the ground.  From the time it first came into view from underneath until it went over the trees was about 10 seconds.  I could still see it through the small stand of trees beside my house, but I didn’t have an unobstructed view any more.  It was like standing on the runway if a 747 could glide quietly in for a landing, except it wasn’t shaped like a commercial airplane.  It was quite large. It continued gliding across the road in front of my house, and across the field as it curved toward the south and disappeared beyond the trees.  A little while later, maybe 15 or 20 minutes, one of my sons came home and I told him what I had seen.  Within about another 20 minutes, I saw bright lights again traveling from north to south, similar to where I had seen them the first time.  At this point, my son looked out and saw the object and commented on how bright and low it was.  He watched until it disappeared behind the trees in our yard.  Typical of his not wanting to appear too excited and since he hadn’t witnessed what I had seen before, he went back into the kitchen, but I walked out behind my house so I could see behind the trees and watched as it moved south.  It never disappeared from sight, but eventually I determined that it was moving closer again and a little higher in the sky.  Oddly, the appearance of the lights didn’t change like it had turned around – ! more like it was backing up.  The bright lights were no longer visible.  It came back the way it went, behind my house, higher this time and moving more quickly, but with no white lights on the front, just the red flashing lights on the body.  I watched as it flew north and out of sight.  That was the last I saw of it. There are several rows of high-tension power lines behind my house, running somewhat north and south.  It was over these at some points, but didn’t necessarily follow the lines, especially when it headed south – the lines run a little more south-west and it traveled a little more south-east.  And, of course, when it turned and came toward me and continued in a slow circle to the south it wasn’t over the lines.  Other than my son, who just got a brief look at the object when it was more in the distance, I’m not aware of any other witnesses, although I don’t know how anyone out at that time could have missed it if it passed near them as low and slow as it was here. This is the second time I have seen something unusual behind my house.  The first time was a night almost two years ago and involved something large with only red lights, some blinking and some steady, descending into view through my back door then quickly flipping one end downward and rapidly descending out of sight behind the small hill in my back yard, at about a 45 – 50 degree angle, into the trees or the creek.  That whole incident lasted only maybe 5 or 10 seconds.  My first thought was that a plane had caught a wing on the power line and gone down.  My husband and I ran outside but never saw anything more.  From where he was sitting, he didn’t see the lights but followed me out based on my reaction of shock.  As I thought about it, I realized it didn’t have any white lights like a plane or helicopter would normally have at night and there was no loud noise as a plane or helicopter would have made at that distance. I’ve lived in this house for 24 years and have seen plenty of planes and helicopters out the back door and windows, as that is where my den is and my chair faces toward that direction.  These two incidents were definitely unusual.  I know what they weren’t – weather balloons, swamp gas, ball lightning… but I’d certainly like to know what they were.  If the large object that nearly flew over my house is military and it’s ours, then good for us.  I don’t know why they would test fly it low over a housing development in Northern Virginia, though.  Very puzzling.  I can’t say that what I saw was an extra-terrestrial UFO, but it was F. and it was an O. and it was definitely U. to me.  If someone can give me a plausible explanation that would be great because no one with whom I’ve spoken has been able to come up with one. This is the statement from my son:  On the night of November 19, 2011 I came home around 11:00 pm and saw my Mom standing on the back deck looking up into the sky.  She explained to me that she had just been watching a large aircraft that had been slowly moving through the sky at a low altitude, with a strange light pattern that didn’t resemble an airplane.  Because we live near Quantico, I said it could have been one of their planes and went inside.  About 20 minutes later, she said she saw it outside again so we walked out onto the back porch and saw a much brighter than normal aircraft flying just over the tree line, heading south.  It was moving slower than the airplanes that we frequently see.  The lights on it didn’t resemble the lights on a normal airplane.  It had extremely large front white lights that didn’t shoot a beam forward like headlights, but lit up a large area around the front of the aircraft.  It seemed to be very large, bigger than a regular jet airplane, which we often see flying behind our house. The aircraft continued along the tree line from our vantage point until I could no longer see it through the trees from the porch.  I thought it was gone, so I walked back into the house, but my Mom walked back up onto the hill to see if she could get a better look at it.  I have seen airplanes fly over the house my entire life since we are on one of the flight paths for Washington airports and we live near Quantico.  This didn’t resemble any passenger jet or any other aircraft I’ve seen over the years.  When passenger jets, helicopters and military aircraft fly over, they make a clearly audible sound.  During the time I observed the aircraft, I didn’t hear any sound coming from it.  I’m curious to know what it was.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,38.44397520661157,-77.42208057851239

I was driving and peered under the top right section of the windshield and saw a large yellow sphere moving parallel to the car then moved very quickly in front and finally disappearing in front of the car.   This all took about 5 secs.   The yellow, slightly greenish sphere was fully illuminated and appeared like a huge falling star or giant fireball.   As it passed our car, the glowing appeared more in front of the sphere like only the semi-circle was lit.   Then when it was fully in the front windshied, only red lights were visible, which made me think it was a plane, but it disappeared in a cloudless night.  If it wasn't for the huge fireball like appearance, I would have thought it was a plane.  The relative size of! the vision was about two times the size of a full moon.

It began as a feeling of something approaching my bedroom and I thought that it was the family cat making his way to my bedroom. The house has hardwood floors and that makes it easy to hear footfalls approaching the room you’re in. The footfalls were very light and faint and that’s what made me think they were from the cat. The next thing I know the “cat” was on my bed and I could feel it next to my head. I thought it was strange that the cat was able to jump up onto the bed and get to the far side of my head with out me noticing him walking over there. The “cat which I will now call the ENTITY because I later believed that this is more closely a description of what was interacting with me. I tried to reach up with my hand and pet the “cat” but I could not feel him there . Next I felt him on my thighs and again I thought it strange that he could travel down to my legs without me noticing him walking down there. Once I felt him on my thighs I reached down to pet him again and once more he was not there , I could not feel him. The room was dark and I was underneath a down comforter and a light quilt as the event continued. My whole body was now underneath the covers and my hands were laying on my chest, my body laid out straight , and I was lying on my back, eyes open. The next thing I realize is a feeling of strange energy-like infused foggy mist forming above my bed. The darkness in the room was being lit up slightly by this energized fog. In my mind I felt a very weird feeling of confusion and a feeling of something taking over my thoughts in some strange way. I should say that words can’t accurately describe what exactly was going on inside my mind, so the reader of this should just bear with me on this description. The thoughts of the “cat” being on me was something I feel was a foreign thought being put in my mind to make me feel ok with what was going on. Again words can’t describe this feeling, I felt confused but not scared…YET. The very next thing that happened was a feeling of being stood up against a wall that had a depression in it the exact width of my body, with my hands at my side. This wall looked like wood grained paneling and my face was just a fraction of an inch away from touching it. The next feeling was that of motion. This motion was like the wall gave way and my whole body was moving forward into this wall, I was still standing as I moved into the wall. The motion continued forward then either up or down or I really cant say which way I was headed. The motion stopped and I felt like I was still in my bedroom though. The room I was in looked just like my bedroom, but I think that’s because this thought was being placed into my mind. The next thing I see is an object that looked like an elongated cell phone with a touch screen face on it. This object was about eight inches long and the width was about 2 inches across. The screen of this object was lit and had something like letters or symbols scrolling across it . The vision of this object was so clear and real to me that I began to really wonder what the hell was it doing floating above me . this device was floating above my left side  perpendicular to the bed surface facing to my right side. I then noticed that it was streaming a strange light up over my body to a point up on the wall to my right about a foot from the ceiling. Now this really puzzeled me and that’s when I began to feel panicked. It was right then that I felt that this was really happening and It was impossible that this could be going on. I then felt that I should try to grab this device and make it stop scanning me. I could not move a muscle, I found my whole body paralyzed, the onl! y way I was seeing this take place was through my eyes that could not move either. I could only see what was in my field of vision all the way out to my peripheral limits.This was enough to see the whole room wall to wall. I was very scared to find myself paralyzed with this device traveling the length of my body up and down . I decided to scream and see if that at least made my mother hear me and come rescue me from this madness. I tried to scream and nothing came out, I tried harder as I began to really panic, tears were streaming down my cheeks now and inside my mind I was screaming like a frightened child. I had the feeling that an Entity was in that room with me and they were not going to stop doing what they were doing. I couldn’t see any “person” holding that device but I was sure they were near and controlling the whole situation. I tried to scream one last time and this time I heard a quiet scream eminate from my mouth and echo in the room. Well this was enough apparently to scare away whatever was doing this to me. The device disappeared and the foggy mist was gone.  I thought to try to see if I was still paralyzed and thank god I could now move my arms and turn my head.  It was nothing like waking from a dream, it was like being released from a paralyzed state.  My eyes were open the whole time, and now I realized how frightened I was because the tears were wet on my face, I was shaking and I was out of breath. My next thought was to make my way out of bed before whatever it was came back and paralyzed me again. I was so scared like I never have been In my whole life. It took every bit of courage I had to get out of bed and run to my mothers room. I am a 50 year old man and I felt like a three year old running to my mommy for help. I did make it out of the bedroom and down the hall to her room. I spoke to her as I approached her room and she woke up and turned on her light to find me standing there shivering an! d crying asking her if she heard me scream.  She said no she did not hear me scream and what was goin on, why was I waking her up, what was the matter.  I thought this entity was just in the other room still watching me, so I was whispering that something weird just visited me in bed and that I thought it was still close by. We stayed in her room and talked about what happened for about an hour until I calmed downed. She tried to make me believe that it was a dream but I have had dreams and nightmares before and this was not anything like that. This essentially ends the event for the moment. It happened again about an hour later after I returned to bed, but that will be for a different time to report if at all because I can’t say for sure it wasn’t a bad dream caused by the original event…",2011-12-12T00:00:00,38.70717218543046,-121.79490860927153

This aircraft was flying at a very slow speed and could move horizontally and vertically.  We were able to watch it for about 15 minutes.  I tried to take a picture of it but it did not turn out well at all. October/November 2011 I am a night owl and we live in a relatively rural area.  I am always out watching for raccoons so they do not get the feral cats and typically am watching the night sky.  Lately I have noticed several bright lights that do not appear to be stars nor satellites (yes, my boyfriend already said that I was probably seeing a satellite, but I am college educated and have taken numerous astronomy classes, so I definitely know the difference) There are two distinctly bright orbs that appear to be relatively close.  They seem to set off some type of flare or flash and seem to illuminate.  Around the two brightest orbs dimmer orbs seem to come and go.  The bright object and the dimmer objects are very distinctly positioned, so these are not just some random lights, they are patterned. Early this morning, Sunday, November 20, 2011 I was looking in one of my typical observation spots in the sky (same place we saw the aircraft object last summer) and all of the sudden there was what appeared to be a very slow shooting star and/or comet type object except I could see a disc like object in it and it left a very visible trail.  The disc disappeared; almost as if it were going into a wormhole or time warp, yet the trail of smoke or cloud lingered on beyond the time I stayed to observe (15 minutes+) I had never seen anything like it.  The sky was clear and my visibility was excellent.  I felt lucky to have seen something so amazing. I decided to go online and search UFO sightings in Skagit County, Washington to see if there are any other night owls or sunbathers who have spotted these phenomena?  I will continue to watch, most of the time I feel like I am being watched in return.  It is very odd.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,,

I believe less in the American media than I do in UFO’s so I have been lead to this sight to describe what I saw in the hopes of keeping others informed. It was a huge brilliant blue triangular object traveling Very Fast across the horizon; I was yelling at a friend and my son to look up in the sky.  To my dismay it disappeared leaving a big red ball of fire and two smaller red balls.  At this time my friend and son were looking and two to three seconds later there was a sound as if something struck something.   My friend heard the sound but my son quickly dismissed it because in the opposing direction he saw fireworks declaring that must be the sound but my friend and I swore that the sound came from the direction I was looking in. Later that night, over the phone my friend and I did some internet research considering that it was a comet burning in the atmosphere.  To my dismay, the news casters reported that several people called in saying they saw something in the sky.  The reporters scoffed and joked saying it was space junk, or a falling satellite, or just people drinking too much. This is insulting and not believable.  For starters, what I saw was brilliant and bright blue with a white glow. It was distinctively a triangle and moved faster than I ever seen from right to left leaving behind 3 red balls, one far larger than the other two. It was beautiful, nothing like I have ever seen. At the angle and height of the object it had to be bigger that 4 or 5 larger airplanes.  I haven’t seen anything this large I assumed it to be a meteor or a shooting star or Superman because it was a bright blue streak across the sky. LOL.  I joked that Superman was coming to rescue me.  My friend said I should make a wish. I feel comfortable to say my wish…it was for our planet and its salvation. I don’t know what I saw but I ran into people in my community the next day that saw it as well. I am calling it a meteor but the more I think about it the more I think it was other worldly, unique and beautiful. Definitely not space junk…This was not that.

As I drove for another 5-6 seconds, I considered turning on and grabbing my video camera that I had in the car with me. I am doubtful when it comes to a UFO sighting (I've always wanted to see one) so I feel as if my mind plays tricks on me.   This was no trick.  It was huge.  And as I drove with smy head out my drivers side window and stared, I rolled through a light.   There were 3 ladies out running on the corner, and they had stopped to wait for the light.  I looked at them to see if they were seeing what I was seeing but it did not seem like it.   The UFO hadn't left my sight.  So I turned my camera on and pulled into my neighborhood.  As I drove in, the houses blocked the UFO.   When I returned to open road, couldn't have been more than 25-30 seconds, it was gone from sight.

I watched it, not because it was doing anything interesting, but because it was in my line of sight.   As it came closer, I couldn't see any wings, and so continued to watch it, to see if it was jet plane, or a propeller plane, whatever... just idle curiosity.

Saw first craft at 8:52pm.  It was silver in color, cigar-shaped.  It had no contrail and was flying much higher than an airplane, but you could tell it was much larger than an airplane and had no wings.  It seemed smooth.  At times the silvery color appeared whiter or lighter in areas, but did not seem to be light, more the metal itself reflecting light?  That's a guess.  We watched it fly from West to East over a period of about 2 minutes or so.  It was long enough to watch it slowly glide out of sight.  At 8:03pm, I saw a solid black object in the sky.  At first I thought it was just a black bird because they are usually flying around, but I noticed it wasn't moving or if it was moving, it was coming straight at me.  Regardless, it was not fluttering about like a bird.  I watched it for a second, my girlfriend was on the balcony during all of this and I pointed it out.  She doesn't see as well as I do and I watched it get much closer before she was able to see it.  It was so far away or so high in the sky that I couldn't even make out a definite shape to this object.  Briefly, I thought I saw what appeared to be a triangle, but this object was sitting upright.  When it got to it's closest point near us, we could both clearly tell it was moving, rotating.  It would rotate around and turn itself as it was rotating.  I hope that's clear.  At some point, it curved off and started heading East (from the South).  Neither one of us could make out what shape this thing was.  It was! a solid upright object, not like the longer, more horizontal cigar-shaped object.  In the dropdown list before filling this out, I looked to see if any of those may have described it: like I said, it looked at some point to have at least a triangular edge to it, so it could have been ""diamond"" shaped, but I'm not entirely certain, but that's the best way to describe at least the edge I did see and the mass of the object itself.  This object appeared to have a haziness around it.  At it's closest point to us, it was probably about the size of my pinky nail if my arm was stretched out.  It was small, but very far and very high.  It stood out like a sore thumb because it was solid black on a light blue sky.  You couldn't miss it.  This one also moved much slower in comparison to the silver cigar-shaped object, which it probably why it appeared to be standing still when I first saw it.  Also, this thing came pretty much out of nowhere.  I don't know if I ever mention that, but! the same for the cigar-shaped objects.  We suddenly just see ! them and then watch as they glide away.  We never see them come INTO view.  They are just suddenly there.  Since we have frequently been seeing this, we contacted MUFON locally and I was contacted by an investigator.  While witnessing what I described above, I called the investigator.  He called me back later and it turned out he witnessed the exact same object I saw first-- the cigar-shaped one, heading the same direction, etc.  If it's any help to gauge the size of this object, he lives approximately 2-3 miles from me.  He mentioned that it was not an airplane, had no contrail, etc etc etc and ultimately it could not be identified. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  One of several from the same source.

On Monday, February 20th, my daughter and I were driving from Greenville, MS to Lake Providence, LA. About 5 miles North of Eudora, Arkansas I noticed a very, very bright light in the sky to the east and approximately at a 60 degree angle from the road I was driving on.  This time of year, the days are longer, and even though it was partly cloudy it was still bright out. THAT is what made me question what it was that I was seeing. The brightness of this light, it was sooo very bright for that time of day. It also did not move and it didn't blink or anything. The only way I can explain it is a very, very bright star, but not twinkling. My daughter also saw this light. We watched it as the clouds moved behind it, making us believe it couldn't be a star/planet if we could see the clouds moving behind it. I continued to drive, we both watched it for a good 3 to 5 minutes before it went behind a cloud. We never saw it again. I continued to look in that general loc! ation in the sky, however, never saw anything else that I could pass off as being what I saw during the daylight. I came home and googled planets, read that we should be able to see 5 planets this month, but all of which would be in the west, and rising at dusk or later. I don't know what we saw, but thought that it might be interesting to report it here. I've seen other things and so have friends of mine and this is my first time to actually tell anyone outside of my small circle. And amazingly enough, as I've been reading your reports, I came across one that gave me chills because it described an exact sighting my daughter and I had in the same town, the same year, the same month...almost the exact same story as what I have to tell. So, again, if what we saw last week was just a planet or a star, then that's fine...i would like to know what it was just for curiousity's sake.

I decided to go back to the driveway and rested my arms on my car. I was finally able to capture a clear portion where the light fades out. The camera seemed to continuously re-focus itself and the next few times that it appears to fade out it! is really just the camera re-focusing. However, the first time on the video, it does completely disappear as I was literally keeping one eye on the camera and one eye free to watch the light. It faded several times as I watched with the naked eye as well prior to filming. I determined that this was not clouds blocking the object as has been suggested. I observed several other dimmer stars that could be observed through the thin clouds that were present. Also, the clouds were moving much too slow to cause the light to fade so quickly and return so quickly. I checked the skies about 1 hour later and the light was gone. I will re-check the area tonight at 8:30pm and if the skies are clear and no light is visible, this will eliminate the possibility that the object was a star.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,39.0457,-78.2276

Ofcourse,it is pitch black where we smoke and the only light that comes is from the moon and the reflection of the city lights which are probably 50km's behind us. We noticed these two lights which at first we thought were stars but suddenly they flew across the sky and hid behind a cloud.Not to be seen for a minute or so. They sped across the sky and stopped.  My friend and me got really excited as this was the first time we witnessed a UFO and we have always talked about it. By that time,we noticed that these objects were drifting closer and lower.  We did get scared a little but we didn't budge.  We stood there waiting for something else to happen.

Because I live in the country, there are few lights outside.  These, however, were extremely bright and appeared to be spinning in a random pattern.  There were three lights that were all the same, but in different areas.  They were very close to the tree line, if not in it.  At that time, they were across the river from me. I watched to see if they could be part of something else, but one of them started to rise up in the air.  At first, I wasn't sure if I could believe my eyes, but it kept going up, then started to come towards my house across the river.  It moved in a 90 degree angle, straight up, then straight out and appeared to do so very smoothly, almost like being on a  conveyer belt.  I lost track of the other two lights when the one started moving. At this point, I grabbed my cell phone to try to video it, but was afraid that it was somehow aware of me, as it was coming straight toward my house.  Because I was nervous I held my phone at my stomach and tried to guess to where to find it to film it.  Unfortunately this was unsuccessful and not the smartest. However, I did, for about 1-2 full minutes watch the aircraft.  It came across the river and right over my garage which is directly outside my window.  My window was already up.  I had a fan running on a table below the window.  The fan is not loud, but the aircraft was so quiet that I turned off the fan to try to hear it, even as it was right in front of me.  I could barely hear it. What I saw was a huge triangular aircraft that was just cruising along.  I can't believe how big it was, how quiet it was, and how slow it was moving.  It had huge round lights underneath.  I could not see the top when it went by, and as it was coming toward me it was dark outside so I cannot say for sure, but it almost appeared to be just a solid triangular mass.  The bottom for sure, and the sides were clear to see.  I was probably no more than 30 feet from it.  I was stunned and didn't chase after it outside, but I wish I did.

It was already dark and shortly after 5:00 pm.  She was on the freeway very close to the Smith College exit into Northampton, MA when she saw flashing lights out of the corner of her eye.  She looked through her windshield to the right and saw a diamond-shaped object that appeared to be either very close--about 200 yards away and only 500 or so feet up--or very large.  This was a discreet object.  Each point of the diamond-shaped object had a red light.  These red lights flashed rhythmically and in unison. Every now and again, a white, translucent light would ""scatter"" flash across and around the body of the craft.  She says that the craft appeared to be metallic, that she could clearly see its shape, and that it was stationary.  She tried to take a picture of it with her cell phone, but was so rattled that her hand blocked the shot (she continued to! drive down the freeway during her sighting).  She glanced down to place her cell phone on the passenger seat and when she looked back up (after only a couple of seconds), the craft was gone.  She pulled over to the side of the highway and got out of her car to search the sky because she couldn't fathom how the object could simply disappear the way it did. She said that the experience was ""freaky,"" but not frightening.  She said that she immediately felt that what she was seeing was ""not normal,"" and she said that she felt as if she was being observed during her sighting.  She also thinks it's significant that the object disappeared immediately after she tried to take a picture of it.   When she got back to Smith College, she talked about her sighting to several of her friends, one of whom volunteered that this past summer, she had also had a sighting of a diamond-shaped UFO just sitting over a Burger King in Amherst.

This area is more open with pastures for dairy farming and there is also a garbage refuse center so there is no city or neighborhood in the area.  It had just gotten dark as i was passing through the area so everyone had their headlights on, it had just rained earlier that day so the clouds in the sky were breaking up allowing for the night sky to be seen in fragments.  Driving along i had a sudden urge to lean forward over the steering wheel and look up out into the sky, it was kind of one of those feelings that i just got, not to look for anything in particular but just to look at the sky.  At just that moment i could see part of a cloud illuminate with a fluorescent green color and through a break in the clouds a bright ball of green light descended at quite a fast pace.  It dropped maybe 500ft or so from the cloud cover which might have been a 1000ft! above.  This green ball of light was traveling extremely fast toward the north and was only descending down to then sweep back up towards the clouds, before reaching the clouds it picked up speed, a lot of speed.  It stayed below the clouds but began moving so fast that it disappeared before my eyes.  The duration of the sighting may have only been about 30sec. but was indeed something I have never witnessed in my life.  The object was a solid ball of light, its color was green and when it began picking up speed there was no trail behind it.  It looked as though it had come through the clouds dipping for seconds before going so fast i could not see it anymore.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,38.09954836956522,-122.5779285326087

The first object appeared out of the South at first it looked like an airplane when the object appeared overhead the object was a pale glowing light.  No strobe on the craft was seen as you would see on private or commercial aircraft. At first I thought the craft was low flying but the craft I believe was at very high altitude and moving at a high rate of speed  it almost looked like the craft for a second reflected the sun so I thought that perhaps it is a satellite. The second craft appeared on the same trajectory as the craft got closer and saw that it looks just like the first craft at this point I dismissed the first craft as being a satellite.  The chararesitics were the same pale light  seemed to be at an extereme altitude.  This craft appeared to look slow but again because of the high altitude, once you figure in the altitude you realize the the high rate of speed they ate traveling. The third craft came in about 5mins later perhaps a little more SSE so I had move about 300 ft to get a better view of the object, the trajectory was the same South to North the object had the same chararestics as the first two objects no difference at all. The fourth object appeared about 7 mins later but was diffent that the first three the craft looked bigger you could just barely see the craft.  The craft was illuminated very dimly with white lights that were pale this craft also looked very high in altitude so size of the craft was hard to to tell however the craft a triangular shape. None of the four crafts had any sound what so ever.  I watched the sky for thirty more mins and did not see any other objects.

I look the other way and my wife yells i  turn around towards the woodsO and there it was again a reddish orb rising of the the woods clear as day. I turn back around and yell to my family that the orb they were talking about was back.  Then all six o! f us were there to see it.It went straight up so smooth and effortlessly and then made a 90 degree curved turn and hovered off in the distance and never made a sound and I would have to guess it was with a few mIles.   But after I picked my jaw off the ground I remembered that I had my iPod and caught the last few minutes on video and catching our reactions. it's a little dark but it's there with some cleaning of the video maybe someone can shed some light on this.  So by the end of the we got 6 wittnesses and two videos of this. When I first saw it we were on the porch and it appeared west of us at eye level in the woods rose I'd say about a mile then headed north for a few more miles before it was out of sight. As far as the first two sightings this nite I was not there for the third I was.,2012-01-12T00:00:00,38.4779,-90.5347

I would describe it, as almost a flash of light wasn’t there previously, so naturally it caught our definite attention.    So we looked directly at it and for a few seconds as it very quickly got brighter and much bigger, like it was moving directly towards us, then in the  very same moment just as we were discussing how it was getting brighter way too fast to be a plane,  It just as quickly got smaller, dimmed, and disappeared like it was traveling away from us moving directly the same direction it had came.

I saw three orange-ish red lights in the shape of a triangle in the southern sky.  They were rotating and gyrating while staying in shape. It was approx. 40 degrees high in the sky.   My mom did not see them because a tree was blocking her view.  My brother and I ran downstairs and outside to get a better look. My parents followed us.  It was lightning and thundering in the distance and as the lightning lit up the sky I saw a black colored center with the three lights on each corner but that was the only time I saw the center.   As it moved across the sky to the west, a forth light approached from the lower left side of the triangle. It didn't appear to be connected to the other three lights, but it was the same orange-red color.   As it came closer to the triangle shape only one of those lights was still vis! ible. Then both lights faded into the clouds.  It was really intense cloud cover with an extreme amount of lighting. We didn't see it again after that.  The whole sighting was approx. 2-3 minutes.  We didn't even think to take a picture of it until it was out of sight.  My mom did try to find our binoculars but didn't in time.  My mother, father and brother all witnessed the event.  My mother made a police report with 911 and reported it to local news stations via emails.   We are curious if anyone else saw it or have pics to prove what we saw.  I had my cell phone in my pocket but was too awe struck to even think of taking a picture.  We were kind of paralyzed by the thought of what we were witnessing.

After maybe twenty seconds, the light increased in its intensity for about five seconds before returning to its previous lower brightness.  I would say that the light increased its brightness by a factor of four or five.  It repeated that pattern of temporarily increasing its brightness three times.

It was about 8:50 p.m. on a Tuesday night, Tuesday the 27th of September 2011, when my fiancé and I saw what looked like a ball of fire coming from the north, moving across the sky.  The night was mostly overcast with slightly orange tinted clouds, the wind was gently blowing from the north, and the temperature was about 60-65 degrees.  We were on our way to the store, walking up and around a nearby hill, in a mostly residential neighborhood, when it appeared. I at first thought it was just a brightly lighted plain or helicopter, but then noticed that the light seemed fire-like, red-orange-yellow, and slightly flickering.  There was no sound coming from it.  The next thing we noticed, for both my fiancé and I were watching at this point, was that the fire/light seemed to be focusing towards the back of the craft, and then went out completely, about the time it passed over-head, though a little to the right from where we were standing.  And because the clouds were somewhat bright from the light pollution of the city, we both saw that, after the light had faded, there remained a small, dark, circular object.  At a distance it looked as small as a pupil, between an eighth and a quarter inch.  But there was no mistaking its flawless shape and its smooth edges. It was a perfect circle, black to my eyes, at least in the darkness.  Still silent, it continued on southward until we lost sight of it in the distance. Amazed, and a little frightened, we asked each other some typical questions, just to make sure we were both seeing the same thing as it was happening. “Could you see it?   Did you see its shape?  I can’t believe this!”  Then, about 30 seconds later, from the same direction, another one appeared, as silent as the first.  It looked the same; fiery, moving southward, and its light also slowly receded towards the rear of the craft, and then went out, again, revealing a dark, round object beneath the clouds.   We both observed that the light went out about the same moment as the first, almost directly overhead of us, but to the right.  But unlike the first craft, which held a seemingly straight course, and remained dark, this one turned left and right in small, quick and smooth movements, and relit; just a flicker in the rear, fiery like before, only faint and small.  Then, the small light that reappeared seemed to move around the edge of the craft, in either direction, but never in a ful! l circle.  (I found this particularly strange, because I assume that a round craft would most likely spin to stay in flight, but the small light that reappeared did not.)  The light then seemed to go out again as the ship went further away into the distance. Almost as soon as we lost sight of the second craft, a third appeared.  Again, it came from the north and made its way south, looking just like the first two, and making no sound.  This one acted more like the second craft though, turning slightly, this way and that, and relighting after about 5-10 seconds of darkness, during which it was revealed as another round, dark object beneath the clouds.  The light that reappeared on this craft was small like the other, and also seemed to move around the edge of the dark circle it was attached to, but not in full circles. Before the third was even out of sight, the fourth appeared, just as the others had, and acted much like the second and third.   Each one was completely silent, all moving at what looked like the same speed, and in the same direction, taking about 25 seconds to cross from one edge of the sky to the other. Then, there was no more to be seen for what felt like 2-3 minutes, and we continued on to the store, watching the sky behind us. We were heading west.  After about 2 or 3 more minutes, we reached the store and went in.  The clock in the store said that it was almost 9:00 p.m. Coming out, we looked again towards the direction of the sighting, and saw the fifth and final craft. At this point we were surrounded by a bit more tree growth, and further away, so we didn’t get a good look.  But we saw that it was plainly another light of the same color, moving in the same direction, and its light also seemed to extinguish, though we couldn’t see if it came back or not. It was the first time either of us had seen anything like this, and as soon as we got home we start searching for the right people to talk to.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,44.039544983277594,-123.12515735785954

I walked out the back door to feed my dog, hurrying because it was cold and I didn't have a jacket.  I was maybe 20 feet from the house when something made me stop. (I'm getting shivers just remembering this) I looked up in the sky and almost overhead, hovering in total silence, was a large saucer shaped craft.  It seemed close enough to reach out and touch, but of course it really wasn't. It had trapazoidal shaped white lights? Or windows of light?, that rotated around the craft, from left to right, skipping every other panel. The trapazoids were narrower at the top, wider at the bottom. I just stood there staring at it in total shock I guess, for who knows how long. I remember screaming, dropping the dog food and running for the house. When I started running, it started moving, heading west at an extremely high rate of speed. Remember, I lived near Wright-Pat, had been to the Dayton Air Show, had seen fighter planes and the blue angels. I knew what a plane looked like in the sky. I had never seen anything moving at the speed this thing attained. By the time I could get my father and air force uncle to the door, maybe a span of 20-30 seconds, it was nearly out of sight on the horizon. My uncle said he had never seen anything move so fast. I have always wondered if anyone else saw anything in the sky that night in Ohio. Later in life, I learned about Roswell, aliens, UFO's, and watched shows about Hanger 18 at Wright-Pat. I've wondered if this was reverse technology in action. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2011-08-21T00:00:00,,

On a beautiful summer's night in the mid 1970's, the sky was clear and you could see all the stars. This was in the countryside, very dark, with a great view of the sky.  I was at my brother-in-law's house helping him work on his drag-racing car. I left about 11:00 P.M. My home was about 150 yards from his. I got about halfway across his yard,almost in mine and I stopped to relieve myself. It was so pretty out, I was looking around while I was doing my business.   I turned my head to the right and saw something I'll never forget.  It was hovering about 100 feet off the ground, not making a sound. It was oval  shaped and had lights that were all the way across it.  They were not going off and on but dimming and brightening. I stood there for about 15 seconds and thought about my brother-in-law. I called him and he came out wanting to know what was wrong and I told him to look and he couldn't believe it.  He said, ""What is that""?  We stood there probably 30 sec. or more looking at it and all of a sudden it went straight up at a speed of nothing like on this planet, to an altitude to where it was about the size of my fingernail.  The object didn't make a sound and it stopped dead still and sat there about 5 sec. and made a 90 degree left turn and went about a half mile and dead stopped again.  It sat there about 10 sec. and made a 90 degree to the right. This time it went over the trees into the horizon and we never saw it again.  My brother-in-law wanted to get in the car and chase it but I told him it was probably long gone. There is nothing man made, to my knowledge, that can travel that fast, hover without making a sound and stop dead still when it stops.  All of this lasted, maybe, 3 or4 minutes but it seemed like a lot longer. I didn't tell many people because I thought they would just laugh. Since then, my brother-in-law has passed away and I've wished a thousand times I would have told the authorities and tried to find out what it was.  I've heard many stories similar to mine through the years. I've thought about being hypnotized to relive the experience.  I don't know where it came from or what it was but it was real.

I just ignored the sighting until all of a sudden at least 20 feet above my car there was a huge v like aircraft. This aircraft was about 10 ft long side to side and had a series of about 20 large square lights from side to side on the front of the V which was facing me.  The lights on one side were green and the other 10 or so extremely bright lights were red on the other side.  Once I saw this I swear my stomach dropped and I floored my car.  All I knew was that this wasn’t any toy plane at midnight or anything else I have ever seen.  This object flew over my car in the opposite direction I was going.  As I looked above over my steering wheel I could see the lights so distinctly like it was burned into the back of my eyes.  As I quickly drove off I could see it distinctly behind me until I got to a good observation point above the small city less than 20 seconds later.  It was gone.

There were no blinking lights or spotlights; I am positive it was not an airplane or helicopter. I am not sure what it was that we saw.  It stayed at the same height going straight across the sky horizontally for about 3 minutes.

The night sky was clear.  First sighted heading west – began as a triangle formation of three white “star” sized lights moving very slowly.  Next we noticed some lights were following behind the triangle.  Formation began to change to a somewhat wide cluster, dispersing the triangle shape of three lights at the front of the movement of lights and appearing as if they were all just part of a tight constellation of stars, almost imobile but still some small movement westward.  Anyone looking up at this time may have thought it was just a concentrated area of stars and thought nothing of it for the several seconds or minute it was formed this way.  The lights (at least 20, probably more) then began moving, still very slowly but more noticeably, and forming a narrower line formation which then curved strongly to head north-northwest.  They seemed to be flickering now in different colors occasionally as green, blue, red, and white, but mostly white, as they passed almo! st directly above us.  Sometimes an occasional brighter flaring of color would come from one of the lights; and sometimes they were no more than an average star brightness in white.  The catepillar-like loose, linear formation of lights continued north-northwest until they became too far away and 'dim' to continue to track.  There was no sound; no aircraft sounds.  The entire sighting lasted about 10 to 15 minutes.  We called our neighbors over to view – 3 adults and one minor child.  Upon first sight of the “constellation-like” scattering formation, our neighbor thought it was just that, a cluster of stars, until he realized they were moving, and continued to watch the procession of lights changing formation and moving in the sky above us.

Does anyone care about this stuff ? ________________________________________________________________________________ BREAKING NEWS ALERTS FLAGLER BEACH -- What did people see crash into the Atlantic Ocean late Tuesday night off the Flagler County coast?  That question remained unanswered Wednesday morning, and investigators have called off a search for a possible plane crash. Dispatchers started getting calls Tuesday night reporting a fireball falling out of the sky and into the ocean off Flagler Beach, near State Roads A1A and 100. Witnesses said they thought it might be a plane that crashed about 7 miles offshore. Flagler County deputies then called the Volusia County Sheriff's Office, asking if they could use that agency's helicopter, AirOne, to help in the search. The helicopter was sent up, but officials quickly realized that the search area would be too far out over the open water to safely operate the aircraft. So AirOne had to turn around and head back to shore. Deputies then notified the Coast Guard, which sent a boat from Station Ponce Inlet to begin searching. But officials called off the search late Wednesday morning. Petty Officer Jessica Potter said the Coast Guard found no wreckage or any other sign that a plane went down. She also said there were no reports of missing or overdue aircraft in the area. While officials said it probably wasn't a plane, one witness, Nick Kennerly, told us he saw the light and saw where it came from. Kennerly said a couple staying at a nearby motel lit a Chinese lantern. It's much like a hot air balloon. He said the lantern it simply caught fire and fell into the ocean. No one from the Coast Guard was immediately available to comment on that possibility.

I literally just pulled into my driveway at home after a 5 hour car drive from where I go to college. I am someone who is very intelligent, as I go to a very prestigious school, and I question nearly everything I learn.  Growing up in a Catholic family, I always questioned things, such as my religion and its truth, because I like proof-hard facts-for things before I can truly believe something to be true.  I took an English course my freshman year of college that was centered on supernatural happenings, and sure enough, one of the main topics we focused on was extraterrestrial life. It sounds silly, really; however, when you think in the grand scheme of things, it is only logical that there is life somewhere else in our universe, as Earth is just a grain of sand compared to the universe as a whole.  But, the idea of UFOs with flashing lights that are flying all over our sky to me always sounded dumb and unbelievable.  I had the impression that people reporting these ""sightings"" were uneducated or perhaps literally on drugs. I am saying all of this solely because I just stepped out of my car ten minutes ago, was a little creeped out because it is 1 in the morning and a dark, foggy night...sounds all too cliche and typical.  But as I opened my trunk and unloaded my bags, something caught my eye in the sky.  I am not kidding, this silver disk/saucer looking thing with orange lights on it was inching across the sky. I could see it so distinctly, this object was so complex and large and not high in the sky whatsoever. It was traveling so slowly, I didn't know what to do. I can honestly say I have never experienced such a feeling like this before; I was absolutely astonished. I thought I was hallucinating. I didn't move a muscle and starred at this ""UFO"" if you will, slowly cruise along the hazy clouds, and in the split of a second it was gone.  I am shaking and don't know what to think.

Two of us were sitting on the beach in a secluded area, about 10 miles south of Yachats, Oregon.  We had a small fire burning, and I was constantly looking up at the sky because it was completely clear and we could see many stars.  Both of us believe in alien life, but I am especially interested in UFOlogy and was hoping I would see a ""smoking gun"" UFO while I looked at the sky.  My companion is skeptical regarding UFOs. After 45 minutes to an hour of looking up at the sky, I noticed some moving lights above and slightly to the north of us.  I saw a series of between 5-8 white-yellow lights around most of the craft and a single, slowly blinking red light at the back of the craft.  Not seeing any strobes or FAA navigation lights or recognizing it as an aircraft, we walked further out onto the beach to get a better look. I would say the craft was about the size of a golf ball at arm's length, maybe slightly bigger.  At first I assumed it was a commercial jet taking off, but there isn't an airport nearby, and the lighting on the craft was abnormal.  I didn't hear any aircraft noise, but we were next to the waves, which were loud. The craft looked arrow-shaped, with three white-yellow lights forming a triangle at the top, then at least one or two lights forming a narrower cylinder like a fuselage, and two more white-yellow lights extending like an arrow at the back of the craft.  The blinking red light (the only observable blinking light on the craft) was centered between the two back white-yellow lights. The craft flew overhead slightly toward the northwest, and looked like a stereotypical ""flying saucer"" with a row of lights when we viewed it from the side.  As it flew further out to sea, it arced around to eventually travel southwest.  I watched the blinking red light as it disappeared out of sight over the ocean southwest of us.  It definitely appeared to be heading out to sea instead of along the coastline. I don't consider this my ""smoking gun"" UFO because it didn't appear to defy any laws of physics as we know them, but my companion and I both agree that what we saw was abnormal.

I was working on my book on the computer and our Dachshund  Gracie was Grrr-ing at me like ""Come On Dad, I really need to go outside right now"". Dad was working on edits, but she persisted, so I put on my sandals and headed out the front door with her. There was an airplane flying over in the Northeast, so I looked up. There, at about 70 degrees up in the north north east what caught my eye were two very bright objects, brighter than Venus and larger in apparent diameter, and with a bit more of a yellow white color to them, similar in color to incandescent car headlights or aircraft landing lights. They were moving slowly, significantly more slowly than an average satellite, and flying due north about the width of my thumbnail (at arms length) apart in direct line with each other, both equal brightness and one directly behind the other following the exact same course. My first thought was that it was as bright as an Iridium Flare, but the Iridium satellites do not fly in clo! se formation, they are distributed around the planet for good satellite phone reception.  Well, what happened next pretty well cinched it.  They both dimmed down together, not at the same spot but at the same time, and then the dimmer ""satellites"" changed formation, with one moving off to the side and catching up with the other while moving from it's 6 o:clock position to it's 4 o:clock but keeping about the same relative distance.  So, obviously at least one of the two objects changed speed and direction, unless it was actually one LARGE object that changed orientation.  Either way, it wasn't normal!  I checked the time when I got back on the front porch and got some light on my watch and it was 9:20 PM MT Thursday, Sept. 28th, so it happened between 9:18 and 9:19 PM, observed from my front yard in Evergreen, CO. I came in and checked Heaven's Above, and there were NO Iridium satellites visible at all from this location this evening.  It is pretty early in the evening for a ""Satellite"" to go dark that high in the sky, the terminator (Earth's shadow) should still be farther east, (unless they were much lower and in the atmosphere) and they were still visible though much dimmer for another 30 seconds or so.  The only published satellites anywhere close to this time are these, and neither was in the proper direction, anywhere near high enough or bright enough.

So I figured OK well I'll go get my binoculars and entertain her.  It was just a normal airplane.  So I tried looking at the airplane when she exclaimed well what is that?  It was a point of light that was changing in intensity.  It was about as bright at first as a planet in the sky.  It was approaching the airplane in the sky.  It changed angle slightly but flew mostly straight and became very dim till we could not see it.  It seemed to be heading 30 degrees south/west 0 deg = west.  It might have been following the airplane but we are not sure of the exact elevation.  Then it came back the other way also very dim and small such that we could barely make it out.  It looked to be retracing its previous path.  I remember exclaiming that it seemed unusual that it didn't have blinking lights like the air plane.  It was also white while it was bright but became o! range when it became dim and small.  To me from memory it was moving about 1.5 times faster than the airplane from our perception.  The airplane had 2 red flashing lights and heading south/west 12 degrees. 0 degrees being west.  The airplane was almost directly over head but a bit south.  Maybe 80 - 85 deg elevation by the time the unknown object was spotted heading back.,2011-08-21T00:00:00,40.412,-90.6238

It was May 30, 2008, when my wife and I were driving back home after eating at a restaurant downtown.  We were on I-10 eastbound, driving 70-ish, in abnormally non-existent traffic for a Friday night.  When we were a couple of miles past the Davis Hwy interchange, I noticed a light twin airplane passing overhead and to my left (north of highway), going south, low in altitude (200-300 ft) presumably for landing (as we could see landing lights and gear extended). This isn't unusual, the traffic patterns frequently pass over for that particular runway.  But, a bright ring of 10 or more amber lights behind/beside the plane startled me, thinking someone just launched a ring-shaped fireworks display in dangerously close proximity to this landing plane. As the plane continued, apparently ignorant of these lights, the mystery lights seemed to shut off, and disappear rather quickly.  I quickly asked my wife if she had seen these ""fireworks,"" as she was in the front passenger seat of our jeep wrangler.  She said she had not, but as I started to describe the lights (8-12 in number) as we continued down the road, they reappeared, as if they ""turned on"" with a switch, still to my left, above the trees, but at least 1000-2000ft (east) from where I saw it last.  It seemed as though whatever it was, it was moving at least 80+ mph, since it reappeared slightly ahead of us, and we were going E @ 70 mph. My wife saw it this time, and agreed it did look like fireworks (in shape and color), only to watch it disappear seconds later again, instantly. We were now a little confused, knowing it was not a plane, blimp, flares, or a mobile fireworks platform. As we continued east, and are struggling to say anything further, it reappears again, instantly, and it is now apparent that these lights (8-12, unsure of number) must be fixed to a solid object, and are flashing at an interval of a couple seconds on (all of them), and then off simultaneously for a couple seconds. It was apparently tracking to the east-south-east, heading towards the bay and beyond. As the interstate curves to the north approaching Scenic Highway, the object crossed over the lanes, and because of its altitude and direction, my wife thought it would hit the Ramada Inn. It passed over though, still blinking its amber lights rhythmically, and we followed it on the off-ramp to Scenic Hwy. When we got to the traffic light, my wife frantically pleaded that we go south on Scenic and follow it. I just sat and stared as it continued east-southeast over the bay, apparently unable to speak or drive, or follow my wife's instructions. She asked me several more times, and! I instead turned North to go home. I don't know why I didn't follow it, I wished that I had, but something majorly psychological was computing in my brain, and refusing to accept what we knew we just saw. I had never seen a ufo before, but my life has not been the same since. I am glad that my wife saw it as well, otherwise I would think I was crazy. We went home and drew independent pictures, and the only variance was our perspective, while I saw a complete ring, she saw something closer to that of an omega/horse-shoe/open ring. The color was the same in both of our perspectives, somewhere between orange and yellow, amber would be the best word in my opinion. The distance/size was nearly impossible to perceive, it could have been 30 feet above, 300 feet above, or 3000 feet above. The limiting factors were the trees it passed over, the plane it did not collide with, and the high cloud ceiling. In my opinion, it would seem as though it were close to 300 feet in altitude, considering it cleared the trees, and seemed to follow the path of the interstate. If it were at that distance, I would estimate it's size to be 50-100 feet in ""diameter"", but that's only an estimation based on estimated height. The light twin airplane seen at the beginning of the! sighting was estimated nearly 200-300 feet ( could have been even 500 feet ) in altitude, and with my life experience around planes/airports/military air stations, I can safely assume that the wingspan of the plane was 20-30 feet tops. The ring was nearly twice the size of the plane when they were in ""close"" proximity to each other, but I don't have experience around such phenomenon to know what normal is for size or distance. We could not hear a sound, but our Jeep is noisy on the freeway. By comparison, the airplane was audible and sounded like a turboprop (it may have been a reciprocating prop w/ 3-blade engines, however, not really sure at the glance we had in those conditions), and was briefly and typically heard as it passed overhead. We don't know what the environmental conditions for wind were, windows were up and the temperature was unknown as well (A/C was probably on), there were no visible stars or moon, cloud ceiling was high enough not to reflect billboard lights or other urban lighting that is typical in the area. When we rolled to a stop at the offramp traffic light, the road noise diminshed and no sound was perceived as the ring of lights continued east over the bay. I have considered and reconsidered repeatedly what it was or was not, and can only say what it was not based on several key facts. 1) It was not a satellite, I have seen hundreds in my lifetime, none of them were amber, or traveling in coordinated groups/formation. 2) It was not meteor or comet, I have seen hundreds of either in my lifetime, including several meteor showers and eye-visible comets, they do not remain in formation over 3 miles and flash off and on repeatedly. 3) It was not military flares, I have seen those on t.v. and other videos, I am fairly certain they would not be dropped over the interstate or next to civilian aircraft on approach to landing, not to mention the residential areas that surrounded the freeway. There are many bases nearby, both air force and navy, and Eglin's expanse seems like a more logical testing site for such activities as flare drops. 4) I don't believe it was a blimp, the size could match, but the lights (we frequently see the Tostit! o's and Goodyear blimps at night and day flying to KPNS) and speed (over 70 MPH) seem unreasonable. 5) I don't think it was a civilian aircraft due to the other air traffic's close proximity, and there were no typical light patterns (no strobes, nav lights, or anti-collision lights), and I have never seen a disc shaped plane (I think the government mothballed most 50 years ago for various reasons). 6) The only other rational reason is bunk as well, if it was a 'top-secret' military aircraft, I think the above mentioned location (interstate 10, densely residential NE Pensacola, planes landing at the same time) would have blown the cover of a black project. Again, with nearby expanses of unpopulated testing grounds like Eglin AFB and others, I don't see why a secret aircraft would fly directly over I-10 or get dangerously close to other landing airplanes, that is not very inconspicuous, or top secret either. That leaves ball lightning or swamp gas, and I have never heard of s! uch phenomenon appearing as our sighting did. But I am not an ! expert. I grew up in the area, my father was a Navy pilot and flight instructor, and my time in Civil Air Patrol years ago has provided experience around many civilian and military airplanes.  We do not have photos, or video, I think even if we had such equipment at the time, we were too dumbfounded to even use such devices.  I will send in drawings/renderings that have been made since.  Not much help but a picture says a thousand words.",2011-08-21T00:00:00,30.462935377358487,-87.26545408805032

First we spotted an huge orange/yellow burning ball, looked exactly like picture we see of our burning sun, this UFO was stationary and hung  in the dark sky over  a ravine when we first saw it. Next it changed slowly become a dark red glowing ember colored orb with dark lines, then it began to close up on its self  and went from a burning sun/orb to a small bright bright luminescent  light which zipped all over the night sky, instantly changing from a bright bright light to burning sun/orb then back to bright white light. This went on for a couple of hours, we were so fascinated we didn’t notice the time  Then it landed on the hill side across the ravine from our position in Fricote City (which lays on a hill top).  We were so excited we watched for hours. After the UFO landed across the way from us, it continued to change from Orange/Yellow burning sun to bright bright light and we started to worry it would start a fire in the dry grass it had landed on, although each time it became a bright light or Orange sun you could see the outline or shadows of the Oak trees in that were in between us and  of the UFO. We continued to watch the UFO until about 11p then I became very very sleepy, then my brother turns to me and tells me he can hardly keep his eyes open either so we go to bed   awaken at day break to the sound of jet engines to find the Air Force and Army Choppers, there were military jeeps and men and others in same place we watched the UFO land the night before.

We lived along a backwater area full of trees that separated us from rte 231.  My wife, two kids, and I saw a black boomerang shaped craft move northward, silently in a very controlled straight line just along the tree tops at about as fast as a person would walk, actually caressing the tree tops on the eastern side of 231. It was still light out though heading into twilight. It then stopped about 40 feet from our house (just on the other side of the adjacent street) and hovered motionless for maybe 2 minutes, like it was parked. We watched it from our back porch.  I have 20 20 vision, and could see that there were fairly sharp angled surfaces that appeared to have a rough surface similar to velcro. This much reminded me of some known stealth technology, however there was no sign of any means of propulsion. It was about 40 or 50 feet across (wingspan) and about only 4 feet in heig! ht, not high enough for someone to stand, or hardly even sit - if it were manned a person would probably have to be lying down. I was trying to image how it was being flown.  Maybe it was unmanned?  There were no motors and no jets, no sound or light coming from it. It was all black. I told my wife to run in and get the video camera, and as she went in, it moved straight upward several thousand feet within a minute or two, by the time she returned. We turned on the video camera and captured about 30 seconds of video before the battery died, but by then it was thousands of feet up and it looks like some little black boomerang in the sky (and as a jet liner files past it, probably a few thousand feet above it, it flexed one of its wings while the other remained more or less stationary). Then it kept rising until it was out of sight. Having seen it up close I know it was not a balloon or some inflated thing, though it was apparently flexible to some extent. It was quite solid ap! pearing when close up. My 7 year old son actually exclaimed ""m! aybe the re are aliens inside!"". I laughed a little nervously said, ""maybe, who knows?"". At first I thought it might be one of ours, but I didn't think it would be very typical for a top secret ultra high tech craft to be flying around close to the ground in a residential neighborhood? Unfortunately I don't still have my video - I gave it to a friend where I used to work who was a 'ufo enthusiast' and who told me he had seen many ufos while living in Arizona as a kid. He had told me he had seen many spherical colored objects flying over their neighborhood at several thousand feet in broad daylight, often being chased by jets (in the 60s?).

I believe the objects I saw were beyond the earths atmosphere.  It was like watching a satellite move across the sky, but at an unimaginable speed.  Both objects made a streak of light while lit that made approximately a 15 degree arc.  These objects are the fastest moving objects I have ever viewed in the sky. I’ve seen dead satellites track through the sky before as they blink from the sunlight hitting them while spinning out of control.  I’ve also watched many satellites as they track across the sky.  This is nothing like what I’ve seen before.  I wouldn’t have even thought of reporting this observation, if I had only seen one object, but because I saw another in the same exact path, it struck me as being extremely odd.",2011-08-07T00:00:00,43.4943,-88.54730000000002

I instantly posted to my facebook asking if anyome else happened to see it and infact so far 2 people have reported seeing it.  It was about 6 average stars width in diameter.  It was descending at about a 30 deg angle heading what looked like due north and sank behind the rooftops and I lost sight of it.   One of my friends who replied to my status update said they were walking along the beach and their bf saw it but she did not. I am not discounting a meteor but it was moving very slowly and had golden fire emiting from it evenly in all directions and had a tail that looked more like a rocket flame than a normal meteor.  It should be noted I have seen a meteor crash to earth before (within 1000 feet...i know pretty cool right?) and this just struck me as odd. oddities.... the flames were omnidirectional coming out of the object...not burning off to the back like something burning up as it travels through the atmosphere. it had a vibrant gold color to it...flames...ball...tail...everything was gold  it was moving entirely too slowly. it all happened within about 2-3 seconds but it etched itself into my mind. a minute later as i got on my train i saw a police chopper flying by the beaches doing their patrol but who knows what that could have been because they are often there.

The bay is about 400 meters across with 40-50 foot trees on either side.  I noticed a small red dot pop straight up on the horizon from the west-southwest that was not blinking, but thought nothing of it, believing it was just a plane.  It was like a small red star or just the light of a plane.  It appeared to be a plane miles away, and it appeared to be about 20 degrees above the horizon, or a few degrees above the trees. I noticed it started to wiggle left and right and I figured it must have been closer than I thought and might fly over the bay soon.  I mentioned it to my friend and he looked up and saw it wasn't doing anything, so he ignored it. The red dot hung in the same position for about 2 minutes, and then suddenly it changed color from red to orange.  This got our attention.  A few seconds later, it appeared to become 40 times the size as before, like 40 times the size of a bright star, or 1/4th the size of a full moon in the sky, appearing to travel miles closer to us almost instantaneously.  It looked like a small sun at sunset due to its orange color.   In this same second, it traveled a short distance so rapidly to the right (north) that it appeared to blur the whole distance, and then in the next second it appeared to travel back from where it came from (west-southwest) and became a small red dot the same size it was when it first appeared, and then about a second later it became a very tiny dot and a second later was completely gone.  It appeared to do this just above and beyond the trees on the other side of the bay. My friend stood up from where he was sitting in shock gasping for breath because he was in such disbelief. He had the wind knocked out of him.  I just sat there in disbelief.  The object was so bright the dot was still in his eyes, although I don't believe I experienced that effect.

I live in the flight path of departing aircraft in LAS (Las Vegas) and watch commercial aircraft quite a bit and see at times the International space station pass over.   It is fun to see such a marvel. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Update to Earlier Report this evening This is a follow up to the contents below:  After I was contacted by an investigator last night and it was explained to me that what I saw was possibly a Blimp.  This is plausible although I do not live in North Las Vegas where the N Las Vegas Airport is and is known to have blimps there. I was asked to contact the FSS at Las Vegas and since I do not have a phone book at my home, I went on line and was given some phone numbers but it was not the FSS so after half an hour, I looked at the facts below and wrote this off as a blimp which makes sense.  I am satisfied with that because a that could explain why it was running dark and the light configuration was not your typical fixed winged aircraft and the low humming sound I heard. Believe me when I say I do not normally do this and was not looking to cause any problems. Thank you for responding so quickly. What I originally wrote: I was in my backyard at 1823 when I heard a low hum (not a commercial aircraft engine type or helicopter) and looked towards the NW and saw a green light (like an aircraft on its right wing) approaching and I looked for the red element which would indicate the edge wing.

I saw something unusual in the sky while letting my dog out to urinate at 5:00 in the morning on September 29, 2011.  I was the only person in my house to see it see it, but I am reporting it in hopes that maybe someone else saw it too and can corroborate what I saw. Because I was a bit afraid of what I saw, I did take a picture. I just rushed my dog back in the house, locked my door, and got back in to bed close to my spouse. In retrospect I wish I would have taken a picture so that I would have some proof of what I saw, but the thing really creeped me out and I did not want to even look at it again. I live across the street from the beach. From my front yard, looking southwest, there was a big, bright light in the sky. The sky was very clear and the morning was very quiet.  The light I saw is the brightest thing I have ever seen, except for the sun. It was so bright and seemed to be bluish-white in color. It was brighter than the moon. I don’t think that it was as bright as the sun because it did not hurt my eyes to look at it. It wasn’t a glowing light and it wasn’t blurry, just clear and bright white light. The light did not move and distance or make any noise at all. The shape of the light was like a vertically-oriented oval. At one point the light shifted from being an oval shape to being a crescent shape and then back again to an oval or round shape. It appeared to be very large in the sky. From the ground it did not look as big as the moon, but it looked way bigger than stars or planes look. Because the light seems strange to me, I started trying to figure out what it was. I know that is was not the moon because it was too bright and didn’t have that glowing, reflective quality of the moon.  It also did not have any of the man-on-the- moon shapes on it.  It was just a solid bright light. I know it was not a helicopter because it did not make any noise or have to typical little lights that helicopters have. I know it was not a plane because it did not move or go anywhere.  I know it was not a street light because the lights in my neighborhood are orange colored and this was much higher. I know it was not a meteor because it did not move.  I know it was not a star because it was too big and because there is usually too much light pollution in Long Beach to really see starts clearly. I know it wasn’t a planet because it was too big.  I also know that I was not dreaming this because I stayed awake after putting my dog out.  I know it was not a blimp because it was vertic! ally oriented and did not move. I of course know it was not a bird because it was a bright light. I know it was not a flare because flares fall and leave a smoke trail that you can see in the dark.  I know it was not a firework, because it did not fall of make noise. And I know it was not a spotlight or lighthouse light because it was far too bright.  I know it was not from a boar because it was too high up in the sky.  I know it was not a light on a tall building because there are not any tall buildings over the ocean. Maybe this was a piece of the NASA space shuttle still falling down? I don't know.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,33.79002328838174,-118.17310534232365

Hi Peter, I'm bored at the office today as things are a little slow and stumbled upon my ""ufo pics"".  Anyway, I thought I would send them out to several people to see if anyone could be of any help.  I just wish I could zoom in with today's technology I'm sure someone might be able to see some detail with these. Any how yes I'm saying that this is what I shot for a photo and I believe to be a UFO.  I would fill out your form but I want to be taken seriously and not ((deleted)).  I can’t believe what I saw and I will give you all my info here from my email.  If you really need my info then I will do it. This is how it went.  January 1, 2010 my wife and I, and 2 of my good friends rented a room in New Hampshire at the Loon Mountain Ski club on the second floor of the building.   We had a balcony off our room over looking the Kangamangus Highway.  It was New Year’s night at about 10:00 pm.  I was out on my balcony by myself at first and when I saw this object of a bright whitish some what red color it was round in shape. I slammed on the glass slider to my wife and friends to grab a camera.  They came out so fast I almost went over the balcony.  My wife had the video camera and my friend ((female name deleted)) had the still camera.   From there the object slowly came from over the mountain top towards our hotel.  It gracefully made a left hand turn towards Rt. 93 which is a major highway.  It did take about a minute or 2 before it was off in the distance and it seemed to appear and reappear.  Then it was gone.   We went back into our room and I was anxious to see what we had photos and vid! eo of.  It’s amazing that what was taken as a photo and what was on the video and what we saw are all three different object especially when you zoom in.  I was so worked up my eyes watered and I became tingly and numb.   We got so intrigued that we started looking up info about sightings in that area.  We found several occurring on that highway around the same days but different years.  Put it this way, as I right this almost 2 years later it still makes my head go tingly and numb.   Well as for the sound it was 10 pm and it was cloudy and snowing out.  You know how it gets when its snowing you can here a pin drop.  We didn't hear a thing and believe me it was close enough that you would hear at least something.  It was too cloudy for a hot air balloon and 10 at night.  It wasn't a flare because it went for miles.  My uncle is a pilot locally here on the cape and I have been around small planes and helicopter my whole life.  I mean what in the hell flies when it’s snowing and! you can see the ceiling of clouds flying over head.   This has no explanation.",2011-08-21T00:00:00,,

I was in the process of picking up a load in the middle of a cotton field at approximately 10:15pm central time. As I was walking around checking all of the valves on the tanks, I happened to notice a brilliant red light in the sky.  At first I thought it was a plane but as I watched I realized the light was stationary.  It was approximately 1/2 mile from my location and approximately 1000 ft off the ground.  This lasted for about 2 minutes before 2 more lights appeared slightly higher in the sky and slightly to the left.  These were yellowish orange color. The lights just faded in till they reached there brightest point.  At this time the red light faded out at the same rate as the 2light yellowish lights appeared.  As soon as the red light had disappeared completely, 2 more yellowish orange lights appeared slightly higher up and to the left of the already visible yellowish lights.  This time as soon as the li! ghts reached the brightest point, the previous 2 yellowish lights faded out just as the red light had done.  The first 2 lights were on approximately 2 seconds before the next 2 lights became to show up.  Once the second set of yellowish lights were on for approximately 2 seconds they faded out at the same rate they came on.  The sky was then dark for about 10 seconds before the red light came back on.  Fading in just as the other lights had done. Then the pattern continued at random intervals for the remainder of the event.  I tried to capture video as well as pictures.  Every time I placed the camera up to take a picture the lights would not come on. As soon as I put the camera back in my truck, the lights returned.  The field I was in while viewing this is completely flat with no trees to block my view.  The night was completely clear with no clouds, had a light breeze, but cannot remember what phase the moon was in.

It came to a slow stop and dangled there in the sky just dangling there over the house I came up to it still driving and rolled down my window to hear if it had some kind of sound it did not have any sound it was flat in the front and back I could see the back because it was very low and while it dangled it moved very slowly from left to right.

It moved as to scope the area out left to r! ight very slowly.

I immediatley got out ran inside and woke up my family and begged them to believe me and go with me to see if they could see it,as I explained that I think it landed behind the houses in the empty lot or the lot behind walmart it took me a minute to persuade them so one family member said they would go.

It has been bothering me so I decided to contact your website. I did however report it to the marines here in my town but I never received a call back. Another one of my family member believe they saw the same thing but we can't be sure. If the base has some kind of probe scouting between the hours of 2:00am and 4:00 am they should let the community know so we may have some clarity on what we saw. It was moving very fast when I first noticed it, It was coming from southeast and just all of a sudden changed direction to west.I could not tell if I was moving or the object was moving until I came to the stop sign. It came to a sudden stop after moving terribly fast and just immediately opened up into the diamond shape. Thank You, Can you help?  In case your wondering I was coming home from graveyard shift when I saw this. I can get my schedule so I can verify the time.",2011-08-21T00:00:00,32.7038626459144,-114.59088443579766

My boyfriend and I went out for a smoke on the balcony around 12:19 am.  My boyfriend was looking up at the night’s sky and pointed out this unknown object in the sky.   At first we thought it was a satellite, then noticed that there were 3 white lights really close together flashing, and a bit of red was also flashing in the center of the 3 white lights.  We thought it could have been a plane but the movement of the object was strange.  It would move slowly diagonally and sit there in the sky a bit and then it moved back to where it was before repeating this movement several times, but sometimes in the opposite direction. That’s when we decided to go and grab the camera and snap some photos.  It was hard to take a picture of the object, half the time it wouldn’t appear on the camera.  Our roommate came home and we asked him if he saw it too and what he thought of it.  He wasn’t too sure all he said he knew it wasn’t a plane because of the positioning of the lights and thought it wasn’t a satellite because of the red flashing light. Half hour later we went inside to look at the pictures we managed to take.  When we zoomed in on the picture a green light located above the red light appeared looking as if it were attached. When looking from the patio the green light wasn’t noticeable.  After viewing the picture we went back out to see if it was still there. Luckily, it was and we took a few more pictures.  We zoomed in on another picture and this time when we zoomed in on the picture the green light wasn’t there but the red was still present.  Instead of being an oval/circular shape, it was in the shape of a disk on an angle with the red light on top of this disk. We have never noticed this object in the night’s sky before.  Tomorrow night we will be going back out onto the patio at the same time to see if it is still there.",2011-08-07T00:00:00,56.709216753926704,-111.28710209424085

After about 5-6 minutes there was more reddish orange color and the object went straight down about 1/2"".....(This measurement is the best I can come up with because I have no way of estimating distance.  Our viewing was from the West side of the city, looking West). This object continued to glow and remained in this position for about 5-6 minutes...then all of a sudden it projected left horizontally about another 1/2"" and remained in this position for a few minutes. We continued watching, mesmerized and wondering just, ""what is it???""  for about 30-35 minutes.  During this time its position changed several times from straight up or straight down, horizontal either left or right, until it went straight down below the horizon and we could no longer see it.   We continued looking West for a few minutes, wondering if we'd see it come 'up' again, but it didn't.",2011-08-21T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

I was standing in a crop formation north of Milton, when all of a sudden I looked up and noticed a super bright light to the north west of my position. The light was circular and moving slowly from west to east. It was difficult to determine distance, height and speed, but it wasn’t really close or too high. I’d guess that it was at least a mile away, probably more, and that the altitude was somewhere around 3,000 feet. I could not distinguish a shape to anything that the light was connected to, nor could I hear any unusual noises. The light was very strange, in that it did not project very far from whatever it was attached to. The only thing that comes to mind is consider the shape of a hockey puck. Stand the puck on its end so that the flat sides are going left to right. Then turn the black rubber into intense white light. This was the shape of the light moving forward. The relationship of the width of the circle to the depth that the light projected was about the same as that of a hockey puck standing on its edge. When the light was almost due north of my position, it overtook what was obviously a small plane. The small plane had normal lights, and my guess is that it was heading to Brampton Airport. I could be wrong about this, but from my position, that was the direction it was heading in. I would guess the small plane was flying at approx 2000 feet. The bright light was half again as high as the small plane. This is why I estimate it to be around 3,000 feet.  If the small plane was cruising at 150MPH, the I would estimate that the bright light was doing maybe 160 or 170mph. It wasn’t screaming through the sky, it was taking it’s time. It overtook the small plane and kept on going. The bright light never deviated on its altitude. As the bright light moved more to the east at a certain point I could no longer see the light itself... it was just a glow continuing to the east. When the light was at the far eastern horizon, it was very feint.  It was on a path that took it  north of Pearson International Airport. The total length of time the bright light was in view was between 7 and 10 minutes. There is another NUFORC report for this same evening from Kingston, Ontario.  A couple reported a bright light attached to a triangle shaped craft, and there was a strange rumbling sound heard.  Their report was at 11:10pm. Kingston is a 2.5 hour drive from Milton.  I believe that these two reports are talking about the same unusual light and craft, from 2 different vantage points, and 2 different times.",2012-01-24T00:00:00,43.513051704545454,-79.88477670454546

I can also not recall the time, although am fairly certain that it was between 10:00 PM and 2:00 AM.  I had gone outside to make a trip to the nearby 7-11 and had noticed how remarkably crisp and clear the night was with the stars very visable. I decided upon returning to go and sit outside for awhile and stargaze.   I got out a lawn chair and before I could even sit down noticed an object directly above me. It was a disk-like glowing amber light flying from directly overhead to my 11 o'clock disappearing over the roof of my house to the north.  I then noticed another object just like the first to my 3 o'clock flying south/ southeast which disappeared from sight behind the tree line.  Both objects emitted a steady muted amber glow and flew at a constant velocity similar to the speed of a commercial airliner. The height of the objects was indeterminate.  There were no flashing lights.  Each object was roughly 1/8 the size of the full moon.",2011-08-21T00:00:00,41.5212,-90.3858

First of all. I do not want any publicity at all.  I am a 56 year old business professional.  At a family wedding the photographer was taking some infared pictures that bothered him greatly.  I am the last in our family to have the picture but have sent it to multiple friends around the country for use if anything happens to me.  The picture itself shows long and circular vapor trails going around a tree and stopping right in front of the church.  There is an insect or fish looking thing in fron to another tree.  Upon close inspection, I was stunned to notice what looks like a disc trying to be invisible above the church.  My son reversed the picture on microsoft paint when the details became much clearer. The scary part is that whenever I was traveling (by air for business) with the picture I kept running into people that were related to the history of these objects.  First I met a relative of James Forrestal that told me a frightening story, then a nephew of a guy by the name of ((last name deleted)) who again told me a frightening story.(said his relative's first name was ((first name deleted)) and he was ((deleted--with a military unit)) in New Mexico in 1947)   The event that really affected me was sitting next to two Wright Patterson civilian scientists with creditials that went crazy when they saw the picture. They claimed that they had never seen everything in one picture.  The first question they asked was are you running into people with interest in the same subject matter.  I said yes and they then suggested some rules that I should live by whenever I carry the picture.  The conversation went on for over an hour and I have never traveled with the picture again.   Also met a DOD guy that began talking about the subject matter and was insistent that I send him a copy of the picture which I never did.  I have no idea what is going on but I just can't get all of this out of my mind.    By the way, the Wright Patt people shared that they work on cloaking.  I had recently seen an old movie called the Philadelphia Experiment and I asked them if cloaking was anything like that movie and they said yes, do you think we stopped there?  They also suggested that I should not trust anyone in the public eye regarding this subject matter.   I never wanted any of this and quite frankly didn't believe any of the hype but gentlemen, something is happening to me with this nonsense and I just can't put it out of my mind.   Can you help me with all of this?   I will show you the picture if you like.  In case you are wondering, I have never seen one of these things myself that I know of?  Thank you for your time and I really hope that you can help me.  I would be extremely happy to be convinced that it is a camera problem but I still can't explain the people I kept meeting.",2012-01-24T00:00:00,40.8684,-82.3149

Saw 2 or 3 more orange light spheres rise up in the air.    Third thought was weather balloons, or maybe glowing kites, but then the spheres rose up higher, some faster than the others, all moving up but not in a uniform direction.   The spheres then moved south towards Pacifica and disappeared.

The other post mentions being over by 24th St which is high on a hill but far from Golden Gate Park/Ocean Beach.  They saw three but I think it was due to the distance; I was much closer and the lights were closer to the ground, also lots of tall houses/buildings in that area.

We had been moving into our new house all day and after being completely exhausted, we decided to just go to bed and hang up the curtains the next morning.  We have a large, beautiful window in our bedroom which looks out to the mountains.  On this night we were lying in the dark on the bed on our stomachs enjoying the night sky and talking.  I would say it was almost one a.m. As we were looking towards the mountains we saw three lights in a horizontal row in the sky. White in color, fairly large and round.   Could tell that the lights were attached to some sort of a triangular craft.  The lights didn’t blink or change color.  The placement of the lights did move on the structure.  Three lights on the bottom, the middle light went out and re-appeared on the top so that the three lights formed a triangle.  Then the top light went out, moved back to the bottom and two additional white lights appeared on the bottom for a total of five. It was big but not very close. My husband and I were shocked and speechless.  We jumped out of bed  and ran outside to see if we could get a better look.  The craft wasn’t moving, it was at a standstill in the night sky and it was eerily quiet outside.  There were no blinking lights, no red lights or blue.  It wasn’t an airplane because it wasn’t moving.  It just hovered with us staring at it for about ten minutes and then it started floating away slowly and then before we knew it, it zoomed out into the night sky.  It was shocking and unbelievable.  We had heard of the Phoenix lights before but we were always skeptical.  We have since talked to several people who have said they have experienced strange sightings while camping in the mountains and out where we have lived.  I don’t know what it was in the sky that night, all I can say is that it was strange, foreign and bone-chilling.",2011-08-21T00:00:00,33.60335555555556,-110.71592222222222

We were traveling in our car south on Highway 99 from Fresno toward Visalia.  There was a cloud cover and I looked out my right side window ( West) and noticed some dancing white lights.  At first I thought it was a spot light being shown up into the sky, perhaps to attract people to a Black Friday shopping location.  However, there weren't any stores near where this was occurring.  I kept watching them while my husband was driving. The lights were moving in a very distinct and exact pattern.  There were four of them.  They were in a circle and they would rotate perfectly to the left about 90 degrees and then they all converged and meet as one in the middle of this circle.  Then they would move back out to the perimeter of the circle, rotate to the left,  then once again converge to the middle and start over again. I say circle because although I could not see anything but the lights, the pattern they moved in was a circle.  Each of the 4 lights was the same size and they were softened by the cloud cover between the  actual light and us. This changing of the pattern was constant and occurred several times each minute. It was as though they were on the outer edges of a round object, would rotate 1/4 way around the object, all come back to the middle of the object, then return to the outer edges.  I remarked to my husband that it looked like the lights were doing a square dance. The precision that they moved in was completely consistent every time. Then, as we traveled down the highway the lights stayed right with us along the highway, traveling just west of us but staying with us,  I mentioned this to my husband, and he saw them as well. We had traveled at least ten miles since I first noticed them, but they stayed right with us. This really had our attention.  We took the off ramp to exit the highway and stopped at the top of the ramp as there was no traffic behind us. We watched the lights travel and stop right in front of us, (up in the sky of course) and hover there and the lights never wavered from their moving pattern, It kind of freaked me out that they stopped and hovered there as we stopped at the top of the ramp. We turned left and traveled three or four miles north to the road where we live, which is a state highway. The lights stayed above us and to the right of us, but definitely with us.  We got to our road, and I was really feeling some anxiety. We turned left and traveled about 3/4 of a mile to our ranch and I couldn't see them behind us.  I was relieved! We had to hang a u turn to get into our driveway, and there were those 4 lights, hovering just off our driveway, right next to our house.  We rolled down the windows to try to hear anything, but there was complete silence.  I thought several crazy thoughts because it was very weird.  I felt like whatever it was knew I had noticed it and decided to follow us.  I was freaked out and got into the house as quickly as possible.  My husband had to go check on the livestock and said it was still out there when he came in. I called the sheriff's office this morning and no reports of any lights came in from anyone, but they gave me the information to contact you, so this is what we saw. My husband is a rancher and farmer, has been in business over 50 years I am a retired business owner, serve on several boards and am very active in the community. ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising light.

It moved faster than any aircraft I have ever seen and I have been to air shows and after 911 there were several fly-byes from military craft and all of those made a lot of sound.   In addition it was very low to the ground and seemed to be not too much higher than the homes nearby, it was gone out of sight in no time at all.

I decided to walk my dog before work as she was beginning to dig a lot of holes around the lawns and such so I thought that if I started doing this, it would calm her down a bit from doing these things. It is still dark when I wake up so I decided to grab a torch and go with her then which is usually around 05:30 - 06:00 am.  As I walked along my local road which is a small road and very quiet, I noticed a red flashing light going across the sky which also changed to a yellow flashing light in quick succession.  At first I thought that this was a plane going across and carried on but still glanced up at it as I walked. I soon noticed that this object, whatever it was, was flying in strange flight paths as it moved up and down and also went faster and slower, like it was hovering in the air.  I was amazed to see this as I could hear no sound to prove that it could be a helicopter.  I carried on focusing on it and as I had a torch with me, I pointed it towards this and flashed the torch by turning it on and off just out of curiosity. Suddenly the strange lights just dis-appeared on me.  I carried on with the walk wondering to myself what it might be. As I had walked about a mile, I decided to turn back and head for home. About halfway back I noticed it again but in a different area of the sky doing the same thing, just hovering across the sky and stopping for a couple of seconds, turning to go the other way and then turning back the way it was going and moving on only to dis-appear again. When I got home I looked again and just over my village, I noticed a white light about the same size of a star in the sky but much lower and it was hovering over the village itself going back and forward and up and down. This amazed me so I said to myself to do the same the next morning to see if I would see it again and to my surprise I did!! It was the same lights, yellow, red and white changing to each colour quickly like they were going round in a circle. I had my camera this time but as soon as my flash went off these lights dis-appeared again and  nothing showed up on my camera.  I focused up on the sky looking around to see if I could find it.It was an overcast sky as rain was due to fall later that morning but yet I could see the stars. As I looked closely around the stars, I noticed that these so called stars were moving in different places, some moving fast accross the sky and stopping and others slowly, sometimes just dis-appearing. I found this so unexplainable and in between all these white lights in the sky the flashing red,yellow and white object appeared, going across the sky hovering up and down slowly as though it was examining the area( that's what it seemed like to me).  I grew really interested in all this especially because what I believed was stars were moving around also! The next morning I decided to go out earlier and was out at about 4:30 am with my camera and decided to just take random pictures one after another and see what I can pick up at the end of it all.  Over a period of 2 mornings, today and yesterday morning I took a total of 230 pictures and some that I caught were very interesting.  I caught one or two that I simply cannot explain and would be willing to share them with you if you would like to hear from me further on this matter.  That is basically all for now. If you want to hear from me then that is okay by me. Upto now I was very skeptical about all this but as of now, my mind is in two places as to what is going on around here in the night sky.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,,

My family and I were staying at the Mariott Resort and Spa last week. It was a partly cloudy night but stars were still visible.  It was very windy too. It was almost dark when we were eating dinner outside and at about 9 PM we all (4 adults) noticed three faint orange lights in the sky in a triangular shape.  We all thought they were planets or satellites at first because they stood out among the stars and did not flicker.  They continued to grow bigger and brighter and the orange color became much more clear.  At first they appeared to be stationary (on a very windy night) but then appeared to be moving very slowly along the coast.  They stayed in perfect formation but dimmed and grew brighter and dimmed again.  At one point, they looked like bright orange spheres in the sky and appeared far bigger than any stars that were visible.  They were not flashing lights and there were no other colors visible- just orange.  There was no sound from whatever this was.  I walk ed up to my room about 30 minutes later when the lights looked like glowing basketballs in the sky and took my husband (who had returned to the room before me) to the balcony to see how bright they had gotten and they were gone.  The whole incident lasted about 30 minutes. I asked some of the hotel staff about what we saw the following morning and they all looked at me like I was nuts.  I can't find anything on the Internet about others seeing these lights and am very curious to find out what they were.  So mad I didn't take a picture. I thought about it later when I actually considered the possibility of being a UFO (never given this topic much thought).  I did find several pictures on the Internet that look like what we saw though. ((NUFORC Note:  This report originally was posted for the State of Ohio, but Hilton Head Island is in South Carolina.

It was a dark and very clear night with the stars, highly visible.  I was about 2 miles south of the Elkton/Sinai, SD exit and came upon a slower car which I decided to pass.  Before passing, I happened to look up through my windshield and noticed a bright, white, light to the north about the size of a quarter.  My first thought was that it was a plane with his landing lights on heading for the Sioux Falls Regional Airport about 40 miles to the south.  I did not see any of the usual strobes on this light and thought that was a little strange but, assumed that it was coming straight south and maybe I just couldn't see them from my position. I passed this car and a little way ahead was another car going much slower than the one that I had just passed. I looked again, before passing to see if the light was still there.  It was but, had grown to about the size of a half dollar and still, I could see no strobes such as aircraft have. I was pretty interested in the light now but, was next to the car I was passing and sped up so I could have a good look at the light. In the matter of seconds that it took to fully pass the car and get back in the driving lane, when I looked up again, the white light had gone from the size of a half dollar to the size of a dime.  I turned my attention to the road as I had road construction coming up, then, looked up again.  To my amazement, the light had shrunk to the size of a star and then, it was just suddenly gone. The whole thing couldn't have taken more than 45 seconds.  I was fascinated that it had gone from the size of a quarter to half dollar, then to the size of a dime, a star and then just gone, just like that.

But that didn’t explain why it moved so slow? Just as we were discussing what we saw another huge bright orange orb was glowing in the southern sky. My dad said it came from the same direction as the one we just saw. It rose right above the tree line and continued to climb into the sky.

Three more bright lights appeared overhead and moved upwards, left and right until either settling in a fixed position or slowly continuing in their direction.

I am an amateur astronomer and since last night (2/26/12) was the first clear night since buying a new binocular; I decided to go outside and star test them. I was on the back deck looking west.  Because of trees,  I can look straight overhead, a little bit to the west, and a little bit to the east. Jupiter and the Moon were westward as was Venus closer to the horizon. To the SSW high in the sky was M45 the Pleiades open cluster. At one point, I would estimate that it was about 7:18 or 19PM; I was sweeping the sky just west of the zenith, when I caught sight of an airliner - probably a  Boeing 747 or maybe an Airbus A380 because it had 4 engines on the wing cruise climbing almost directly in a western direction (more later).  I could see a lot of detail including the wing tip lights, strobe light on the belly - it was lit up very well. As I was tracking this airliner heading west; a silent, brownish, rectangular (about 5 or 6 times wide as it was long - flying wingish but with no appearent taper to the ‘wings’) craft flew underneath this airliner going about 15 degrees more northward but still on a westerly course.  It crossed the airliner's course in a shallow X.  It is hard to judge its speed - a lot depends upon its actual altitude - but its appearent speed seemed a lot faster.  I tracked this new craft for maybe another second or so, then it disappeared behind some trees. On the Enroute L-28 chart, there is a marked airway that goes directly over where I live simply marked 281 between Detroit Wayne County VOR and HARWL intersection which confirms that the airliner was below 18,000 feet, and this UFO was somewhere below him. Another clue was the fact that this airliner was perfectly in focus, but this UFO was a little out of focus. It was a light brown in color, rectangular shaped (no taper!), no exhaust seen (it was very clear on the airliner), no lights, silent, flying a straight course, going really fast (left the airliner like it was standing still). This is a purely visual report by just me.  But, I thought I’d report it anyway.  Just in case somebody else seen it, or maybe somebody else on that airliner made a report of it.",2012-03-13T00:00:00,42.28027533875339,-83.73625456187895

We are located about 30 miles northeast of Charleston, SC. On the evening of September, 29, 2011 at around 9:20 in the evening, on a very clear night with no moon in the sky, my wife and I witnessed some events that seemed to correspond to each other.  As we looked from our driveway to the north, which would be towards St. Stephen, there was nothing in the sky.  As we turned to go inside I happened to turn back and saw about 10 to 12 blinking lights.  Their location was in the sky at a NNE direction about 45 degrees up.  They had the illumination somewhat brighter than a normal star.  We hurried to the fence, away from the main road so as not to be hampered in our viewing by any traffic that may come toward us on the highway. As we watched them in a group, a falling star was witnessed by both of us.  It was larger and slower than a regular slit of a glimpse a usual falling star gives you and had a long tail that was orange in color and much wider than a regular meteorite.  Its trajectory was about 90 degrees when we spotted it and went to about 30 degrees before it disappeared.  It was traveling from south to north.  Whatever fell through the sky seemed to dissect the blinking lights.   It was almost as if they were signaling for something to come in.  Then they broke apart in formation with about 8 heading towards the coast, which would be towards the east and four heading towards the west, above and to the north of Lake Moultrie which is towards our west.  We followed those lights because the other 8 would have been obstructed quickly from view because of a forest to the east of our viewing position.   After the four blinking lights heading towards Lake Moultrie went out of site, less than a mi! nute passed and we suddenly saw two Air Force jets at full throttle heading in the direction of the four that had just flown out of sight.  We definitely heard the two jets with afterburners at full thrust.  We never heard anything when it was just the 10 to 12 blinking lights in the sky.   The jets were coming from SSE which is the direction of Charleston’s Air Force base and flying rapidly towards the NNW.  After the jets went out of sight and sound, we looked back to the original spot in the sky where we had seen the original lights blinking, and we saw another falling star, exactly like the one I explained falling in exactly the same area we had seen the first one.   Immediately following that, I was looking off in a westerly direction towards Lake Moultrie when my wife exclaimed that she saw another falling star streaking towards where the four blinking lights had headed off towards Lake Moultrie.  That one was about 20 degrees in the sky heading from the north when she saw it towards the north- north east.  The entire episode lasted for a total of about twenty minutes ending between 9:40 to 9:45 pm, Eastern Standard Time.",2011-10-10T00:00:00,33.357,-79.8687

The object was triangular in shape with three solid, what appeared as white round lights, at each tip.  The object itself wasn’t visible, but appeared to blend in with the night sky.  Had it not been for the lights on the object, I most likely would not have noticed it.  I estimate that the object was visible for approximately 30 seconds before it disappeared over the horizon.  I also noticed that it traveled at a consistent rate of speed. I am willing to answer any follow up questions that anyone may regarding this sighting.  My contact information is as follows.  I would prefer contact via email, but will conduct a phone interview if needed.",2011-08-21T00:00:00,31.045,-97.50869999999999

While my wife was in the car she was looking at the sky and started to see a black sphere and called me to come from in front of the car and to look up,  when I looked up I see a black sphere and I'm telling my son to go and get his binoculars and when he came back he said he can't find them so he brought his sister's I-pod touch and I started to take pictures.   I then started to take video but I was having trouble seeing the sphere on the I-pod so I pointed the I-pod to were it was the last time I saw it and started to record.  We saw the black sphere for about seven to nine minutes it moved sideways, up, down, and would also stay in place for a minute and take off.  After it disappeared we heard in the back round military jets going to were the black sphere were. I came inside my house and started to see the pictures and the videos put the screen was to small to see anything so I downloaded it to my computer and started to darken the color of the pictures to see it better and I started to see white spheres on the pictures so I started to see the videos that I took and the same thing the white spheres were there too.  Then I converted the three minute video to one hour and twenty minutes and also adjusted the lighting and when I played it back it shocked me and scared me because the white spheres where going in and out of the clouds and some even left a trail when they came out from the clouds.    they are different sizes and they are more than thirty or forty spheres and they move so fast and if you go frame by frame you can see them going in and out and some stop and you can see that they are white round spheres.  I was in shock how many they are and how fast they move and also how they used the cloud to hide and to me they manipulated the clouds shape so they could move to another place.  si! nce that day I feel confused and also have a hard time concent! rating o r focusing on things I feel lost and the more I see the videos the more start to wonder why so many of them? and what were they doing or looking for?

Our plan that night was to go out on the boat before dark, (about 8:00) find a spot about 35 miles offshore and fish through the night there.  We expected to return the next morning.  The waves were much rougher than they were supposed to be so I got very sick and slept and the cushion in the front of the boat.  My dad also became sea sick but he kept fishing making it even worse to the point that we decided to return early. As we were pulling up to our dock at about 2:15 in the morning I was getting the ropes ready and my dad was driving so we were not looking at the sky.  My uncle then said “what is that?” and pointed to the sky, when we looked up we saw an object that appeared to be on fire.  I thought the object was a plane about to crash but I soon noticed that it was not.  I could see that the top of the object looked like a large isosceles triangle pointing upward and the bottom looked like a small equilateral triangle pointing downward.  I was very interested in the object so I watched and after a few minutes my father and uncle dismissed it and began unloading the boat.  As I continued to watch the object it went from the bright flaming orange color to a darker yellow color as it got smaller this looked to me like it was going farther away.  The object retained its shape as it got smaller. The object made no sound the whole time.  I then watched it go across the sky from the left to the r! ight at a very high speed then immediately stop, hover in place for about 2 seconds then completely disappear.  Then we saw nothing more of the object.

The time was around 11:00 PM.  I looked out my bedroom window because I thought I heard a car idling at the corner of the nearest cross-street. There was no car, but I looked up toward the northwest and saw three fuzzy white lights in the sky, much closer and clearer than stars, in a triangle pattern equidistant from each other and moving clockwise in a circle.  Every few seconds they would all come together in the middle of the circle, bounce off each other, then go back out to their original positions and resume moving in a circle.  The sky was mostly clear with a few thin wisps of cloud.  The lights appeared to be between me and the clouds. After about a minute I went into the dining room and looked from that window, and they were still doing the same thing.  After about another minute I went into the livingroom and looked again, and one of the lights was missing, while the other two kept circling and touching, but after a few seconds it came shooting back into the formation from the left (behind a cloud wisp) and the three lights continued to do the circling and touching. I went away from the window for a couple of minutes, then looked again, and they were still there.  I went away from the window for a couple more minutes, then looked out the diningroom window again, and they were gone.  I looked for them again on various nights after this but never saw them again.

The order of the pictures attached here is the series of the 3 that I took with my iphone as I was just trying to get a shot of ""Sisters"" and Mount Jefferson in the Bend area.   As for the pictures, they cannot be a balloon cluster as this thing passed us!!  Look at the lake on the first picture as the object comes from right to left, go to the next shot, it's in frame, look at our relative movement passing the lake then the last shot as the thing is hidden by the wing and our location relative to the lake again. We were cruising at 11,500 ft at approx 200 mph. the balloons would have to be fast!!  That thing was a streak, it went by as nothing but a blur.  Only the luck of the camera could tell me that it was some sort of object of quite some size, as our wing is nearly 50 long and that float out there (40 ft away) is 10 ft long.   I estimate that it is about the same size as our plane or longer, that would make it approximately 70-80 ft long. I would also estimate it to be within 1000 ft of us laterally.  The object made no noise that I could discern, nor did it leave any sort of contrails or exhaust paths.  It appears to be banking around us for a split second then gone.

On Friday, November 11th, 2011, I was traveling south on I-55 from St. Louis, MO, to Galveston, TX. At 11:15 PM, as I was near the border of Missouri and Arkansas, I happened to notice how clear the sky was from my windshield.  I was attracted to the sky mostly due to the number of stars that were so visible. I turned to my driver side window to get a better look and immediately saw three bright lights that looked like large stars in a V formation.  It was clear right away that they were moving in my direction and that they were in our skies as opposed to out in space with the rest of the stars. I’ve seen many planes, helicopters and blimps in the sky and could easily tell that this was not what I was seeing.  There were no blinking lights on these objects; they were just balls of light.  There was kind of an excitement as I thought I may be looking at UFO’s. I had to break my concentration from what I was seeing so that I could watch the highway for a few seconds. The break in concentration was enough to bring me back to reality and I thought that when I looked back I would recognize that they were just airplanes.  When I went back for my next look they were closer and I started to notice other really small lights in a cluster around the original three balls of light. When I noticed how many lights were actually in the sky I thought that I had to be seeing traffic from an airport.  With this in mind I noticed that none of the lights were landing or taking off.  They were all still moving in my direction as if they were going to cross over the highway.  They were coming from the East and moving West as I was traveling South on the highway. About this time, I thought I have to get a picture of this.  I started rolling my driver side window down, steered with my knee and was switching my cell phone to camera with my right hand.  I pointed the phone in the direction of the lights, checked the screen and then snapped a picture.  I didn’t really expect to catch anything, but I checked anyway and noticed I caught three lights. Now, the lights were pretty far over my left shoulder and it was hard to watch them as I was driving.  I started to roll my window up and saw a helicopter flying low to the ground, parallel to the highway, and in the direction of the lights.  I tried to catch the lights in my rear view mirror, but was unable to find them. At this point I was pretty excited and decided to send the picture to a friend and post it to Facebook.  The next couple of hundred miles I was overwhelmed with thoughts and questions and it was all I could think about.  I stopped for the night in Little Rock and immediately opened the picture on my computer so that I could zoom in on it. I was shocked to find a triangle shape made of lights, a green glowing disc, and another light that was cut off because it was out of the frame.  After really examining the green object I noticed that it was reflecting light from above rather than glowing.  You can really see this because the structure of the object is casting shadows.  There are bumps that stick out on the edges and there is a dome exactly centered. I guess I caught the object as well of a trace of the object because of my shutter speed.  I don’t know much about photography so I’m not sure what would cause the object and trace to appear the way they do. I’d guess it would have something to do with the motion or speed that the object was moving.  I didn’t actually see the green object with my own eyes; I only saw different size and colors balls of light. After checking out the image, I Googled ""Memphis UFO"" to see if anyone else had seen the same thing.  It didn’t take long before I found MUFON.  I emailed my picture to the director; I had no idea what else to do with it at the time. Since I’ve had this sighting it’s become a huge part of my life.  The last two months I’ve been obsessed with UFO’s and have watched every documentary, searched the internet, and spent countless hours staring into the sky.  I’ve met other people (young and old) who have witnessed similar things and noticed that it became a major part of their lives as well. I know that we cannot add contact information into the report, but I would love to speak with anyone who has seen something like this.  I’m not sure if there is a way for you to contact me, but if so please do.",2012-01-24T00:00:00,35.6906,-90.0068

DESCRIPTION My daughter and granddaughter had gone out my building’s back door into the alley and called my phone to come out and look. It looked like a burning object, and I thought maybe it was an aircraft or a meteor, but it did not appear to be moving and there was no contrail. Then we saw a big burning piece fall straight down from the main object. This piece was smaller than the main object, left a trail of sparks and embers, and seemed to burn out and disappear before it traveled a quarter of the way from the object toward earth. This happened two or three more times, additional chunks falling in similar fashion from the main object while the main object continued to burn brightly - I say “burn” because it seemed to change shape and flare the way a fire does, and it was bright reddish orange and yellow like flames. DURATION This went on for 2-5 minutes (it is difficult to estimate the time since we were so stunned by this – it was unlike anything we’d ever seen before), and then the main object’s “flame” seemed to suddenly go out, although we could still see the object, now looking like a very dim star. The dim spot remained stationery for another 30 seconds to a minute, then started very slowly moving downward.

I was the first to see it.  It was a bright neon indigo blue orb; it looked as if it literally came out of the sky. It the western side of the sky towards the Pacific Ocean.  It began to fly towards us but then stopped, became a royal blue color and started falling towards land at a ridiculous speed but as it was falling it started to change colors.  It kept changing from a blood red to royal blue back and forth as it fell. The way the colors changed seemed like they morphed into each other. While it was falling it came to an abrupt stop and flew left or south bound. And when it came back up, another orb appeared. This orb was a stunning turquoise color and it would morph into yellow-green but mostly stayed turquoise. Now these two orbs would just fly around in the sky, but not necessarily in the sky but lower than airplanes would. It seemed like they were just playing around with each other because they would fly around in almost a playful manner. Continually morphing into the different colors. The royal blue orb can fly the highest into the air but the turquoise orb could not it would remain lower. Now, on the right side, a white orb began to appear.  It slowly appeared into a bigger white orb. The thing about all the orbs was that they were solids; they looked like they had a core center with a a lighter color aura around them. The lighter color was the same color as the core color regardless of how much it changed colors but it was more translucent. Now, the white orb never moved it stayed perfectly stil, almost just hovering in the air. There was a time when the aura on the white orb became bigger but went back to it original size. The two colorful orbs were playfully flying around in the sky; i noticed they would never get really close to the white orb but will fly around it. There was about 3 air planes that flew by. It seemed as if the two that were coming north bound seen it because they were flying really close to each other like they were scared. Air planes do not normally fly that close to each other. The two colorful obs began to play more vigorously; they were doing trick like going from opposite sides of the sky and flying really fast towards each other like they were going to smash but right before would steer off in opposite directions. Then slowly the two orbs slowly flew towards the white orb and formed a triangle. The triangle stayed in the position for a few minutes. It stayed perfectly stil just hovering in the sky. I believe the white orb represented the 90 degree angle. The royal blue orb was directly north of the white orb and the turquoise orb was left/south of the white orb. After they stopped making the triangle formation, the royal blue and turquoise orb went back to the south/left side of the sky and they continued flying in a circular motion/ figure 8 motion. Then the royal blue flew back north from where it originally came from, the turquoise went back to the left/south side and just disappeared. The white orb slowly faded out. What I noticed was that the positions the orbs came from, though they were very much apart, still formed a triangle. The best way to describe it was like connecting the constellations and it formed a triangle.  We watched for a while but it did not return; we returned about 10 minutes later but they were not there.",2011-12-12T00:00:00,47.29995649484537,-122.18088288659793

I told my girlfriend the light was a planet either Venus or Mars most likely mars because the light was red. She agreed it was a planet because the light was not blinking and the light was larger then all the stars. Anyways, I was excited because I had binoculars in my car and wanted to take a closure look at what I thought was a planet. So I pulled into the driveway got out of the car with my binoculars and the object was gone? We were all baffled, but my girlfriend said “no look its right there”, when I saw the light we realized it was at a different p! osition in the sky, approx. 30 degrees from horizon, I focused on the object through the binoculars and noticed it wasn’t a star or planet. The object was a red sphere split horizontally with a single very bright white light moving right to left (at the split) the object was stationary for maybe ten seconds then the object began to move almost vertical (5 degrees right to left) from 30 degrees to 45 degrees (this took about four  seconds), at the 45 degree position from horizon the object stopped and appeared to move away from us in the direction we were looking at it until the object completely vanished (approx. 8 sec. at the 45 degree position). Anyways we all went inside the house talking about what we had just saw, less than a minute later I decide to go back outside and take another look, and there in the same area just above the tree line, the same object appeared, my girlfriend, god daughter and I looked at the object through the binoculars and the object went throug! h the same maneuver as described above. I have gone back outsi! de to se arch for the object with no luck. I did call local police to report what I saw, and the said to call Pasco WA airport tower and make a report because the Walla Walla airport tower was not opened. Anyway, I am guessing that the object was approximately 15 to 20 miles away from the point where I saw it. The size of the object from where we saw it was about the size of a dime at 25 feet away. Well I just wanted to tell others what we all saw and attempt to describe the sighting to the best of my ability.  Regards,",2012-01-12T00:00:00,46.1107,-118.30770000000001

The two lights were either connected or one was following the first with a small space between which never grew or shrunk (parallel). It is also possible one light was ""chasing"" the first. The size was about five times that of the stars we can see in the sky but they were much lower than airplanes..  It was cloudy out because of rain, but these lights were below the clouds.

This incident occurred as I was taking out the garbage cans to the street edge at 10:45pm Sunday night. The weather had a slight fog, with a thin layer of clouds covering approximately 50% of the sky. I saw what I initially thought was an aircraft approach from the east at an altitude of approximately 1000-1500ft.  As this object approached closer to my position, I noticed it was giving off a brilliant orange color and had a spherical shape. It had no navigation or running lights (I am a former private pilot) It moved probably no faster than 60mph in my estimation. This object radiated the most brilliant and pure color of orange I have ever seen.  It flickered as it moved, as a road flare flickers when burning. The object emitted no noise whatsoever. It was quite obviously spherical, with no projections anywhere. It made a slow arching turn from its initial flight path right toward where I was standing, slowed and then stopped almost nearly directly above me (staying at ~1500ft altitude).  The object hovered for no more than a few seconds.  Suddenly, this object flew straight up punching a hole directly through the cloud layer (est. 2000 ft) above it.  It flew to an altitude to where it was a pinpoint in less than 2 seconds. Notes/Impressions:  - Aircraft flight patterns in my area are generally from the the South to North (To/from SeaTac airport)  - This ""object"" I witnessed came from the east (from over Tacoma proper) which is unusual in my area unless it is a military aircraft from McChord AFB  - There was a few aircraft flying in the area at the time of this incident.  I would say there is a good chance a pilot flying in the area saw this object.  - Other people in my area at the time must have seen it.  The glow was quite brilliant.  - I got the impression it ""knew"" I was looking at it.  - The color of orange this thing emitted was extremely ""pure"" like coherent light from a laser - ie. the pure red or green you see from a laser. Not like an aircraft navigation light.  - The faster it moved the more it seemed to ""flicker""  - I am aircraft/military buff and can recognize most civilian and military aircraft.  I have never seen an object like this one. It flew outside the performance envelope of any aircraft I have known about.",2012-01-12T00:00:00,47.2012,-122.5419

We were in the Lakeview neighborhood looking west.  We were commenting on how many airplanes were in the sky waiting to land at O’hare. I first noticed a dark shape moving low in the sky trending N/NW.  At first I thought the moon had given me a sunspot and my eyes were deceiving me.  I pointed at it and my brother couldn’t see it at first.  It then passed above a street lamp and he saw it as well.  In the light it appeared brownish.  It was closest to being rectangular, long and thin, but instead of the “wingspan” being in the horizontal direction it was longest from top to bottom.  It was very low, appearing to be perhaps ten feet above the 3 story apartments across the parking lot. It flew very steadily and without much change in elevation or speed for about 75 yards before we lost sight of it. There were no lights on it, so I at first thought it may be an owl.  It seemed too large to be an owl and did not ever flap its wings, not to mention it would be gliding in a straight line, completely on its side if it were a bird. From my perspective I would guess the object was between 5 and ten feet from top to bottom and maybe 1 to 2 feet in width.  We had no perception of its depth from our view point, but I got the impression it was thin like a wedge.  It was moving between 10 and 20 mph on a night with winds out of the SW at 2-11 mph. There is a street below, but there are far too many trees for something to be attached to a car on the street or for someone to fly a kite.  There is also an EL train that trends in the same direction as the object moved.  It is unlikely we would be able to see something attached to the top of a train from that distance and viewpoint, but we are close enough to be able to hear trains go by with ease.  There was no train going by.  If it were something attached to the train it would have to be 30 feet or so above the train to be able to see it from that spot. Neither of us are UFO watchers or enthusiasts of any sort.  I liked the movie Independence Day, but that is about as far as I go with UFO’s.  I would appreciate any suggestions on what we might have seen.  My brother thought maybe a large trash bag was blowing in the wind, but he and I agree that it was far to steady in its shape, trajectory and speed to likely be a trash bag.  It also seemed to be going faster than the wind would allow.  A trash bag would probably undulate, while this object seemed rigid.  Any ideas?",2012-03-13T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

It made no sound and was coming from the north, where Grey's Beach (Bass Hole) is located. We pulled over to watch it and, as it was disappearing from our view, a second identical object appeared from the same direction as the first had come.  It was definitely not a plane, but we don't know what it was.  If anyone knows what these orange glowing objects were, we'd like to see the answer in your column. ((initials deleted)), Yarmouthport   Dear F.P.:  We would, too. Let's hope a reader will come up with an explanation.",2011-08-21T00:00:00,,

He turned to me and told me to look at it to make sure he was really seeing what we both believe to be a UFO. It was traveling at a steady pace at about 70-80 miles per hour at about 1/4 to 1/2 mile up. It was very clearly a triangle shape and had very define points to it. We were both very baffled as to how something that shape could be flying in the night sky. The sky was free from and clouds and it was very clear out. As it passed by it blocked the view of the stars so we knew we were looking as a solid object. It was a very surreal feeling to be looking at this object. It kind of scared me a bit as well. Being a very logical person I was going through things it might be in my head as I was analyzing it as it flew over. There was nothing that I could logically say it resembled that I have ever ! seen and I have seen many tv programs in military aircrafts and prototypes and this looked nothing like anything I have ever seen in my life. I would say the size would be in proportion with a 747 jet. It had 3 very dim square light at each triangle point. The lights were a white glow similar to a florescent bulb and they were casting a glow in between each light showing the triangle shape. As it flew over we noticed that there was no sound what so ever and as it passed us we could see the back of it as it glided over us. It was perfectly flying it a straight line and parallel to the sky. It never pivoted of veered off course. After it passed by we got a very good view of the back of the craft. It was a flat dark surface about 15 to 20 ft high. We continued to watch it until it was out of sight. I have to say that was a very eerie feeling and I will never forget what I saw that night.",2011-08-21T00:00:00,33.83243273727648,-117.89132517193949

It was right about 11:30 pm when we saw a very large, unusually bright, orange looking fireball that seemed to suddenly rise above the two story house which sits behind us.  The weather was clear that night; it truly was a beautiful evening out. It was so large and bright that it looked like it was right above us but really it was so far away. It was easily 20, 000 plus feet high in the air. The reason I am sure of this, is our guests that evening are of military and have government backgrounds, and are quit knowledgeable in these areas.  They too sat in wonder and curiosity as we watched this thing traveling above and across us.  The fireball first appeared above our neighbor’s  house to the East of us traveling West, moving toward us,  at a somewhat constant speed not to fast; as it became to become directly passing above us; one of the guys pointed out it appeared to have what looked like a ring around it.. They certainly couldn’t offer any explanations of what we were seeing, none of us could. Something else we noticed, there was absolutely was no sound coming from this object! It is not a far distance from the house behind us to ours, but it was just a few minutes, as it passed across us and once it did the orange fireball began to cross over the top of our house it continued moving West but at the same time seemed to almost move straight upward as well, much, much higher moving what look to disappear into the stars.  I certainly will never forget what I saw; I admit every night I find myself looking over the top of our neighbor’s house at night wanting too, and wondering if I will see this again, what an extraordinary site!",2011-08-21T00:00:00,41.6233535483871,-88.21431225806451

The object was flying about the same height as the planes that fly over the beach with an advertisement behind them.  This object made no sound and had an orange light behind the craft.  There were no other lights or visible wings.  My husband saw it as a flat orange light on the back and I thought it was like a series of large orange lights forming an octagon.

I already reported this under another shape.   I saw two fireballs glide by and there was no pyrotechs around.   It happened at 10 and 10:30.  We have had several things happen overhead and I was concentrating on the structure in the sky it had nine lights on either side with the end lights shining at an angle then in the center three lights of the nine there were lights beside it and inside those three center lights was a single light with more of a blue color hue.   I was looking at that for a few hours it was overhead and I questioned whether it was a satellite.  But last winter we had a circle made in the snow in our backyard.  My husband woke up and looked out into the yard and I tried to take pictures and a video.  I just got some of it on film.   A few years ago I had a ball of energy move from my bathroom into my hallway and hovered there. It was energy moving inside itself like balls of light that stretched and moved into each other and hovered ther! e looking at me.  It was crazy because I thought to myself I am not going to follow you because I don't want to die.   I felt it knew what I was thinking.   A few years earlier I saw a cigar shaped UFO and was told it could have been an experimental rocket.  I don't think so because it was flying over a populated area and had no fins and changed direction.  A few years before that I saw a sphere with a military plane directly above it.  I know something is going on out there.,2011-08-21T00:00:00,42.1162,-71.3306

About 2204 hours I noticed a light appear about 45 degrees above the horizon to the south.  At first, I thought it was an iridium satellite, as it grew in intensity and size to a brilliant yellowish color.   About 1 to 2 seconds later, a second object appeared behind the first, following the exact path of the first.   The objects were separated by a space which was approximately the width of my thumb at arms' length.  The second object got increasingly brighter, surpassing the brilliance of the first by a small margin.  Unlike iridium satellites, these two objects remained at peak illumination for maybe 5 to 10 seconds before fading.   My impression is that the objects were self-illuminated and not reflecting the Sun.   Both objects seemed to veer slightly to the northwest as they passed overhead.  Both objects faded out one after the other and could not be seen anymore.

It began while I was sitting on the front porch at my house an hour after the sun began to go down, precisely 5:58 PM.  I even caught 2 pictures of it on my picture phone which made the object look much smaller than it actually appeared from my point of view. (will be posted on the bottom of this page). First, I saw a bright flash out of the corner of my eye. I thought to myself that it must have been a spotlight rotating in the sky which I see from time to time but it never came back around so I dismissed it and moved on.  Soon after, I saw 3 bright lights in the distance behind the wood line coming towards the front of my house moving at a considerably slow speed and very quiet.  While moving forward nonetheless. shortly afer spotting the oblect in the distance, it finally arrived at the top of the horizon and almost over my house.  At this time I immediately called my brother, informed him of the spotting not knowing where he was and then hung up the phone to proceed taking a video with the camera on my phone.  When I was done, in my haste, I hit the end button deleting the video.  Quickly, I started to take a picture before it was completely out of view. I acquired two photos; One showing an object with 3 bright lights in a triangular formation on the bottom surface of an object which was not fully visible due to the darkness of it over the night sky though I do beleive it was triangular aswell. The second, shows the same light formation, this time, with the 3 white lights dimmed and a red one in the center. For whatever reason it appeared this way in the photo, I don't know, but there was a red light in the center that I could see dimming in and out behind the camera, but luckily each picture portrays a good example of the different lights. After the event I walked inside of my house. 5, maybe 10 minutes go by and my brother whom I had called in the beginning has now called me back.  To my surprise, he tells me that he is on the highway about 7 miles away and could see that where it would seem our house is from where he was at, there was an object over top.  I rush back outside and there was the same exact view I had just witnessed 5 minutes before, same path, same speed, and i was in the same spot.  This confused me because now I didn't know if there was two objects, or if this one traveled back around.  It traveling around is hard to believe because of the incredibly slow speed at which it was moving.  Unless it sped up when I walked inside and it made the loop. Anyways, after the second go around of which my brother witnessed from several miles away aswell as me, that was the end besides the conversating between the family of what had just happened. The next day some programs on the television described a phenomenon world wide of sightings just like mine that still are considered unidentified.  I was excited and so was he :)  (Images are much smaller than they actually appeared.  Also I am sorry for the poor quality.  The order sequence of taking them was first, the one with 3 white lights, then as I was a little more towards the rear, I took the one that appeared red.)

The craft appeared to be almost! the color of the sky, similar to a dark-cloud coloration, possibly a light blue, gray or silver hue, but barely discernible from the color of the sky at the time.

Well, about a week ago I saw a noticeably different star than the others, so I watched it for about 20 minutes. It was very yellow, like a bland yellow, and would have random blue and red flashing lights as well. Normally I wouldn't think anything of it because I'd assume it was just a plane or something. But it wasn't really moving. I went outside again the next hour and it was still there, in the exact same spot. As well as the hour after that. It was very creepy and eerie. I had started to stare at the sky because of all the stars and the little dipper was twinkling. And I believe it was Orion on the left side. The yellow ""star"" was in the middle of the two. Tonight, I was outside for a couple of minutes to smoke a cigarette as I regularly do. I looked up at the sky, to gaze at the stars as usual. I saw the little dipper twinkling again, so I looked to the left to see if Orion was there again, and it was. So I stared in the space between them, awaiting what I might see. I watched an airplane go by, to the left side, and as I kept watching, there, out of nowhere, another yellow star. It was very different from last week though.  It was the brightest yellow, almost like a sun of its own kind. It was the brightest thing in the entire sky.  I couldn't take my eyes away from it, and as I was watching it, these beams/rays of light started coming out of it like roots sprouting from a tree! There were four or five of the beams, some even seemed a little zig zagged.  I was getting nervous so I kept turning away and going to the door, but then I would go and look again thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me, and they were still there.  Still growing a little.  I ran inside to get my younger brother, he's 18, to go look at it and tell me what he saw but he was asleep and his door was locked.

After driving my girlfriend home, and coming back home, I started to look up at the beautiful clear sky. The sky  here in Houston is never clear and you definitely never see so many stars as they were tonight. The beautiful  clear night sky and stars hypnotize my attention for a few seconds . That’s when I saw this/ these object (s). It seemed around 100 or so feet above the sky and it came the north heading south, it cruised over my head and in open space so I got a real great look at it! It seemed like two metallic or dark stealth looking orbs, its pretty crazy because the orbs did not give any light.  The way I saw them was from their shape and a sort of reflection that reflected of the surface of the objects. The objects seemed around 20 -30 feet in diameter and were 20  feet apart in a parallel horizontal way. I at first mistook the objects for a single plane who I thought did not have the lights on (I thought the orbs we! re giant light bulbs on the edge of the wing or something) but I notice the orbs were separated as starts could be seen trough the 20 foot gap between them. That’s when I was like woah, what could that be? I also did not hear any noise, complete silence , which kind of creeped me out. As the objects cruised away , I saw them rotate around each other in a circular pattern.  When I saw that I totally lost it and decided to look down.

The following event happened last evening as I was driving alone. It occurred while I was approaching a stop sign on my way to work, a bright ball of light went over my vehicle in the sky. The ball of light illuminated the entire night sky, it appeared to descend into the wooded area across the street from the stop sign. As the ball of light went over the tree line it appeared to flash without making a sound.  It then dissipated and transitioned back to natural darkness.  I proceeded to work and returned home and informed my husband. He was intrigued and I thought it was a weird occurrence.  I thought I would report it. My daughter joked it was the end of the world and my son was sure it was an alien with a wink and a nod.  Like I said before, I thought it was weird. My husband was curious but not all that moved by the event.  He joked that we should get the flashlights and go investigate the crash site. Needless to say, we were fast asleep shortly thereafter. Hopefully this sighting was a mere meteorite and not the beginning of the return of the ancient aliens. Thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.

I played in the fire for about a minute and looked up to peek at Jupiter again. I looked up to see an orange light moving at me from the East, approx. 10 -20 times the size of Jupiter, or a small pea at arms length.  It then shifted color to a pretty red, back to orange, then back to red.  I say “shifted”; it did not blink, just changed color in a relaxed manor, about every second.  Pretty cool. I was very excited at this point, I finally was witnessing some orange lights.  They seem to be quite prevalent in many reports, lately. The light kind of meandered slightly, did not seem as if it had a constant speed (about that of a single engine plane), or a consistent direction.  It was difficult to really focus on, a few times I found myself playing with my vision through my bi-focals, because it seemed like I should be able to focus a little better on it.  This light had no sound attributed to it, and appeared to be about as far from me as a single engine aircraft. I would put it’s altitude at about 2500 feet. The light slowly meandered to a more southerly direction. Now looking SE at the light, the pulsing color began to have some white for a couple of pulses, then back to O and R.

I was passing Canon Road in Carlsbad, San Diego County, California.  I saw 3 bright orange lights at 9:20 pm Satuday, October 1.  These lights were only about 200 feet high and just east or inland from the freeway.  Thousands of people had to have seen them.  They were not planes.  They were not flares.  The only possibility, besides UFO's, was Chinese Lanterns.  I have never seen Chinese Lanterns; but I don't think that's what they were; because these were low enough, if they were Chinese Lanterns, I should have seen the balloon part illuminated by the flames.  Plus, these lights seemed like they were larger than I would expect a Chinese Lantern to be.  The lights were about the same size as a police helicopter light at 200 feet; but again, the lights did not shine light down----they were just bright orange lights---very bright. I was driving with my window down.  I did not hear a helicopter sound.  I pass Camp Pendleton Marine Base all the time----if these lights were helicopters, the helicopters would have easily been heard.  In fact, they would have been loud.  I heard nothing.  And I did not have the radio on. These fiery lights were orange (and one may have had blue on top).  The lights were a different color than any police helicopter light.  The lights were low.  2 of the lights were almost above the freeway, and the third light was more inland; so I got a good look at the 2 lights.  Anyway, I saw the 2 lights for about 10 seconds---again, as I was driving.  These 2 lights were not connected; they moved independent of each other.  I have seen many hot air balloons in Del Mar area.  These lights were not hot air balloons. The wind was calm tonight.  2-5 mph.  I checked the weather channel as soon as I got home (about 10 pm)----winds were variable about 2 mph.  These lights were moving more than 5 mph (more like 30 mph) and heading north along the freeway ( I was driving south).  I did not look very much at the third light-----I focused on the 2 closest lights.  Again, These lights were low.  My guess is a couple hundred feet.  They were bright; but did not emit towards the ground.  The lights were not flares.  There were no sparks or smoke being emitted from the lights. I don't know what they were.  Carlsbad in about 15 miles north of the air show at Miramar----which did occur earlier this evening.  These were not helicopters or other air craft.  I see military jets every day. It will be interesting to see if others. There had to have been thousands of people driving on the 5 freeway at 9:20 pm Saturday night October 1.

We looked to the north of us and there was a very bright orange flickering ball of light in the sky with a slight halo.  It looked like it was burning and I first thought a plane was on fire and expected it to descend at any moment.  I judge the height to be between 1000 to 2000 feet. There was a sound similar to a plane moving across the sky.  But I saw no other planes while looking around. We live in a flight path to Seatac international airport and a few miles south of a regional airport so we are use to seeing and hearing planes.  This was very different.  This light was too low for the jetliners that fly much higher and too large for the smaller cessnas that fly out of the regional airport nearby. This was not typical of the different planes and their normal lights  It seemed to move a few degrees to the east but very slowly. The cloud cover was sparse and low but I thought perhaps the light of this was diffusing oddly through the thin patchy clouds.  The stars were viewable throught the clouds and the light was shining down rather than horizontally. T he plane like sound diminished and the light seemed to hover in place for about 30 seconds.  I kept watching to see if it was a plane flying.  Then it just went straight up and suddenly disappeared.  The best description I can give is that it looked like the firey engines of a rocket as it is ascending.,2011-10-10T00:00:00,46.8427,-122.8501

Time of sighting was just after 10:00 PM. We were up at my parents cabin on Black Dan lake for a fishing trip and my brother-in-law and I had gone outside to look at the stars.  My brother-in-law has never been up to the cabin and I wanted him to see how many stars you can see way up north.  As we were walking out to the road I mentioned to him that it is so dark up here you will have a hard time seeing the your hand in front of your face. When we stepped out into the complete darkness we looked straight up and he was amazed at the amount of stars in the clear night sky.  As we looked south we were both taken by surprise and seemed to be in a state of shock. What we were looking at was a bright reddish orange object moving slowly in our direction coming from the southwest moving to the northeast. The object looked like a rectangular cube and the intensity of the light was like a brit fire.  We were looking at this object at about a 30 degree angle in the beginning to about a 60 degree angle when it disappeared.  There w! as no wind and the temperature was around 60 -65 degrees and the sky was clear. As the object moved slowly closer to our position my brother-in-law started saying go get your camera, over and over.  I don’t know why I didn’t run and get it at the first but I was in a state of aw.  The object continued move in out direction and I did run in side to get my camera.  As I was running in to get my camera it felt like I was running up hill and that I would never get it in time to capture the object. I franticly opened the door and started rumbling to get my camera bag open.  I had that strange felling that I was going to never make it, or it was just out of reach like in a dream.  I was able to get my camera and charged back out into the pitch black night.  As I ran out, I had turned on my camera and captured a short video of the object as it flew a way and then just disappeared in the night sky. My brother-in-law asked me if I got it and I explained that I could see the object as I recorded but it was distorted at times and looked like you were looking out a window with rain drops on it.  This object must have been a thousand feet in the air and was seen by us for about 5 minutes before it disappeared completely.  We did not see any outline around the light object but if you had a ping-pong ball held in your fingers at arms length this object would not be blocked out by the size of the ping-pong ball  (This is when the object was closest to us). Once the object was gone we both new we had seen something that would be hard to explain to the others in the cabin.  I don’t know why I didn’t yell out for everyone to come outside but I think we were just hypnotized by the moment.  I have always wondered what it would be like to see a Unidentified Flying Object and now I have even more wonderment than before. The video was taken as the object flew away from us to the northeast. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30dLJMdLk6I",2011-08-21T00:00:00,,

I went through my paper and have corrected them all. Hello My name is ((name deleted)) and I observed for approximately 10 seconds, in great clarity, in extremely close proximity, a  very, very large chevron shaped unidentified flying object that flew completely from one horizon towards my position, virtually  directly over my head, to the opposite horizon until I could no longer see it, on August 3rd, 2011 in Key Largo Florida at  approximately 11pm at night. My Background:  I was born in May of 1964 and raised in the Metro Detroit area.  I graduated from Western Michigan University in 1990.  I left the  Metro Detroit area and moved to Kansas City in September of 1996, and then finally re-located to Cape Coral, Florida in  September of 2000 where I reside today.  My occupation was in the restaurant/hospitality industry for most of my life and left that  behind when I became self-employed in March of 2004 as a Realtor in SW Florida. As a young man growing up during the Apollo era, I have always had an interest in aviation, space flight, the planets, the moon  and the stars.  I became so interested in astronomy at a young age that my parents gave me a telescope for Christmas when I  was 9 years old.  I still have a 900mm telescope today, although it doesn't get used all that often anymore. At any rate, I have  observed the Moon and its mesmerizing  countless craters countless times.  I have visited Mars, Jupiter, Saturn with my telescope as well and their observable moons and gazed at the Horse Head Nebula, many stars and variety of other celestial objects. Needless to say, I enjoy starring out into space and contemplating all of the greatest questions that confound mankind.  I am  always amazed that I am not seeing a picture of the present stars, but rather looking at a picture of the past stars, and of course its endless beauty.  In addition, through the years I have read books on astronomy, aviation and expanded my knowledge through  college academic's in calculus, physics and astronomy. I am an aviation buff as previously mentioned, I have attended many aviation shows over the years and I can say that I am  probably more familiar with civilian and military aircraft than the average Joe on the street.  My son has been to 10 shows with me,  and he is now 12 years of age.  I have seen just about every type of current military aircraft that civilians are allowed to see, on the ground up close, as well as performing maneuvers for the crowd over the tarmac. To finish the context of my background that is important for you to understand regarding how and why I was privileged enough to  witness this event, I must tell you a story of my past. One evening about 16 or 17 years ago I was laying in the grass at a rest  area with my then wife, outside the city of Detroit, to avoid the city lights. We were there, late night picnicking to observe a  meteor shower that we had discovered was happening, from a radio news broadcast we had heard a couple of days earlier. We  watched many shooting stars that evening, and noticed a bunch of small moving stars. We realized those slow moving stars were  not stars at all, they were satellites. Unexpectedly, I had found a new hobby that night, starring at the sky, in one direction for  long periods of time, then finding and watching satellites cross the sky. I thought that was so cool, to see something so small, so  far away, flying at 17, 500 miles per hour! It just brought me a little closer to outer space!  So, over the years while camping or at the beach, on the darkest of nights when the stars were at their brightest, my son and I  have laid on the ground and looked for satellites together many times. This night, last Wednesday, August the 3rd 2011 was not  our first time satellite gazing. The Event:  My son Julian and I went to Key Largo, Florida on Tuesday August 2nd, 2011 for a two and a half day get-a-way, to celebrate the  end of his summer vacation. 7th grade was starting that follow Monday, so we had planned on doing some snorkeling and fishing. Basically just goofing around and relaxing really.  So, on Tuesday morning we left for the ((name deleted)) Inn located at 97xxx   Hwy, MM 97.8 Bayside, Key Largo, FL 33037  Phone: (305) ((deleted))FAX: (305) ((deleted)). We arrived in the early afternoon,  check into the hotel and met up with some old friends. Then we proceeded to have a fun evening talking, walking on the small  dock and beach at the hotel and eventually went out to dinner that evening. On Wednesday, August 3rd, 2011, we got up in the morning and went to the beach again. I ended up doing most of the real  snorkeling and attempted to do some spear fishing. ((name deleted)) spent most of that morning and afternoon tooling around the real  shallow waters close to the beach with just his goggles on.  Later in the afternoon I met a lady, a guest of the hotel, who was  drinking a beer in the hotel beach waters relaxing.  She talked about this and that, and went on and on, but the two things I  remembered from our short conversation was that she was from northern Florida, and the night before, Tuesday (when we were  out to dinner) she and her husband had been shark fishing off of the little dock at the hotel, and they had done pretty well  catching a few nice sized sharks.  Well, I knew at that moment that Julian and I would be doing some shark fishing that night. It  sounded fun, it was convenient and - well - I wanted to catch a shark too!   That night at about 10:15pm, Julian and I headed to the dock with 2 fishing rods fitted with metal leaders, a fishing tackle box, 4  cans of dog food for shark chum and a box of thawed squid for bait. When we arrived at the Dock there were other people their. The lady from northern part of Florida (she was already fishing) and her son, a new female guest of Latino origin, and another  child I believed to be her son. So in total, there were 3 adults and 3 children. It was a beautiful evening almost completely clear  with a sporadic cloud now and again, but virtually clear. The two ladies were chit chatting away about this and that, the 2 other  boys were playing behind me. I wasn't really paying close attention to any of them at this time, as ((name deleted)) and I were setting our  gear down and getting ready to fish. Julian and I prepared our fishing rods. I went ahead and opened the cans of dog food and  threw the food into the water to bring the sharks closer to the shore. I then baited both fishing rods, each with one full squid and I cast the baits out into the Gulf of Mexico.  At that point, I asked Julian if he wanted to look for satellites and he said sure. So, Julian  and I laid down on the dock to begin looking, starring into the heavans...  NOTE: The docks shape is square and approximately 40'  X 40' and its orientation is such that if you were sitting at the end of the dock, on the edge, with your feet in the water, looking  straight out, you would be facing just about dead NW.  This is where I had cast our fishing rods out into the water. So when we  laid down on our backs, our feet were facing dead NW, with our heads pointed just about due SE. Starring up at the zenith of the sky only after a few minutes, we spotted a tiny red dot, a satellite emitting this faint light, like a  faint star, but crossing the night sky.  As we watched it cross the sky, suddenly one of our fishing rods exploded with the fishing  line running out of the real at a very fast rate! We both jumped up to our feet, I pulled the rod out of it's holder and handed it to  my son.  The 2 other boys came running up to us to watch, and the 2 ladies were there already chit chatting away, now standing  next to us watching the fishing battle. Julian was wrestling with a fiend from the deep and he was loving it.  I had to take the rod  from him a few times to ensure the fish wouldn't wrap himself around a buoy and dock a couple of times, but ((name)) did most of  the work and pulled up to the dock a 4.5 foot Lemon shark. We tried to land the shark as the lady from northern Florida said she  wanted to keep it, but while I was trying to take the hook out of it's mouth and not get bitten at the same time, the shark shook  it's head and jumped off the hook. It fell into the gulf waters and swam off. I asked my son to grab another squid from the box, and I re-baited the fishing rod and cast the bait back out into the Gulf of Mexico. The shark having swam off and the excitement over for the moment, ((name deleted)) began to hangout with the 2 other boys on the dock  behind me playing and talking. The were walking around the dock, then off the dock to the beach and back again to the dock  etc. The ladies still standing 5 feet away from me off to my right, went back into their conversation chit chatting away... I laid  down on the dock, back into my satellite hunting position.  My feet again pointing about due NW and my head about due SE.  The  lady from northern Florida still fishing as well. I starred straight up into the sky looking for movement in the stars, looking for  another satellite to show my son. As the ladies were talking, the Latino lady mentioned something about God and the stars and heavan and then mentioned  something about the North Star, at that juncture I interjected in their conversation and I pointed out to them, how you could find  the North Star by looking at the two stars on the end of the cup of the Big Dipper.  I told them to find the Big Dipper, and then the  2 stars at the end of the cup and showed them how they pointed like an arrow to the North Star...  They didn't seem impressed,  So I laid back down on the dock looking straight up, looking and looking for another satellite to show Julian and his new friends... This went on for about 30 minutes with no luck spotting another satellite. I then caught movement out of the corner of my left eyes' peripheral vision.  Still lying flat on my back, I simply turned my head to  the left (looking just about due SW) and to my amazement I clearly saw a large, and I mean large, flat black object approaching  me, us, quickly.  If I had to judge the objects altitude at the moment I first saw it, it was about 15 degrees above the horizon (or  about a fist and a half at arms length).  The objects physical width was about a fists width across.  It was approaching fast, that's  why I noticed it. It blocked out the star light as it was moving.  Although I had been looking straight up all of this time, my eyes  were wide open and in-tune to the ambient light, so it was easy to see. I leaped to my feet (my entire body has goose bumps as I  am writing this - remembering) - I leaped to my feet, pointed directly at it and started yelling ""look, look, look, look, look, look,  look, at that!!! look, look, look, look, look, look, look, at that!!!"" I was yelling, keeping my finger pointed straight at the craft as it  approached, so that everybody who had not been looking up, could focus on it, could find what it was I was seeing approaching  us in the sky.  It was moving quickly, straight, straight towards us, heading to be almost perfectly above us.... I wasn't paying attention to  anyone else so I really don't know what everybody elses locations were around me... all I could do was stare as it approached  very quickly, and I am yelling to everyone, I see it has lights underneath it. Not a lot of lights, maybe 5 or 6, white lights not too  big, kind of small actually, not flashing, but on - constant and white, they kind of look like the stars, running along the center line  of what I see, as it approaches - clear as if it were in day light - to be a chevron craft, huge, as it passes above me - it's size, its  wing span (for lack of a better definition) was... if you held your hands up to the sky and spread them apart 3 feet apart.  The  wings are perfectly symmetrical, the width from the leading edge to the lee ward edge was a fists width, the ends were square or  45 degree angles, they were not rounded like a boomerang.  It looks like a perfect chevron, with lights running across the center  line of the craft equidistant from each other.  It's was huge - it's the size of a cruise ship in Key West. The real creepy part - it doesn't make a sound - I can't even hear wind  running over the body of it. I'm thinking ""it's not silent, it's more than silent - nothing - no sound - Just me yelling as it's passing  over head - almost as if it were suppressing the sound - as it passes above us I start say ""Do you see that?  What is it? Oh my God  what is that.....Do you see that!""  It's moving away - never slowing, never buffeting, no lights blinking - no sound - it's past me  moving away - NO EXHAUST... It has no exhaust, no sound... I'm yelling - ""look there"", pointing at it, never taking my eyes off of  it, as I hear the boys come running up. It's approaching a cloud to the NE... I'm yelling at the boys to look hard before it  disappears ""look, look...it's going above that cloud, look at the other side of the cloud maybe you will see it when it comes out the  other side...."" and it was gone. It never slowed - it never turned - it passed almost directly above us, just so it's right wing tip was at the sky's zenith above me  and it's left wing tip directly away from me to the NW. It was flying on a course following the island from the SW to the NE. After the experience, the Latino lady left quickly, I never saw her again a long with the boy that was with her. The other boy, the  northern Florida lady's son couldn't stop talking about it, what he saw, over and over again. I was dumb founded. I just shook my  head head and could not understand what I had just seen. The feeling reminds me of when I was told my older brother had died. I  didn't go into shock like frozen or start crying, I just was amazed, dazed. I ask everyone did you see that?... and everyone said  yes, but there answers washed over me - I went into shock by going about my business.... I checked the fishing lines, lit a  cigarette and laid down on the dock, looking at the sky. I ask Julian if he had seen it and he said he yes he had... I started thinking ""was it a B-2 bomber? Could a B-2 bomber be flying that low? Why would a B-2 bomber being flying that low?? I  know B-2's are REALLY quiet, but could one fly that low and be SILENT?? No, it wasn't a B-2, when it flew over head it was a  chevron shape, didn't have the ""bat"" look with the B-2's ""W"" shaped tail end. There were no red and green navigation lights, just  the white lights across the center line or the entire mid line of the chevron shape...my mind was spinning... I went to our hotel  room, made a rum and coke and went back out to the dock. 15 - 20 minutes had passed. I laid back down on the dock, looking at  the sky, by the fishing rods smoking a cigarette. I asked the northern Florida lady, ""did you see that thing?"" that's all I could say... I couldn't even have an intelligent conversation about it, I had to have been in shock now that I look back. I didn't even have the  sense to ask for the northern Florida ladies phone number. Why? I'm an intelligent person??  Around midnight Julian and I packed it up and went back to our hotel room and we went to sleep. The next morning we had to  drive back to Cape Coral. I had some work to do with a client on Friday, and I wanted to make sure Julian was all set for Monday  morning school. On the ride home I called and told one of my best friends and told him what happened and what I had seen. He  fully believed me, but after I hung up with him, I thought I best be careful who I talk to about this... Friday, I had to talk to someone and get some answers, so I called the Monroe Sheriffs department, and I told them the basic  story. I asked if anyone had reported seeing an unusual object in the sky around 11pm last Wednesday night flying up the  coastline of Key Largo. The lady officer I spoke with actually took the time to ask around and check if any reports had been filed (I  didn't expect to get that much consideration with the story I had just given her) and she said no, but perhaps I should call  Homestead Air Force Base and see if the were conducting some sort of operations. So I did. I called Homestead Air Force Base and kind of gave the gentleman on the phone the short version like ""I think I saw something  like a B-2 bomber flying low over Key Largo last Wednesday night..."" He said quite plainly and politely that Homestead did not  have any B-2's stationed there. I asked him ""would a B-2 be flying that low over the Island in any event?"" He said that he really  didn't know. So, I called the Key West Naval Air Station to see if they had tracked anything on radar that night. I ended up getting  a message machine in their ""public relations"" department. I left a message asking for someone to contact me, and that I had few  important questions to ask, but no one returned my call... So I told 3 more people over the coarse of the last 5 days. My cousin,  and 2 people at work. I then decided I need to call somebody who knows more about this stuff. I contacted MUFON, and their investigator is out of town. Ann Castle, emailed me and said she would try to be in touch with me  next Monday. That's when I got back on line and found THE NATIONAL UFO REPORTING CENTER. I recognized Mr. Davenport's  name from previous TV shows and articles I have read and decided to leave a message explaining what happened last week. and  there it is... One of the things I keep thinking about over and over was how the object moved and looked as if it were a computer enhanced  image, almost like it was an image projected onto the sky because it was so perfect. It was like watching a space ship in a movie  theater, moving perfectly soundless, never fluttering, never buffeting, moving quickly - steadily, straight, soundless, moving  almost god like. OR, I guess you could say it looked like a ship in space, how once they are moving in a direction, they continue in  that direction unless acted on by another force. That's kind of the way it make me feel every time I reveiw the film in my head. Seemed like nothing was pushing or pulling it, it was just momentum. Maybe that's why there wasn't any sound? Airplanes and  jets tend to dip a wing, make the air move, make some sort of sound... Every time I think of it, I get the goose bumps because  although it was completely absorbing, fantasinating and I feel privileged to have been in the right place at the right time - it was  still really very eerie... One conclusion I have come to: If I was not looking up, I would have never had known it was there. No sound what so ever. It  would have passed right over all of our heads as we looked out on the water and never had a clue. Amazing. I have watched  every aviation program, every UFO program, every Big Foot Program etc...that has ever been broadcast on TV since I was a child. I have always wanted to see a UFO. I have looked at the skies looking for a UFO's for years and years. I never thought I would  really see one. I cetainly never thought to be caught purely by surprize and have one fly so close to me, over head, and to be so  immense. I truely am privileged. It was the most awesome sight I have ever seen next to seeing my son being born!  In conclusion, all I can think is that I hope it's one of ours, because if it is - we have some bad-ass flying machines up there! If it  isn't one of ours, one can only speculate to the possibilities and implications... Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Bright green light over north Long Beach CA.,Long Beach,CA,2011-08-05T22:15:00,light,5-6 minutes,"Occurred : 8/5/2011 22:15  (Entered as : 08/05/11 22:15) Reported: 8/7/2011 11:44:50 PM 23:44 Posted: 8/21/2011 Location: Long Beach, CA Shape: Light Duration:5-6 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83004.html,"Bright green light over north Long Beach CA. On Friday August 5, 2011, at approximately 10:15pm, my girlfriend and I were walking to our car after having dinner at ((name deleted)) Restaurant in Long Beach (XXXXX) East 2nd Street, Long Beach, CA 90803-5308)  As we were walking across the parking lot I noticed a bright green light moving in the sky. I thought it was a skyrocket at first so I kept looking at it, waiting for it to explode.  I was facing northeast. My girlfriend was right behind me but was fumbling with her purse, looking either for her phone or for cigarettes.  I can't remember which. Fireworks are a common sight during the summer in Southern California, and I thought this was part of a fireworks show being put on by an amusement park or maybe even the Orange County Fair.  But there was no explosion.  The bright green light appeared to just hover over North Long Beach. I should note that we were a few blocks from a south facing beach and that we were walking in an eastward direction through the parking lot.  The lights we saw did not appear directly above us but rather appeared about five or maybe even ten miles northeast of our location. The distance itself is a bit of a guess.  It was a clear night but I didn't notice any type of landmark that would help to determine how close or how far the lights really were, though it's possible that they were near the Long Beach Airport, as it is in the general direction of where we saw the lights. My girlfriend hadn’t noticed it yet so I asked her, ""Hey, what is that?""   I pointed to the green light that I’d been observing and she thought it was a plane, but I pointed out to her that it couldn’t be a plane or helicopter because there were no blinking lights on this object.  It remained one solid color throughout the entire sighting, bright green. As we were watching this thing we could see that the normal air traffic one sees every night was still happening.  There were helicopters in the distance and we could see planes in the sky, probably making their way to Long Beach Airport or LAX. The other thing we noticed was that the green light was the brightest light in the sky at that time. We watched it move back and forth (east to west then back again) for a few minutes. It’s difficult to say how fast it was moving but I would say its speed seemed similar to that of a commercial airliner moving across the horizon. Approximately two minutes into the sighting we noticed a second bright green light appear below the first green light.  This light appeared to be west of the original light we’d spotted.  We didn’t notice any movement with the second light.  It appeared to just be hovering in the sky. The second light appeared in the sky for about thirty seconds and then vanished. After the second light had vanished we noticed a third light appear below the original bright green one.  This light was east of the green light and was red in color. This third light’s movement was similar to that of a helicopter.  I actually thought it was a helicopter at first but noticed that there were no blinking lights on that object either. The light was a solid red. No blinking or anything else that one would associate with a typical helicopter flying over a large city with an airport nearby. This red light moved faster than the first light we'd spotted.  Not freakishly fast but more like a helicopter than anything else.  It looked like it was moving toward the green light but then it stopped and appeared to just hover near where the green light was. At this point my girlfriend and I noticed that the bright green light we’d originally noticed looked like it was starting to fade.  It disappeared momentarily and then reappeared in the same spot we’d last seen it. As this was happening the red light began to fade and disappeared completely.  This left the green light as the only light we could see hovering in the sky. It remained in the sky for another twenty seconds (approx) until it too disappeared completely. Seconds after the lights vanished we noticed two helicopters flying (circling?) around the area where we had seen the three mystery lights. The entire sighting lasted about five or six minutes.",2011-08-21T00:00:00,33.79002328838174,-118.17310534232365

This object showed up, in-between the moon and Jupiter, while I was trying to get a pretty shot of a very big cloud ring the moon and a star (or planet).  I really believe that someone in authority aught to take a look at these pictures.   There are 5 of them taken in a span of 1 to 2 minuets, the object is moving away quite rapidly and has a strange red, round, fog or thin haze (or a aurora) around it and gets further away in each pic. I still have the pictures on my phone, if needed, (wish it would have been a regular camera) never the less I down loaded them on my pc and magnified them in photoshop 7 and you should really look into this, in the first picture it looks like the moon is reflecting off of it on one side and has a shadow on the opposite side, I don’t believe it’s a weather balloon and it’s definitely not just a satellite or airplane. I caught this by accident and couldn’t see it ! with the naked eye, but saw it on the view screen of the first picture, so I aimed in the camera in the same vicinity and caught it 4 more times as it moved away from the area of the moon and planet. When magnified with software it has all kinds of colors, in shot 4 it has moved far to the right and is totally green in color. I managed to find it in picture # 5 if I added some brightness and contrast and again it’s totally green with colors around the edges. Nothing I try gets the same effect out of the moon or planet so it’s not the lens or software causing it. To try and explain any further would make it sound like a farce. God as my witness (and I take that pretty serious) this is not a hoax or doctored pictures. The pictures I’ll send are untouched, I made copies and that’s the ones I used to enhance. If I need to I would send the entire phone to an authority to validate. I’m 52 fairly educated and watch the skys quite often but have never seen any thing like this. I do! n't know if it’s a UFO but I would sure like to have some one ! tell me what it is. Contact me back and I’ll gladly give my phone number if you want a better explanation about it after you take a look at the pics.",2012-01-24T00:00:00,,

The witness left his business in Columbia, Mo., around 7:15PM on Friday, January 6, and drove the same route he took each evening to his home just on the outskirts of Boonville, Mo.  He was driving south on Highway 87 having just passed Old Highway 87 when he noticed reds lights in the middle of the road just ahead not quite to Clarks Fork.   Thinking he was coming up to an accident he slowed down.  The witness pulled to the side of the road and stopped his car.  He grabbed a flashlight, turned it on and shone it toward the pick up truck.   It was then that he realized the red lights were actually hovering over the truck stopped in the middle of Hwy 87.  The UFO then moved up and headed east toward Columbia.  The pick up truck sped off.  The UFO turned around and came back to the witness.  He reached for a camera but everything happened too fast; the Unknown was coming directly at him.  It stopped over his car and he could see orange and reddish lights reflected on the hood.  It seemed to! be coming down. The window was open and he leaned out thinking it might be a helicopter.  There was no prop noise only a deep bass sound with the rhythm of a heart beat.  Luckily it moved off and left him.  He arrived at his home at about 8PM. The next day his face was red and he felt slightly sick to his stomach and very thirsty.  He continues to be upset by theincident. I examined the car about a week later and there seemed to be no damage or anything unusual from the incident.

As I was driving home in between the time of 5:30 and 5:50 p.m.  I had passed 93 South to merge back to Route 1 in Massachusetts.  When I started to get close to exit 11B, I saw a string of lights in the sky in the top left corner of my windshield. The lights where in a straight line and flashed.  I would say it looked like an old camera flash going off in the far distance.  The row of lights where about 10 individual lights that went went off at the same time.   At first I thought it was a plane and I continued driving getting closer to exit 11B.  Because of the time, traffic became congested and my car was going maybe 5 mph if at all.  As I looked up all of a sudden there was a huge craft of some some sort floating right across the highway from my left and crossed into the woods to my right.  What was strange about this object was that it wasn't hovering like a helicopter or pushing air to keep itself up.  The object was steady when floating across and it never wavered.  The object floated right across the street with no disturbance to any cars.  The object was moving so low and so slow that I was able to see what it looked like from its underside.   There were 3 white lights in the form of an Isosceles triangle, one blue orb in the middle which color looked like a car high beam blue, and a small red dot near the white light near the top.  Besides the lights, I could not see what the object was made out of.  It looked darker than black.  It looked like a moving shadow.  Light did not reflect on its surface.   The object was rather large in comparison to my sedan.  The object was as big as two sedans parked next to each other.  The object was no higher than the exit sign above me, which I estimate to be somewhere between 100 to 200 feet in the air.   I was in too much shock to take any video with my phone.   Once the object moved into the woods the object came to a halt then just started  to flash in the wooded area to my right.   As traffic started to move again, I continued to move forward while the object above ground continued to flash.

I thought I may just have been paranoia, but for the last month I've been seeing this 'star' just to the right of Orion's belt (usually) move in unpredictable and unexplainable ways.  To make sure it wasn't like anything else, I've been paying special attention to the way that airplanes and satellites have been moving. I'm a scientific person--and so the fact that this shape was darting in every direction across the sky all the while beaming a blueish/white light seemed extremely bizarre.  Alas, it never happened when I wanted it to, but just tonight while I was on my balcony it appeared.  Fortunately, I had my family over and I ushered them back to see it.  They all noticed the scene, and all were aghast and more or less creeped out. The disk was distant, but a faint outline could be seen. It emitted one strong light from its center and a seemingly smaller light just above that. The shape rotated ! around in the sky in bizarre motions, and, while it first appeared to the right of Orion's Belt, by the time I stopped watching it, it was to the left. While I'm sure this tale isn't as bizarre as many others reported here, I was curious to see if anyone else had seen this tonight.

It was dark, but the sky was still somewhat lit. We pulled over and parked in a church parking lot about a mile from our home, sat and watched. The aircraft continued to hover in the same area.  All of a sudden, the center white light went off, and two round larger lights came on.  The aircraft SLOWLY started coming towards us. At this point, I'd say it was a few hundred feet up.  Neither of us could see any ""height"" to this aircraft. It appeared flat. It was VERY quiet, not like the normal loud airplane passover sound you would hear. Again, it was very low, and very slow.  It was so quiet that you had to listen really close just to hear the engine. As it started coming closer I could see that the lights we! re on either end of each wing.  As it flew over us, I could just make out outline of the underside of it, and it was triangular shaped, sort of like under one of the fighter jet, but clearly had no front end, and no tail. It was clearly a triangular shaped aircraft. I honestly have no idea how big this thing was.  I just know that at the height it was flying, it was a fairly large aircraft.

My 12 yr old and I witnessed stationary lights in the sky again above Oswego, IL today. It was the same place and time of day as last November's sighting, 3:25pm in the western sky. The sun was getting lower in the sky and there were scattered clouds, though the sky was mostly sunny. The conditions were very similar to our sighting in November. One light appeared to the lower right (west) of the sun and the other was farther to the right (slightly northwest). We only saw them for a minute and then lost them and had to keep driving. When I got to our home, about a mile away, I got out our Sony Handycam and caught the lights on it. The stationary lights were in the clouds directly west, to the right of the setting sun, and the lights were lower and bigger than the airplanes that were present before and after. I focused in on one light 2 MINUTES INTO THE VIDEO and it appeared almost a triangular shape with fuzzy edges and it was a glowing reddish-pink on the top point, white in the center and green on the bottom two points. I was inside and there is dirt on the window. The video is shaky but if you pause on it you can really see the colors. I didn't know it at the time but I also caught three lights later in the video. These objects were stationary, not airplanes, as I was also watching and comparing them to airplanes with their contrails. There were no helicopters or small planes in the area when the lights appeared. As I was looking at the second video I caught what appears to be a dark disc skipping across the sky at minute 2:59.

One appeared much higher and further off than the other and was hardly moving. The closer plane appeared as a small alternating blinking green/red lights so I assume it was also far away, and it was moving at a slow pace and seemed to be moving in a North or Northwest direction. Suddenly, a small circular dot of very bright white light appeared, seemingly out of nowhere - it did not move in from any direction. It appeared slightly above and in between the two flying objects/helicopters I had been observing. It remained stationary for a fraction of a second, then quickly shot off at an amazing speed in the opposite direction of the lower flying object/helicopter and into a cloud. It seemed to be traveling in a South East direction. The cloud appeared to light up with a white light as the UFO went behind it. It traveled so fast that when it shot off, it only appeared as a stream of bright white light with just a hint of blue color to it. I commented to the person I was speaking on the phone with that I couldn't believe what I had just seen, and described it to them. I watched for several minutes waiting for the UFO to fly out of the cloud but never saw it exit the cloud. I feel it's worth noting that I saw this UFO in the same community where I live and there is also a Defense Mapping compound located there. (The compound does not have an airport or landing strip - it's not large enough, however I believe it does have a helicopter landing pad.) We frequently have low flying military planes and helicopters flying overhead in this area at all times of the day and night, which we've chocked up to the Defense Mapping compound very near our home. The military air traffic has picked up significantly in the last year and we're not sure why (they don't publicize that the air traffic is related to the Defense Mapping compound or anything else about the compound, which is private and guarded, but most in the community are aware of it and aware of the unusual air traffic in an otherwise very small suburban town). There's also hospital approximately 8-10 miles away that receives airlift patients. We are very used to seeing and are familiar with planes a! nd helicopters flying overhead, day and night, at varying distances, but I've never seen anything appear like this UFO did or move at a fraction of the incredible speed or behave the way this UFO did.

On Saturday July 30, 2011, I was out walking my dogs shortly before 9pm EDT.   It was a very pleasant evening with clear skies, calm winds, temperature in the low 70’s with a dewpoint in the lower 60’s.  Because I live in a very open area, adjacent to a large farm, it is always quite dark outside.  As such, when walking my dogs I always take a powerful spotlight with me…to light my way and also see if I am approaching any wildlife. I am an avid amateur astronomer, so whenever there are clear skies, I often take in the view while walking the dogs.  On this particular evening, I observed a very bright ""fireball"" looking object on the northern horizon.  The object was a brilliant red-orange color.  I would rate its apparent magnitude as -4 -- comparable to Venus at its brightest or the International Space Station.  The ""fireball: had a distinct circular shape to it.  Its apparent size was 4 times the size of Venus.   This object proceeded on a southerly course and flew directly over top of me.  It took approximately 45 seconds for the object to track from the Northern horizon to a position nearly overheard.  At the closest approach, I would approximate the altitude to be between 1500-2500 feet.  I was able to approximate altitude because I live a few miles from a small airport (Flying W; Medford, NJ).  Single engine craft on approach must adhere to a 600 ft flight level.  The fireball appeared to be 2-3  times higher.  This first object, after passing over me, vanished. Within 10 seconds of the first object vanishing, I noticed a second object, exact same characteristics; once again appear on the northern horizon.  At this point I asked my wife and daughter to come out and look at the object.  My wife brought her Nikon D5000 (DSLR 14MP) camera.  Once again, the object was a circular orb with an extremely bright red-orange light.  It followed the exact same course/heading as the first craft (North to South ... straight line).  Altitude was approximately 1,500 - 2,500 feet and speed was similar to that of the first object. This time, my wife was able to take two pictures of the object.  They are attached.  More importantly, I grabbed my spotlight (15 million candlepower) and began to shine it directly on the object at its closest approach to us (nearly overhead).  After 3 bursts of the spotlight, the bright red-orange light on the object immediately ceased.  I continued to shine the light on the object and was able to observe the following:  > The object appeared solid. The object had a round, circular shape. The object was clearly rotating or spinning in a counter-clockwise fashion. The object appeared to be 50-60% the size of the full moon. The object had a gray or silver color that reflected the spotlight beam. The object was completely devoid of any sound. The object continued on a southerly course, with no visible light, until we could no longer see it. The duration of the second sighting was no more than 3 minutes.   First appearance on Northern horizon to disappearing from view in the Southern sky. I am an avid amateur astronomer with many years of experience.  I also am very well versed in meteorology.  I know what commercial and military aircraft look like, as we are in the flight path of commercial (Philadelphia International) and military (McGuire AFB) airports.  I also know that the atmosphere was clear and stable at the time of the sighting.  I know what most objects are in the sky-- such as planets, stars, constellations, satellites etc.  I firmly believe that the object that was witnessed by my wife, daughter and me was not something that I have ever seen before.  It was certainly extraordinary.  I think I am most puzzled by the way the object immediately cut out its light when I focused a spotlight on it.  It certainly took my breath away to see the shape, color and rotation of the solid object as I illuminated it from below. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss this further.

Is this a satellite?   I can’t be sure but the two balls of light streaking across the sky came from that direction.   Plus does the satellite stay stationary?

On July 30th, at around ten p.m, my little brother had called me to tell me to grab my camera and come outside to film these 30 orange fireballs in the sky.  This is where I automatically believed what he was seeing because he is always very skeptical about UFO's.   As I grabbed my camera we got in his car and drove for a minute and immediately I had seen up to ten orange lights hovering in the distant sky.   They were located behind the WSM tower which has red lights blinking on it.  You could easily distinguish these fireballs from the tower lights or any airplanes.  They did not move and they were not stars (it was cloudy).   These looked like the same fireballs I had seen on July 4th that moved in formation from Nashville all the way south past Brentwood.  On the 4th, I had witnessed these lights with my parents and a few friends.  These made no noise and were not Chinese fire lanterns (they would have burned out the distance that these lights traveled).   Anyways, I tried to get video of the lights over Brentwood on the 30th, but my video camera is terrible at night and I was unable to capture anything.   I thought my brother, his friends, and myself were the only ones who saw the lights on the 30th, but I was wrong.  Yesterday a newspaper article mentioned something about the UFO's on the 30th, and today they say they may have pictures.  I have told people about what I saw and of course people shoot it down, but I have no reason to lie about it.   My brother, his friends, and myself are students who go to very credible universities.  Brentwood is a community full of lawyers and doctors.  If there are more witnesses besides myself and friends, it will be very credible.   I have seen different types of UFO's in my life and consider myself lucky to see such a thing.  I am writing this because there have been a string of sightings in this area over the past two months and I am just curious to see what everyone else has seen or heard.

Plus, there was no discernible noise coming from it that we could hear. My father, as a sceptic went to grab his binoculars to try and identify what it was.  When each of us looked through it, the lights seemed to be moving in a circular pattern.  I tried to explain this away saying that my hands were shaking, but both my parents said it was mving in a circle when they looked, too.   After about 15 minutes, my parents went inside and I went to leave for work. As I was pulling out of the driveway, though, I thought I saw 3 orange dots. I'm not sure, because when I looked back a second time, I didn't see them.  Four hours later, when I brought the truck back, I again saw the flashing light in the sky. On October 4, 2011 at approximately 03:45, I saw the light for a third time.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD))",2011-10-10T00:00:00,,

The object is about 317 degrees NW in the sky, according to my iPhone compass.   We continued to watch the object grow closer for about 2 more minutes when we realized that it wasn’t making any noise.  It also appeared to be glowing orange and had a circular shape.  It seemed like it was a glowing fireball.   But as it passed overhead at about 252 degrees W, we realized that it seemed to slow down and the glow started to dim.  As it began to disappear out of sight at 150 degree’s SE, the sphere was barely visible but was no longer glowing.   It took approximately 5 minutes to cross the sky all together.  t appeared to be flying a little higher that a normal commercial aircraft would fly.  We were located in a suburban area in Campbell, California, that is well lit so we did not see very many stars out but it began as a pretty clear night.  This was very bright! in the night sky.  As soon as it was almost out of view, we began hearing aircraft.  First was a large military, twin-engine craft, then a helicopter with a search light then military fighter jets.  Growing up near Moffitt Field, I know the sounds of the high-speed planes. Ten to fifteen minutes passed and a second bright orange ball headed towards us again.  It had the same bright glowing light, the same directionality and the same silence.  Unlike the first object, military planes were quickly following this one.  A larger twin-engine plane and this time 2 fighter jets.  Noticeably the planes were flying lower than the objects.   Unfortunately, the fog began rolling in from the west and obstructed our view of the rest of the events.    But before the object disappeared into the fog, we noticed that it had also begun to dim as the first one had. I’m not a technical person but I did record the images on my iPhone to view later.  As I was recording the images I noted that the object appeared to be the size of a dime in the night sky, where my iPhone video made it seem like a pin spot.

As I neared My home, I noticed what I thought to be a bright star or planet in the western sky.   As I was watching this very bright object, I thought I saw a small red dot appear then disappear a distance away.  Thinking that I must have surely imagined it but it was so weird looking I pulled over onto a gravel road, sitting on a hill, parked my vehicle, turned off the lights and just watched.  Object itself seemed to be red in the center with a white field floating around it.  Occasionally, the red point in the center would get very bright and appear to radiate and change the outer field to a red color momentarily.  The detached red light appeared a ways a way twice more in the time I was watching this occur. After a period of ten minutes or so, the red light in the center got very bright several times in rapid succession.  At this time, the halo like field around the red light seemed to consolidate with the center light.   What happened next was what really convinced me that what I saw had no natural or man-made explanation.  The now singular light split into a 3 small points of light, one red, one white, an another appeared to be a greenish, or blue.  Then all three lights in a perfect 60, 60 60 triangle all increase in intensity and went all red, an just disappeared.  There were no clouds near enough to this object for it to disappear behind, while it was very slowly moving southward during the time I observed this, I am sure it didn't move.  It was simply gone like someone flipped off a switch. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2011-08-21T00:00:00,44.1343,-92.528

They were in a triangular formation and appeared to be individual orbs.  My husband expressed that there had been 6 in the sky one minute ago, and ran back into the house to get his phone to try to take a picture.  I felt dizzy and grabbed the wall to steady myself.   When I looked back up to the orbs, one had gone. Now the two that were left were still in the same position as when I first saw them, then the one that was lower in the sky began to pulse, and I was afraid that it would go away before my husband could get a picture.  He waited for his phone to load and the lower orb flashed and in my opinion, shot out of site toward the South East.  The final orb that was a little higher and to the right of the one that just “left” was now beginning to pulse.  It moved down 2 inches in my view, and then shot off as well, toward the South East. We stood there in awe for a min, repeating, ”What was that?”, “What were those?”  I mentioned that maybe they were comets burning through the atmosphere, or perhaps something new that TAFB is testing in weaponry, but have NOT seen any news of this.  We searched the local newspaper and NASA’s web site to see if there were any comets that night, but found nothing.  We viewed some you tube videos labeled “Orange orbs” and some other people have captured this same phenomena in many other areas of our country and even in other countries. I read one opinion that they may be a plasma weapon of defense that is used to “melt” something from the sky.  This may be a laser that creates a photon ball of lightening in the sky and then can be maneuvered using micro-waves, a lot like the drones that are manipulated and used in the middle-east right now.

As the sound increased substantially, I then walked around to the front of my home. I looked up to the left first and saw a red light but at a quick glance I thought it was an airplane. At the same time two helicopters were approaching from over the mountains near Joshua Tree but coming from different directions. The helicopters, both, flew towards the red light. The red light then formed into mulitiple red lights and then became a solid object. As the helicopters got closer to this object, it ascended straight up vertically within a second. The helicopters stopped immediately. The object began to float and descend across the skies in a slow motion.

I opened the door to my house and yelled for everyone to come outside. I could still see it from my door, then I walked deeper into my backyard as I was still yelling. All of a sudden the red lights turned into a bright fluorescent, neon baby blue color. A couple seconds later it sped off south towards Palm Springs over the mountains by the windmills. It was so fast that the best way I can explain it is that it traveled at the speed of light. It literally disappeared in front of my eyes over the mountains. The helicopters proceeded to chase it in that direction. At it's largest, the object appeared the size of a football field and the helicopters looked like ants in comparison.

In between the hours of 20:30 and 21:50(unknown exactly) I stepped outside for a cigarette on my back porch. Naturally I gaze at the stars on my smoke breaks.  I turned my vision in the direction of S/SE for just a moment, and through the trees I noticed what appeared to be a shooting star. The event lasted at least 3 seconds.  Orion was almost directly above me to the south. I saw a small flash of light which appeared to be rounded in shape.  The size of it was at least ten times the size of a star visible from earth, or 1/10 the size of the moon as seen from earth.  It was going in a downward motion almost as if it were falling out of the sky. It was visible for ~3 seconds, white in color with some faint bluish tint on its edge with a brief faint tail of bright reddish color. I witnessed the full event in my peripheral vision and my first thought was 'shooting star'(which i have seen many of)  On my second thought, what I had seen had a flight path unlike a shooting star and a duration at least 3x that of a shooting star.  I spent the next ten minutes waiting to see it again and contemplating what it could have been.  It failed to appear again. My background or level of interest in anomalies such as this is purely a star gazing hobby with limited knowledge of constellations and cosmic activity.  My age range is 18-25, I am male.  Also I was not under the influence of any controlled substances or alcohol at the time.  My final assumption of the event was that it was a satellite falling from space (something I've not witnessed), but some part of me believes this to have been a UFO of some type. These statements are to the best of my memory and descriptive abilities.",2012-01-24T00:00:00,40.2503,-103.7999

While traveling in a car, approximately 1 mile north of the 401/55 intersection, traveling north on Rt 401, two white lights where spotted in the dark evening sky, to the east of a tower with red blinking lights in the vicinity of Ten-Ten road, but the craft was an unknown distance north of the tower.  Lights were originally believed to be that of a military transport on approach to Fort Bragg/Pope Army Airfield, until it was noticed that the craft did not have any blinking navigational aircraft lights.  Observer lost visual contact when traveling in the low spot south of 401/Ten-Ten Road intersection. While waiting for the traffic signal to change at the 401/Ten-Ten Road intersection, the two craft lights were noticed moving east toward the Clayton radio/TV towers, one behind the other, parallel to the ground.   The two white lights appeared to be moving as part of one object and maintained a uniform distance during travel.  Rate of movement was faster than a helicopter.  Object was traveling approximately 20-25 degrees above the horizon. Observer spotted craft a third time after passing Wake Tech campus on 401.  Craft appeared to be making a sweeping flat turn, full circle, back toward south Raleigh, approaching from the south.   Observer lost visual at approximately the intersection of 401/Ransdell Road. Observer spotted the craft a fourth time while traveling in the vicinity of Phillips Farm.  Craft appeared to be banking (left light was higher than the right light), lined up for flight over Garner/Raleigh moving at an accelerating speed to points north.  Observer lost visual due to trees at the top of the hill north of the Phillips Farm. By the time the observer made it to the intersection of 401/Old Stage Road the craft was no longer visible.  Observer was unable to determine if he was looking at one craft with two lights, or two crafts with one light each.  Brightness of the craft lights did not appear to change during the course of the observations and always appeared to point out from the craft, even when accelerating away to the north.  Lights were not observed pointing toward the ground.  No noise was heard.

I noticed a very bright light in the sky and studied it to see if it was a star or aircraft.   My husband brought out binoculars and we noticed that it was a triangle shaped object with 3 round lights that was changing in rotation.  There were 4-5 beams that came down from the object, and the beams changed with rotation.  Several times the object would appear to have a red or blueish green glow around it.  The object was hovering for the most part, but would make rapid movement and zip to the side.  Then hover for a few seconds in that spot, before zipping back to the other side.  It would also appear to lower down in elevation then rise back to higher elevation, mostly in a zig-zag pattern.  The object was directly to the west, which would place it either above the city of Seattle or out over the Puget Sound.  There was absolutely no sound associated with this object. I have never been a true believer ! or non-believer in UFO's.  My husband always thought the video footage of them on TV were hoaxes.  However, this morning he is stunned and now believes.

As I watched these groups of blinking lights I then noticed lights deploying from those area one at a time.  Once deployed from those areas, they then took flight and then looked like normal airplanes at night (white/red lights).  The 5 or 6 deployed ""planes"" scattered and seemed to 'scout' the Fenton and Arnold areas.  When I arrived home (Arnold, MO), we still saw the ""planes"" flying around.  Then one came flying over our house fairly low.  This is when I started to get a little scared.  The plane was low enough to see the formation of the red/white lights.  The craft had 3 white lights in a triangular formation  with a flashing red light in the center.  There was no tail light.  It sounded li! ke a prop plane but for as low as it was, it should have been much louder.  After it passed over I then noticed another craft (same with white/red lights) hovering further south and at a much higher altitude. . but it was not moving.  It remained stationary.  After seeing all this, I started to feel very uncomfortable, and then went inside pretending I saw nothing.

Airplane head lights? Helicopter?  Nope a rotating dodecahedron shaped object vibrating intense color in the sky over DeLand FL. I first noticed this star like object in the sky on my way back from going to the Bp Station at the corner of Kepler Road and 92 in DeLand, Florida. It actually caught my eye out of the corner while driving west on Kepler Rd on my way back to the house. It was bright enough to get my attention.  So I glanced over to my left and see this very bright star in the sky.  At this time I really didn't think about what it was other than ""star"".  It wasn't until I turned left onto Old Daytona Road and had the object now in front of me in full view did I realize it was way too bright to be just a star.  So I started running senarios through my head:  Maybe a plane coming in to the air port that was literally a quarter of a mile in front of me, or a helicopter possibly with a search light.  But as I got closer my intuition told me to have my husband meet me outside when I got to the house.  So I dialed the house phone and told him to come out front as I was pulling left o! nto Pierce Street making the object now on my right and directly in fron of my house. As I pull in the drive my Husband is stepping out the door of our home and starts to walk towards me. I turn around and point in the direction of the air port and point at the bright object. I asked ""What do you think that is?"" He looked at it for a minute and replied with a ""I don't know."" As we are looking on at this object for a few more seconds or so it dawns on me that my camera (a Nikcon Cool Pics P100) is in my purse in the car still.  So I go and get it.  This particular camera came with a 26x zoom one of the main reasons I picked it. I love to take pictures of the moon and this camera always comes out with the most beautiful marco and long distance moon shots I've seen from this style camera.  At the moment I had an eyelash or trash in my eye which made it hard for me to see so I handed my Husband the camera and told him to take some shots.  He began taking some pictures with my camera and wasn't really able to get a good focus on it.  So once I was free of the annoying fuzz in my eye I took over and managed to ge a few more shots in that were more focus.  When zoomed in to the max with my camera I noticed several things about the object one was it was solid and had an unusal shape to it one that most closely resembles a dodecahedron.  The other when I used my camera as a sort of binacular set I could watch the obejects movement which went in a fast clockwise, teeter totting motion. In this mode with my camera I could make out much detail of this object. It vibrated color, as it floated above the tree tops.  And moved too fast for my camera to capture the solid mass of the object and instead took almost see thur disc shaped photos of this otherwise bright light.  As it was pretty cold outside I went on into the house and gave my Husband the camera to do with as he pleased. It was a great experience.

At first, all four objects were what appeared to be a straight line.  As we drove a bit further and looked at the objects closer, we noticed that they were close and were not airplanes, so we pulled over behind another vehicle that was already pulled over looking at the objects. The objects had an orange color and made no noise.  The object at the far right started to fade as though it turned and was heading away in the opposite direction of where we were. Soon, it was gone from site. The remaining three objects slowly and silently, changed direction and converged into a triangle shape (if you connected the three objects).  The triangle shape they formed continued to converge getting smaller in size and then all three objects simultaneously faded and looked as though they turned and headed away from us. One other vehicle stopped along side of us to also view the strange lights. I tried to take a photo from my phone but all you can see is a very small dot.
