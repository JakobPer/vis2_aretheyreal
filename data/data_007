It was early in the morning (appx 1:00 am) and I was in my room (second floor) when I looked out the window and noticed bright lights. It appeared to be a low flying airplane and I thought nothing of it. A few minutes later I noticed the same thing and I went outside to my backyard.  A large, slow moving, black, triangular craft with lights was moving across the sky.  Ahead of it, was the object I had previously seen that I thought was a plane, it was the same triangle craft.  There was also a third triangle craft.  They were moving in single file from east to west.  I stood beneath them as they passed and I could hear a very faint hum, it was barely audible.  Other than that, they were silent.  I would estimate that they were 100-300 yards in width. This happened a couple of years ago, so I apoligize for the lack of description.  I submitted this because I saw a report on this website (NTL UFO Reporting Center) from Rochester that also dealt with triangular craft.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,43.1550415206858,-77.61785896384644

We were visiting at a ranch in Catlow Valley, OR approx. 45 north of the Nevada border.  I woke up and found that my fiance was sitting at the table in our travel trailer. I called out to him and he told me to come here, quickly.  When I got to where he was, I saw bright lights out by the road, coming towards the meadow.  They were approx. 1/4 mile away.  We watched as they hovered about 20' above the road and moved back and forth across the road.  This is desert area and the nearest house is about 4 miles to the north. This object was coming from the north east direction, moving somewhat south west.  When it reached the bottom of the meadow, it turned, raised in the air slightly and headed due west straight across the desert.  It was very bright and moving quickly.  In a matter of minutes, it covered at least 10 miles and then just disappeared.  The object appeared to be very large in size -- maybe 30' tall or more and about 20' across.  It was almost triangle shaped, with lights along the bottom, on the sides and on the top.  Where the object was spotted, there is nothing but sagebrush and there is no chance that it was any type of vehicle known to us.  There is no road out that way, no people, no houses, etc.  After the object was gone, my finace confessed to me that he saw something similar to that the previous year when he was at this same ranch helping with the haying, but he didn't tell me because he was the only one to see it and didn't think I would believe him. straight across the desert.  I watched until it was about a mile out in the desert and I could still see it clearly, then, all of a sudden, it tilted upward slightly and was gone.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,43.5979,-118.8958

Then I noticed that it was making strange and sharp turns and jumps side to side, I alerted my friend who then quickly picked up on the sight.  He saw the strange jigs and jumps it was making and the speed at which it was traveling.  We were both amazed because we had never seen anything like that before.  We have told a couple of people but most just say ""Oh.. that's nice.""",1999-01-28T00:00:00,42.28467811900192,-85.60508272552782

We had just finished looking at this home and were outside looking up at a lot of gnats just twenty feet in the air, when my brother-in-law said look! I said yeah I see the gnats, but he said no, farther up in the sky. Then I focused my eyes much farther up and saw a small silver sphere which hovered in one spot. As we (my wife, brother-in-law and myself) were watching, this small sphere suddenly at break-neck speed moved in a staight line towards the east of the valley.

I initially thought maybe it was a silver birthday balloon, but what I don't understand is why it stood directly overhead and didn't move, then all of a sudden moved at an extreme velocity in a straight line and was out of sight in about 3 seconds. We didn't report the sighting to authorities because we were still wondering about it. I did tell some of my co-workers friends and relatives about what we saw.

I called for my wife to get my binoculars. She did. By this time the three lights had formed a triangle east of me and were low on the horizon. I could not put all three lights in the field of view of the binoculars. I had to go from light to light.

I was looking towards the direction of where the car was parked when I noticed with my right field of view, a very large  dark object that was moving from East to West just above tree top. The event happened so fast that I could barely point fast enough with my hand (while yelling Look..Look!) towards the object, hoping to get my wife's attention. Even though black in color, it had dimly glowing light along all the bottom edges and the sihlouette of the object was easily distinguished as a large silent triangle. The scene was fairly quiet and I was able to clearly hear in the background the motor noise of a small plane, during and well after the event took place. I was so shook up with my heart pounding that I could hardly breathe. After the event took place I noticed that to attract my wife's attention to the black triangle I used my index finger with my arm fully extended.  This would later provide me with a scale of the relative size of the object.  The speed of movement across my field of view (in this case approximately 70° to 80°) took ~2 seconds. The altitude I estimated had to be less than some visible background mountain peaks that are ~3000ft about ~5 to 6 miles from wher I was viewing. It travelled right over the city and made no sound whatsoever!.  If I had not been gazing at exactly in the direction of the mountains behind the city, I would have missed the event.  It was that quick and that lucky.  After gaining my composure my wife and I exchanged information, but it was clearly evident that she had missed all the initial trajectory as i was trying to get her to follow the object by my pointing towards it.  The next morning I went back to the exact place I was standing the night before and took a picture.  From the picture I was able to determine the relative speed at >800 mph!...and an object size (when compared to some features of the background) observed the day I took the picture. I estimated the object to be some  60 to 80 meters? in some size (It's hard to extract all this from such a short mental picture). It also looked blunt at the back, not aerodynamic per se.  I noted that fromthe perspective that I saw it dissapear behing the trees, it looked more like a wide arrow head but was flat across the back. I purchased newspapers and asked around if any reports were submitted, but was not able to confirm any other observers which would have seen this craft.  I decided to document all my findings before submitting the information back in 1996, but regrettably I lost my report on a disk crash and later was not able to recover the file.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,34.317038103448276,-119.72054137931035

These covered sizable area of night sky. Smaller red lights came out of one end of lights then disappeared. Soon after I witnessed white, clustered, oscillating lights and a separate set of multi-colored lights that formed a line parallel to the horizon. This line sank out of view, but the white, oscillating lights continued to sparkle and dissipate once every 5-10 seconds for approximately 30 seconds.  I continued monitoring sky but saw nothing else.  There were numerous reports of strange lights in the sky that night, from Winfield to Wichita. At approximately 6:20 P.M. on October 30th, 1996 , I was driving east on 47th St. South out of Wichita Kansas.  When I got to about 2 miles west of Rose Hill Rd. I noticed 3 bright red lights, east-south-east, about 30 degrees up from the horizon.  They were lighting up, one at a time from right to left.  They formed a parallel line to the horizon and covered a sizable section of the night sky.  They lit up from right to left 5 to 6 times which took about 25 seconds.  I then noticed smaller, what appeared to be sparkling red lights just to the right of the furthest southern light.  They spread out and dissipated quickly.  The bright lights made one more sweep from right to left and then stopped.  I continued monitoring that section of sky as I headed east but the lights did not return. Ten minutes later I arrived home, 5 miles straight east of Rose Hill.  I got out of my car and then noticed very bright white lights straight east.  They appeared to be in a tight cluster and were oscillating.  As I watched they broke apart and dissipated.  I then noticed a multi-colored line of lights parallel to the horizon.  They were approxiamelty 10 degrees above the horizon and slowly sank.  They then disappeared.  About 2 seconds later I observed more bright white, clusterered lights that were above where the multi-colored line appeared at maybe 15 degrees above the horizon.  These disappeared only to light up again after about 5 seconds.  They appeared to sparkle for a few seconds and then die down.  After another 5-10 seconds the white lights returned for another few seconds and died down as they had done the first time.  I waited 15-20 seconds then ran into my house to find another witness.  When we returned, we monitored the sky for 10-15 minutes but saw no more lights.  We did, however. see approximately 5-10 airplane lights flying in the area that I had seen the lights.  I did not see these lights during the occurance. I called the Rose Hill police but they said they had no other reports of lights in the sky.  The local nightly news ran a story about strange lights being reported by residents of Winfield Kansas that night, so I called the Winfield police.  They said that there had been numerous reports of lights but that they had no explanation.

It got off the street and turned north and just stopped as if to let us look at it.  It just hovered over a populated neighborhood not doing anything.  It seemed to be about 50 ft. above the houses, very low.  It was huge.  We discussed wondering how such a thing could fly.  From the direction of the airport (east) we saw a very fast flying airplane coming our way.  The thing took off at a high rate of speed north and we gave chase along with the airplane.  We kept it in sight for another 6 miles and then lost it.  I called the airport to ask if anything had been reported and they said no.

I have been unable to find my previous entry listed and, being concerned that it somehow got lost, am transmitting a second.  This event occured October 30th, 1996.  I sighted the phenomenon alone ( I don't count my 2 year old son as a witness) but talked with 3 other people in the area who saw similar occurences.  The event was also broadcast on the local TV news and Wichita Eagle newspaper so you should be able to corroborate it.  According to the news, the majority of the sightings occured in Winfield Kansas which is about 20 miles south. At approximately 6:20 P.M. I was driving east on 47th street south, out of Wichita Kansas, about 3 miles west of Rose Hill road with my son.  I noticed three parallel bright red lights, east-south-east, about 30 degrees up from the horizon.  They covered a sizable portion of the night sky and if they were attached to the same craft, it would have been huge.

By the time we came back outside, the lights were gone and did not return.  I did however, see several airplane lights circling the area for atleast 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes I went back inside the house.  I called the Rose Hill police who said they had no other reports.  Shortly afterwards I heard about Winfield residents reporting strange lights on the nightly news. I called the Winfield police to report my sighting.  The dispatcher said that she had indeed received several similar reports that evening but did not take my report and did not seem concerned.  I attempted to call McConnell Air Force base, which is only 3-4 miles from my original sighting, but was unable to contact anyone. At the time of the sighting I was 35 years old.

I was in the kitchen of my house in The Woodlands, when an odd light in the sky caught my eye. The light was orange colored. I at first thought it might be a dim aircraft landing light. The location is within an approach area of Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH). However, the direction which the light followed was not consistent with approach or departure paths for IAH. I looked at the light through the window and trees, and it seemed to be moving a little erratically as seen through the branches of the pine and hardwoods in the back yard. I grabbed my binoculars and headed outside. Again, the color and intensity of the light was unusual. the binoculars were handy for watching birds at the feeder. I went to a clear area just behind my house, and observed the light with binoculars and naked (I wear glasses) eye. The object continued moving from the East to a point nearly overhead, before changing direction to the North. The night was clear, cool (dry), and moonlit. The time just before 10:00 pm. I did not hear any sound related to the object. I could not estimate the distance to the object. It was not nearby, but could have been any height above, say, 5,000 feet on up to the edge of the atmosphere. I cannot estamte the speed of the object, except to say that it moved from Zenith to Horizon in about 3-4 minutes. The visual size of the central (bright) part of the object was like observing Venus. The color of the object was a golden orange, similar to a dimmed incandescant lamp, and similar to the orange sodium vapor lamps now in commom use for public lighting. The central part was not flashing, but there were some variations in the brightness. Although ""bright"" I would not characterize the light as ""intense"". Around the center bright orange light, was a diffuse halo, or fog, of the same color as the central light, which would expand and contract, sometimes appearing to swirl around the central light. As the object was moving away from me, the intensity of the central light did not seem to diminish, as it would were it a lamp with reflector. There was no other light, nor shadow, nor detail observable with the object. It did seem difficult for me to keep a good focus on the object with either my eyes or the binoculars. The light approached from the East, till nearly overhead, then moved off toward the North, visible for perhaps five minutes before going behind trees to the north, and still visible through those trees until obscured by more dense growth and the northern horizon. This could give some indication of the altitude of the object; were it very high, it should become very small (due to distance) as it nearded the horizon, however, the size did not go very small. Consider a low-flying plane versus one crusing at 35,000 feet as it departs your area. This object appeared more like the low altitude craft as it reached my horizon, even though I could not estimate its height or distance while higher in the sky. The light moved slightly erattically in speed and direction. It did not make any dramatic changes in direction or speed, but did seem to wander around a bit. After I lost view of the object, I stood there contemplating what it was I maight have seen. I observed other aircraft approcahing and departing IAH. These craft were easily identifiable with the naked eye, red, green navigation lights, white beacons and landing lights, even lights on in the passenter cabin.  It was trivial to make out the outline (shadow) of the shape of overflying aircraft against the backdrop of stars and moonlit atmosphere. The orange object seen a minute before shared none of these traits. Every other questionable object I have ever seen in the sky finally resolved into something obviously of local origin... except this one. (end)",1999-01-28T00:00:00,,

On the night of 1/2/97, at approximately 19:15, my husband and I were viewing M42 (in Orion) from our balcony through our 10"" Mead LX200, with a 6.7-mm eyepiece.The night was clear, and we had never seen such depth of color in M42 before - it was beautiful.  I witness a small (star-sized) orange light travel roughly east to west(top to bottom of eyepiece) in about 3/4 of a second.  I immediately looked at that area with my naked eye, as did my husband, but we saw nothing.  Approximately 10 minutes later,my husband was viewing M42 with a 15-mm eyepiece.  He, too, witnesses a small ""yellow-orange"" light, traveling at the same apparent speed - although he describes its movement as ""erratic"".Again, our attempts at immediate naked-eye confirmation yield nothing.  We continue to observe M42 in the hopes that we will see another light.  This time, we alternate: oneviews through the scope while the other observes M42 with the naked eye - at this point, we have ruled out satellites (""erratic"" movement of the second light) and insects flying in front of our lens(none observed with naked eye - lights are in focus through scope - lights are visually quite small).  Approximately 10-15 minutes later (19:45), my husband is viewing through the scope,and I'm watching Orion like a hawk.  With my naked eye, I witness a white light, again visually star-sized, ""come out"" of the bottom star of Orion's sword, travel in a small curve or hook, and then travel at a visualangle of about 45 degrees.  It moves in a straight line until it is approximately under the right star of the belt, and it simply ""turns off"".  This takes about 2 seconds.The previous night, my brother and his friend were over observing M42 and Betelgeuse (19:00) and reported seeing ""shooting stars"" through the telescope.  My husband and I are amateurastronomers, and have seen meteors, satellites, airplanes - all of the ""reasonable"" explanations.  These three lights do not fit in with those explanations.

My reputation involves making reliable and sound informativedecisions, statements, and judgements.Obviously, I am somewhat skeptical.  I have tried to rationalize in mymind what I saw that night.

I looked up at the full moon behind the thickening layer of clouds.  It glowed beatifully in a halo of mist.  As I was admiring the view I suddenly noticed a strange point of light ""wandering"" around the sky at extremely high speed.  It crossed my field of view in under 2 seconds.  Because I could see a slight halo effect around the light I decided that it must be either inside or above the cloud layer.  This would mean that its altitude was above 20,000 feet. The light was extremely small yet intensely bright.  It was yellow or gold in color. The point had some dimensionality---it appeared to be a tiny sphere or oval---it definitely had some ball-like shape to it.  After zig-zaging around the sky, making sudden turns and traveling in wild arcs, it vanished.  The whole process took only about 2 seconds. I watched the sky for about 10 more minutes.  During that time I witnessed 4 more lights appear, zig-zag at extremely high speed, and then dissappear.  I could hardly believe my eyes.  I was so entranced, I didn't think to ask any passers by to look at it and confirm what I was seeing.  At one point two of the lights were in the sky at the same time, flying in very different erratic paths, almost as if they were dogfighting.  All the other lights appeared in sequence, only 1 at a time. In each case, they seemed to appear from about the same point in the sky and then follow roughly the same erratic flight path and then vanish at approximately the same area in the sky.  I could not tell if they were simply turning off or going behind thick clouds.  After about 10 minutes the activity stopped.  These lights were so small and fast that they were hard to catch even if one was looking up, so I wonder if anyone else saw them. A number of commercial jets were coming in or taking off from area runways during this event and they were quite clearly different in both appearance, sound, and behavior from the lights I witnessed.  For one thing, the lights were single points of light and seemed to be far above the clouds, and moved much much faster than any of the jets (or any jet I've ever seen for that matter).  The lights did not flash or change color, although there was a slight flicker to them as they moved. It almost appeared as if something was literally skipping along the upper atmosphere.  I considered the possibility that it might be some sort of debris burning up, but no debris can change direction or travel in series of loops, arcs and sudden right-angle turns, as these lights did.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

Westnedge a bright red flash illuminated the whole sky, the ground, everything in the truck, it was like a flash of bright lightning.  The flash was so bright it lit everything as bright as day in red. It originated from the forest to our right, my view of the actual object was blocked by the truck but my friend said he saw something like a beam of light shoot from the ground into the low clouds as it traveled up it seemed to split up into different parts and travel through the clouds.  There were some low clouds around the area that were kind of thick but the whole sky was not covered, there were many parts of the sky that were clear, no thunderstorms or anything.  Though this left us in awe we did not report it to the police.  I just saw the report address in the Battle Creek Enquirer (local newspaper,) so I decided to report it.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,42.28467811900192,-85.60508272552782

SIGHTING WAS MADE AT NIGHT, WITH NAKED EYE.  OBJECT FLEW THROUGH THE TREE TO TOP OF THE HOUSE, HOVERED, CIRCLED ONCE AND FLEW AWAY. I was outside on the patio with the dog, talking to a friend on the phone.  From the corner of my eye, I spotted movement through the branches of the tree beside the garage, about twenty feet from me.  I turned to get a closer look.  There were no outside lights on, nor was there any light from the house spilling onto the paito or garage as none were on at the time.  As I turned, the object floated through the tree limbs to the top of the house visible from the patio.  It hovered there for a few seconds, then circled somewhat drunkenly as if determinig the direction to go.  It then flew over the house towards my neighbors house in a southwesterly direction. I was unable to track it futher as it was gone in an instant.  I described it to my friend as I watched it.The object was about the size of a tennis ball, perfectly round.  It had an orangey-gold glow, reminding me of the light a firefly gives off, but more yellow.  It was to large to be an insect.  I normally wear glasses for distance viewing, but did not have them on at that time, so the object was large enough for me to see without my glasses.  It was perfectly round.I am 47 years old, female and married.  At the time, I was home alone as my husband was in the hospital.  I have seen some things in the past that I could not explain, but never bothered to tell anyone for fear I'd not be believed.  However, this was REALLY strange.  I have not been able to come up with any explaination.  The evening was clear, as I'd seen the comet earlier and there were stars out.  There are not lights anywhere near where I saw this objcet.I do have a question that is not related to this:  Are there planes that fly low, rather large with bright lights that DO NOT MAKE A NOISE?  I have seen several over the past five months.  As we live near a large airport, I wondered if what I've been seeing is a plane or planes?  It's usually late at night, after midnight when I see these.  They are not the planet Venus, unless the plantet likes to fly very low over our neighborhood.  I repeat, there is absolutely NO sound before or after this plane or whatever, flies overhead.  It's the bright lights that get your attention.I would prefer your not contacting me as it would upset my husband who is not in good health.

They were travelling down Lyman St. in Westboro.  They had passed a hospital on the left that leads into a large cornfield.  Mary looked over first and noticed the strange object.

I immediately thought it was odd and tracked it through the eye piece.  It must have been heading roughly due north since I only adjusted declination to track it. It appeared to be like an ""amoeba"" containing lights of red, blue and white.  It seemed there was distortion and the lights varied in position as if mildly bouncing yet constrained by individual points and still all part of the same object.  That described distortion was nothing like atmospheric and since I spotted the polar ice cap and terrain colors in a town near Houston, it seems odd.  I knew I was seeing something extraordinary and allowed my wife to look into the eye piece as I spun the declination knob at an appropriate speed.  Apparently I had only captured part of the object since she described the end section I had described plus a disc of lights numbering a dozen, half circle of red and half blue with two white lights!opposite each other outside of the circle.  Further, there were two fainter lights inside the circle and one outside towards the trailing section.  She reported sharper detail in some of the lights.  I moved back to view and had lost the object.  I scanned and found nothing.  We looked to the sky and saw nothing.  There was no noise.  We only got a few seconds each to look at it.  I’m sorry I let my wife look since I may have been able to track it longer and get a better look.  I spent the rest of the evening tracking airplanes and could not get the same results.  I later heard of sightings like this with terms like ""jellyfish"" and ""translucent"" which prompted me to report that I think I’ve seen the same thing.

I live in a penthouse where I have a wonderful view of the Santa Monica Mountains, the ocean and the city.  On a clear night, as this was, I can see very far.  I often sit out side to relax and look at my surroundings.  It is not uncommon to regularly see helicopters and planes from my view, especially with LAX so near.  This particular evening I saw what I thought to be a helicopter and it  really caught my attention.  I noticed that this helicopter was silent and usually they make quite a bit of noise.  I was looking at the object that I believed to be a helicopter and there was a direct light that it was shining  on the mountains, like a spotlight,  and moving low towards the ocean.  It was in a two to three mile distance of me, which is common for most of the helicopters in the area.  The light that I was watch!ing closely, without suspicion, disappeared, leaving puffs of smoke.  This was a trail of smoke that I had never seen a plane or a helicopter leave before.  The smoke was thick as if the object that it was coming from had been idled there for a long peroid of time and it had not been.  A few seconds later the object took off with enormous speed, heading north to the sky.  this is when I realized that the object could not be a helicopter at all.  Within seconds it was ""parked"" next to a star, very far away..  It probably reached its location next to the star in under five seconds. It was a clear path that it took and  it was as if it was trying to camaflauge itself  next to that star.  Then I saw a flashing red light that was actually  revolving.  From the distance where I was I could see the object and  I could tell that it was revolving with a red light..  A few seconds later it took off so fast that I could see it going north for about two seconds but it was going so fast th!at it just disappeared.  That is when I realized that I had seen a UFO.  I immediately called a friend and left a detailed message on her voice mail, as to not leave out any details and record it while it was fresh in my mind.  The next day I had to go out of town and did not know of your service until now.  I feel very relieved to have reported this and hope that someone may have seen something also.I have lived in California for a little over a year.  I moved to California from South Carolina for a job.  I am twenty four years old and am fairly concervative in my beliefs.  I was raised an ""Army Brat"", therefore traveling is nothing new to me.

It was in the northwestern sky above the mountains.  It changed direction after going up for about 5 minutes.  It then turned to a more northerly direction as it got smaller and higher.  As we looked at it, my son and I both saw what looked like a wide beam of light coming from this object shining down to earth.  We couldn't see it go all the way down because the light was partly behind the mountains at that time.As the object kept getting higher, we also noticed a smaller light below this object, approximately 3 inches below, if using your fingers to measure.  It was moving in a northeastly direction and moved very fast and again, using your fingers to measure, it moved approximately 5 inches in that direction and then it disappeared.

I then noticed that the lights which I had though were the wing tip lights, (which as you know blink red and green) were only white and that they were blinking in a circular pattern. There appeared to be a red light on the underside of the object which did not blink. The white lights were very bright and continued flashing the entire time that the object was visible to me. The object appeared to be cruising very slowly approximately 1 to 2 miles away.

At one point it elongated itself and moved one point to another almost instantaneously. At 00:25 am on May 10, 1997, I was getting into bed and glanced out my bedroom window and noticed a large white 'star' with a yellowish hue to it with a background of the black sky and other stars.   I remarked that I have never seen such a large 'star' before.  It didn't twinkle as the other stars did, which make me even more curious.  Its shape wasn't circular, but rather more a square with concaved side.  (Discription of star shape:  Place a square on one its corners, and its axises both vertical and horizontial, take the circumferencial straight lines and cause them to become concaved towards the center-point where the axises of square meet. )  This was the shape of the 'star'.After looking at the star for about ten seconds, it disappeard.  It reappeard several seconds later to the left of its original position.  The color had changed from the yellowish white to blueish white.  The size had also changed, it resembled more like a regular star size.  Intermittenly the blueish light would flash, although not at regular intervals.  Occasionally (two or three times), a small red light flashed (but not as frequently as the 'white' light) This red light was also irregular in its flashing.  No blue light was ever seen as in regular aircraft lights.The light moved from its '9 o'clock' position to the 'center of the clock' position' and immediately perform a 90 degree turn to the '12 o'clock' position. in a fraction of a second.  There was no gradient climb from the '9 o'clock' to the '12 o'clock' positions, even in the other movements mentioned below.It remained for several seconds in the '12' position, and performed a vertical descent to the '6 o'clock' position.  (No red light flashing)The light continued this movement between the above four points, but never, while I viewed it, move to the '3 o'clock' position.At one point in its movements, from the '9' to the 'center' positions, the object seemed to elongate itself and be at both positions at the same time for only a fraction of a second, and then repositioned itself  from the '9' to the 'center' positions.I decided to get my video camera, and after a quick search of two rooms, found it and returned to the bedroom, but unfortunaltely the light was gone, so I did not get it on video.Total time was about a 1 minute to a minute and a half.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,40.27123156626506,-111.62400433734939

They were round in shape and bright white with blue haze encircling them in color.  At first I only saw one, it was darting forward in an unimaginable rate of speed.After watching about 30 seconds the second object zoomed up behind the first and they were going the same speed for about 10 seconds.  Then the second object stopped still, while the first jetted around at different angles in front and behind the second.I then saw both objects start and stop several times.  Then the first one stopped then went straight up in an instant.  The second object then went forward until it disappeared.Im not sure what these two objects were, but I do know that there are no aircraft or weather ballons that I know of that could have moved at those angles and speeds.I dont want to sound like a kook, but I am curious if anyone else had witnessed this event.

One with flashing multi-colored lights, the second, somewhat bell-shaped with two white-yellow lights. They hovered above us and appeared to be observing us. On May 10, 1997 we were camping in a remote part of Los Padres National Forest. Our party consisted of myself, my wife ((Three names deleted)). Our location was a campsite known as Thorn Meadows, approximately 20 miles west of the small town of Lake of the Woods, in Ventura county. The elevation there is approximately 4000 ft., the winds were calm, the sky was clear, the stars were bright. A crescent moon was descending. We had camped at this site on two other occasions and although it is very remote, this was the first time we had not seen any other people in the area all day.At approximately 10:45 PM, we were finishing cleaning up after dinner. We had a fire burning. ((Name deleted)), pointing to the northeastern sky, said something to effect of, ""Hey, what is that thing? I’ve been watching it for a while and I can’t figure out what it is."" I looked in the direction he was pointing and I saw a flashing light, at approximately 50 degrees. At first I thought it was someone walking down the hill with a flashlight because of the erratic way it was flashing. I then realised that this could not be because there was no hill in that direction. After watching it for approx. 30 seconds, I realised two things: one, the flashing light it was emitting was rapidly changing color; two, it was moving in an unpredictable, erratic manner that could not possibly have been an airplane or helicopter. It was moving in a way that seemed to indicate it was searching for something. At that instant, I realised immediately it was not an ordinary aircraft. The object then changed dire!ction and came directly at us in a straight line moving at a high rate of speed which I could not quantify. The object then stopped in plain view, at roughly the same angle to the horizon. I found this very disturbing. Then ((Name deleted)) said, ""Look, there’s another one."" I turned my head and saw to the southeast, at approximately 30 degrees, another object that had, to me, appeared out of nowhere and was now hovering almost directly above us. This object was different from the other, it had two bright, white-yellow lights and seemed vaguely bell-shaped. Both objects were completely silent and up there you can hear a plane from miles away. I had the distinct but inexplicable sense that they were looking at us. I could not estimate the size or altitude of the objects, but the second object had a similar appearance to a helicopter hovering at maybe 1500 ft. In other words, it was clearly visible.I was quite frightened but ((Name deleted))was absolutely terror-stricken. She was completely resolute that we needed to leave immediately. Seeing the second object sitting up above us was all I needed to make up my mind to go. In seconds we gathered up the dogs, extinguished the fire and got in the truck and I drove as fast as I could down the dirt road. At one point, my wife saw the first object off to the right of our vehicle and believes it was following us. I did not see it and so cannot verify. Later I realised that we were in a classic abduction scenario and I’m glad we left, although I wonder if I would have had it not been for my wife’s urging. I also realise that if they really wanted us, we wouldn’t have had a chance. We spent the night in a motel room in town and went back early in the morning to gather up our things.Let me give you some background here for a frame of reference. I am a skeptical person by nature. In my youth I heard the stories of UFOs and thought, ""Well, that could be, but I’ll believe it when I see it."" Then, a number of years ago I read Communion which led to my reading a few other books on the subject. Then I realised what was really going on. However, I am most certainly not one of those people that goes around trying to spot UFOs, in fact the opposite is true. After reading Communion, I hoped to never see one of those things. I have spent a lot of time looking at the night sky and have never, until now, seen anything that was completely inexplicable. I am convinced that there is no way these objects that we witnessed could have been some experimental aircraft. The way they accelerated, stopped, changed direction, I don’t believe that a human would be able to withstand the g forces that would have been generated.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,,

We travelled to Porter which is off of HWY 59.  My 11 year old asked ""Mom, oh my God, what is that in the sky?""  I turned around at the Kroger right under the underpass.  She sounded frantic.  I looked and safely said""Probably parachutes.""  I drove back to 59 and proceeded to travel slowly on the feeder road going south towards Houston.  I was shocked and amazed at what I saw.  I looked around me and cars were pulling over on the sides of the road to see the objects.  There were about 15-20.  They looked like rocks or meteors floating suspended in the air.  I pulled over at a car dealership on the right and stared at them.  It was so unreal.  Like I was in a movie and it wasn't really happening.  One of the rocks looked very strange.  They were all at different altitudes and they were moving slowly towards the west/southwest.  I became aware of the fact that these objects could drop strait on our heads at any second,!so I backed out and left.  I turned around at the next exit.  By the time I got back to the spot and on the other side of the road heading north, the last of them could be seen just over the tree tops.  I headed up 1314 to Conroe.  I thought I could see them from the 242 loop, but no luck.  I don't know where they went or what in the world they were, but I would like to know if something like meteors can come into our atmosphere and float that way.  They appeared to be in 0 gravity.

My friend was driving, and I was in the passenger seat.  It was a very stary night, and the sky was completely clear.  We were coming upon an intersection where I saw a red, glowing object hovering over a corn field in back of a house across the street, in the left corner of the intersection.  I alerted my friend to its presense, where upon he accelerated in order to get a closer look.  As we neared the intersection the object began to move parallel to the road that we were traveling on.  I had my head out of the window.  The object seemed to be silent.  It maintaned a steady altitude of maybe 300-500 feet.  It then crossed the road in front of us, while gaining altitude, and then traveled off in what appeared to be a southwesterly direction. It was difficult for my friend and I do accurately estimate the distance between the object and the ground when we first observed it hovering.  It was oval or egg-shaped and glowed red. It seemed to emit an aura of sorts.  When I think back to this experience, due to the behavior of the object and the apparent absence human activity, I do feel as if we had surprised the object when we came upon it.  When it did cross in front of my friend's vehicle and continued to ascend into the atmosphere I believe that it did so to a certain point at which it stopped and once again hovered.  Because I followed its path with my eyes, I could see its ascension, but eventually the light ceased to move.  At this point I observed that the object did not appear to change in size, as it would if it were continually moving away from my point of observation.  In addition, the intensity of the red light it emitted did not change as it would if it had been moving away in a continuous manner.  At that time it appeared to me as a red light ""camoflouged"" amongst the spectrum of lights present in the sky.   Although we try to remain skeptical, my friend and I had never before experienced a ufo encounter of this nature.  We are both highly interested in the pursuit of the truth underlying this type of phenomena.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,41.935936363636365,-80.14508181818181

I don't think he has ever seen a picture of a flying triangle so I feel his report is completely truthful. He has seen saucer type crafts in photos, but not triangles. His description is as follows. It was a perfect triangle with lights on each side. The drawing showed 5 lights per side where the end light would be counted on both sides.  12 lights total.

We pulled into the parking lot of a local school and exited our vehicle to get a better observation.  What we saw appeared to be not one but a ""tight"" group of perhaps 10-15 extremely bright red lights in the shape of a flat triangle or ""delta"" at about 330 degrees (looking towards the Big Dipper constellation).  The objects semed perfectly motionless and emitted a constant bright reddish glow.  We observed no blinking of the lights, nor any other lights of another color (such as white aircraft lights).  After approximately 4-5 minutes of observing these objects, they appeared to suddenly dim and then suddenly disappeared from sight as if they lifted vertically at an extremely high rate of speed.  We heard no particular !sounds during this event.   We then returned home and shortly thereafter telephoned NUFORC to report the event as aforesaid.   We have not previously observed such an event as this and are very ""impressed"" at whatever our sighting was.

As a scientist with areasonable understanding of astronomy and meteorology, and with an equally good knowledgeof aircraft (both military and civilian), I can safely say that what my colleague and I witnessedwas something that I'm sure would not fall into most of the easily explainable categories. On aclear night during the Memorial Day weekend (24th of May), I saw something that lookedabsolutely enormous moving across the sky in a westerly direction. Since all I could see werethe lights to this thing (very bright white lights), I couldn't make out the shape precisely.What was even more puzzling was that the lights seemed to move, ever so slightly, withrespect to each other, but it was definitely not a ""formation"" of any kind of aircraft like I hadever seen. Although I couldn't guage the exact size of the object since I didn't know whataltitude it was at (although I would guess it was pretty high), it appeared to be bigger thananything I've ever seen flying before, maybe several times the size of a jumbo jet. There wasabsolutely no noise and it seemed to be moving very slowly. We were on a little stretch ofroad between Lake Tahoe and Interstate 80 and there were a lot of stars out, so I'd be reallysurprized if others in the Lake Tahoe area didn't spot these strange lights, also.

The object had the same appearance as it had had before they arrived at Pilot Rock, and it stayed with them (according to their conscious recollection, for another 30 minutes.

I was looking towards the SE. There was no sound. Several small airplanes also crossed over head that night, and those were quite loud. No light reflected on the low cloud cover, as did the many airplanes I saw that night, indicating it was very low in the sky. One could clearly see the airplanes white, red and blue flashing lights in distinct formation. What I saw actually became obscurred behind the trees in my yard at one point. It appeard to be only about 1 mile away, traveling over Bothell Way! The above description captures most of the information. I wish I had been more conscient of looking at relative surrounds to get a better idea of the objects size. I would say it was close to half the size of a lightbulb at 10 ft from the observer. I was very keen to observe the airplanes that night, to base my observations a the conditions and weather circumstances that night. It proved to me that it was definitely NOT an airplane, It was also not weather related. I do not believe it was an asteroid of some sort. There was no tail that I could see.I have lived in my house, where I observed this, for over 7 years. Occasionally airplanes on the horizon ""fool"" me into thinking they are not airplanes, when they come straight towards me, and their WHITE light seems unusually bright, and they dont appear to move. However, eventually they change course and I can see their distinctive colored lights and patters. In fact what I saw entered my vision from my left and crossed to my right. It never came straight at me. It's light was consistent in radiance.My background: I am a 32 year old female, and a graphic designer and artist. I will send you an illustration of what I saw. I may even be able to send you an actual animation, for that is also something I do for a living! I consider myself extremely open-minded to things of this nature, but to this point in my life I have never seen anything like what I saw June 6th!

This was NOT a meteorite.  I'm an amateur astonomer. Every meteorite I have ever seen was always white never any color, a small point of light, and faster and higher elevation than this object.  The color was a failrly brilliant (almost neon) light green, it had lesser shades of yellow and white.  It seemed like I could actually see a round object rather than the normal point of light.  It was geading toward earth at a 45% angle.  There is no way it could have burned-up as it was near ground level when it dissapeared to the NE behind Black Mountain.  It was the same size and light intensity when first viewed high up in the sky.  There was an alomost full moon at the time and the sky was still somewhat light from the sunset so it's even more amazing how bright and visible this object was, as the sky was far from dark at the time.By the way, I also witnessed the UFO's near Phoenix on 3-13-97 which I never reported until now.They were due south of here, I would estimate directly over Phoenix.  It's dark sky here as there is no city lights in this rural area 30-miles north of downtown Phoenix, but bright city lights in Phoenix may explain explain why my view was so good. Plus, I am elevated here at 2,600 foot level, on the slope of Black Mountain.  My wife and I observed the 3-13-97 objects for about 20 to 30-minutes.  They were in a quarter-circle formation with 5 objects to the right and 1 object to the left of center and seperated somewhat from the other five. They were much larger than a star or airplane lights.  The were round and glowing a steady white light.  They were heading very slowly from west to east, almost hovering in the sky and just barely moving.  They did not lose any altitude at all.  This eliminates them being flares or baloons like I heard the military said they may have been.  Plus they were flying in a well defined and steady geometrical formation. After about 15-minutes som!e of the objects simply starteddisappearing, almost light they turned their lights off.  After 10 to 30-minutes they all seemed to have disappeared from view.  It's not like they moved out of sight, butb they seemed to have simply ""blinked-off"".  There is no way they could be airplanes, far too slow and almost stationary.  They could not be flares as they lost no altitude at all during the entire time.  Plus, I believe they were close enough to make out the object, rather than just a point of light.  They were all equal size round white objects, except the on to the left of center was seperated from th others and may have been a little larger than the other five to the right of center.  All six were flying in a quarter circle formation and curved in a perfect geometrical arch.There is no other explanation for this than UFO's.

The formation was irregular, not like Air Force formation flying. We watched them fade from view to the East. There was no sound and the movement was very smooth. They were possibly around 800-1000 ft. high, (this is an approximation as the sky was totally clear).I do not know if the pulsating light and the squadron had anything to do with each other, but the cluster of crescent shapes was certainly hair raising. They were moving very fast. We only saw them for about 7-9 seconds. ((Name deleted))",1999-01-28T00:00:00,40.55069822812846,-105.07729501661129

It was approximately 10:09 p.m.  Suddenly all the dogs in the neighborhood started barking and my husband went outside to see what all the commotion was about.  He ran back in the house yelling for me to come and look.  I went out on our front porch and looked up into the sky to where my husband was pointing.  There was an object in the sky to the north, it was heading south.  At first I thought, so what, there's an airplane in the sky.  Then the object stopped and hovered in one place, it then slowly began to move back and forth, from north to south, then south to north, north to south, south to north, for about 8 or 9 minutes.  Suddenly the object shot straight up into sky then stopped and hovered. At this point I began to get the chills.  Suddenly three rays of white light shot out from this object in a downward direction.  The object continued to hover for another minute or so, then the !beams disappeared and the object began to move back and forth again (north, south, north, south).  The object then came directly toward us, heading south, and flew over us.  Until it was directly over us  there was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  When it was directly over us, you could hear an engine-type noise.  When it was directly over us, it appeared to be an airplane, but I have never seen an airplane move the way this object moved.  Nor have the dogs in my neighborhood ever barked at an airplane.  It was bizarre.  What the heck was it?  I don't know how far away it was.  I would say it definitely was not as far away as the stars or anything, guessing I would say maybe about 1500-2000 feet in the air.We live in a semi-rural desert area.  My husband and I are in our early 40's.  I have been a paralegal for 15 years, he trains horses.If you wish to contact me please use my Email address.  I would very much like to know what I saw.

We were alone at the road and when we stopped to verify it stopped too. It was not a helicopter 'cause there were no sound at all and it mooved almost 25 km. so it wasn't a light comming from the ground neither. We were 4 people comming from a practice session with our salsa band. We had to drive app. 30 km to get home and when we got out of the city the girl in the back saw ""something iin the sky"" so first we thought that there was a party going on somewhere. But as it was still there 5 minutes later we thought that it could bea car mooving with a light on lthe roof or something like that. But when we realized that it was a forest ti couldn't be that neither. Therefore, even I, who normally does not belive in such things, started to get nervous. We tried to stop the car to see if we could hear something but no sounds were there besides some birds. The sky was not cloudy but not totally free from clouds neither. There were som kindof fog. But it could not be a helicopter; if it were a helicopter I would have been able to see it above. An det light was not comming from the ground neither. We started the car again an drove app. 10 kmBut as it was ""following"" us we stopped the car once more. When we stopped the car it stopped too. It was always right beside us. When we passed through a small village we thought that we had lost it, but when we got through it rejoined us beside the road. We were driving from Fos sur Mer to Salon de Provence in South France. The singer who was sitting in the back (the girl who first saw the thing) claimed that she had seen exately the same ting in December last year with 2 friends as they were taking a walk in the forest. But it has only lasted for app. 10 seconds. This time the light followed the car for app. 25 km even when we took some sharp turns and when wh changed the road etc. it was right beside us.The Light:It was round but not like a circle. It was more like some small sqaures of light that was turning first one way and then the other in a smooth way. The center changed size all the time; it was like someting pulsing - like a heart. Around of the center there were the smaller squars of light og allwas turned in the same direction.It was like one of the best science fiction moovies ! It changed size, higth and speed. And it was sure that it followed us because wo drove app. 3 km through the city and made some very sharp turns. If it had been something from the ground id would have had to pass through a forest, a lake and one more forest. If it was comming from the sky it made no sound at all and it could see us even when we drove with the lights out. When we arrived at Salon de Provence it stopped following us and returned to where we came from.We were all affraid as it was clear that this could not be explained. Even the driver who is a non-believer was affraid.The persons in the car:  ((4 names deleted)).

I stopped my vehicle and tried to understand what it was. As I watched, it began to change shapes, and flash as if the entire unit was a strobe light. I am a former member of the Civil Air Patrol (1Lt.) and I am very familiar with small aircraft, and this was unlike anything I have ever seen. The craft seemed to be observing the construction of the communications tower. Traffic began to build behind me and I had to move to another location 20 seconds away, however, after I moved it was gone. No aircraft I have ever seen from this elevated view point can move out of the field of view so quickly. I live in Allison Park in Hampton Twp., about 12 miles North of the city of Pittsburgh PA. On Friday July 11 1997, I was on my way home at 3:25 PM. I entered the northern end of Topnic Dr.(in Hampton Twp) and from its high elevation I looked to see how much progress was made on the new communications tower being built near the township Municipal building and as I made the turn onto Topnic I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Looking due south, I saw the tower first. It was not far from being topped off. I could barely see the men working on the top section, but just off to the right, or to the west, there was a black object hovering, as if observing the tower. It was about 1500 above the ground and about 1/2 mile away from me and was so black it was if I was looking at a hole in the sky. It was sort of barrel shaped, and as I watched it hovering completly silent and motionless, it began to change shapes. It changed so many times that I could no longer tell what shape it wa! s. It then began to flash as if the entire craft was a strobe light, pulsing about every 2 seconds. I could see no detail in the craft, no lights or windows, just a black object in the sky hovering silently motionless at first, and then suddenly changing shapes, and flashing like a giant strobe light. I am a mature adult man, with years of experience in the USAF Civil Air Patrol. I live within the TCA of Pittsburgh International Airport, and I'm used to seeing aircraft of military, commercial, and private origin flying in the area. I have never in my life, however, seen anything that I can even say comes close to looking like the craft that I saw on 11 July 1997. My vehicle was stopped in the middle of the road as I observed this craft, and a few cars started to build up behind me. I moved on down the road where I lost sight of it for 20 seconds. When I got to another vantage point, it was gone. From the elevation that I was at, no aircraft, balloon, or helicopter could have moved out of my field of view so quickly. I never heard of any other witnesses, but would like to know, if anybody out there can tell me, if there were any other reports of this sighting. I didn't report this to anyone, because I didn't know who to report it to.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,40.5725,-79.9579

I was listening to the Art Bell show and had gone to the kitchen to get a glass of water. As I walk past the patio door I look out and saw a inverted triangle of soft golden white light. It was moving at about 60-70mph north along the flight path for Reno Cannon International Airport. At first I thought It was a planes landing lights, but I saw No blinking transponder! I stepped out side and the city was unusually quite. I listened and could hear no engine or jet noise! That is when I knew it was no plane! The flight path Is about 3 miles from my house and I can hear every plane that lands or takes off, and I have watched hundereds of planes take off and land in the 33 years I have lived here. I watched it move from just over the Reno Hilton Hotel, which is about 4-5 miles south west of my house, untill It was just over the dark line of my neighbors house due west off me when it just blinked off! At that distance I would estimate the size to be about 100 by 100 ft. The sides of the triangel were equal and the golden white light was soft enough that the glow did not distort the shape of the object. It was flying level at about a thousand ft. I own a dental laboratory and am use to paying attention to small details. It had travelled about 5 miles from the time I sppotted it untill it vanished about 90 sec. later. It travelled slow and level, it did not turn, pulsate or do any thing unusual except blink off with out even saying goodby. I thought that was very rude.

After closer observation we realized it had a definate shape, ability to change direction and altitude at will, and was indescribable in any common description. My wife and I were sitting in the hot tub on the roof of our 26 floor condominium building in downtown Salt Lake City.  From this location there is a complete view of the Salt Lake valley.  I had noticed a small fire burning several miles to the west of the city.   Shortly thereafter, as I was looking to the south from our location,  I noticed what appeared to be a small cloud of smoke floating from west to east and about 3 blocks to the south at the same level as our position.  Initially I assumed it to be from the fire I had noticed earlier, until I realize the wind direction was the opposite of the direction of travel of what I assumed was smoke and also the fire was too small and too distant for the smoke to remain together for that distance.  I immediately directed my wifes attention to what I was witnessing, and we watched in total amazement for several minutes as the object navigated within an approximate 2 mile area.  The only way to describe the object is through relating it to other known objects.  When we first started observing it, the object seemed to be just an undulating mass, but as we watched it, we realized that it did in fact have a shape that remained consistent throughout the entire episode.  This shape and movement would relate perfectly to movies we have seen of large stingrays as they move through the water with their outstretched fins waving, similar to birds wings in slow motion  The strangest part of the episode was that the object was almost entirely invisible, and the only recognition that it was even there was that it distorted everything behind it so that you could in fact make out the shape by observing these distortions.  Again, to relate it to something familiar, it resembled the creature in the movie ""The Predator"".  As we watched the object, it navigated in a very definate path, changing directions at will and traveling first from west to east, then to the south, then back to the west, then lowering in altitude close to a baseball stadium about a mile from our location,! then hovering at that spot for several minutes, then again rising in altitude and moving back to the west at a phenomonal speed until it totally disappeared.  This was all done with total disregard to wind speed or direction, which ruled out the cloud theory or the fact that it could be caused by a pocket of hot air which could have caused a mirage affect.  After it's disappearance, my wife and I remained stunned for several minutes just watching for it's return.  We then tryed to figure out what we had seen, since neither of us had said anything while we were watching it. Our descriptions to eachother afterwards confirmed that we had both seen the exact same phenomena and that it was nothing we had ever witnessed before or probably would ever again.  One of the things that we did realize was that it was our location that had made it possible to see it in the first place.  Had someone on the ground tryed to see it they  would not have been able to do so since it was only the distortions of the background objects that even made it possible to distinguish, and looking up against a blue sky would have made that impossible.  Whatever it was, I know it was not a heat distortion, or a cloud and that it was definately under some sort of guidance or control.  This event was very special to me since I have always been a believer in the possibility of many activities beyond our comprehension, but my wife has always thought that to be a rather ludicrous idea, until this event, which she still cannot explain or justify.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,40.704464857813726,-111.88213884685625

It was silver color, like when the sun shines on an airplane. It was traveling from east to west. What really caught my attention was that this capsuale shaped object was traveling east to west with this capsuale shape positioned verticle. I was walking to my vehicle where my friend was waiting, still watching as I walked to my vehicle. My friend and I proceeded to watch and have a discussion about this object, and the possibilities of what it might be when I got in my vehicle. Meanwhile it had traveled closer to the horizon. Suddenly there where two more of same objects that are eyes had now been drawn too. They were almost at the edege of the horizon. They were traveling even with each other side by side. They were also traveling east to west like the first one. Which was sitll traveling in same direction towards the other 2 in the western horizin. They were all traveling very fast .What we both saw next Immediately Eliminated alot of the possibilities of what we thought these objects might be. It was another capsuale shaped object dropping straight down into our atmosphere. The reason I can say this with confidence is that it was sparking, and it was red hot in color. It appeared to then just stop moveing momentarilly. It cooled quickly as I saw it change color from this red hot look to the silver color like the other three. Once it changed to this silver color it started moving east to west in same direction as the other 3 objects. Same speed very fast in a straight east to west direction.

Object was round and did not move. Driving West Bound on 164th St SW (6th Ave W cross street)in Martha Lake area of Lynnwood, WA and noticed a bright round object in the setting sun light.  It looked far off in the distance like out over the Pacific Ocean.  It looked large.  It seemed odd that it was large enough to block enough of the setting sun light to be visible and to aparently twinkle (emit its own light).  Intreagued I watched it intently.  It did not move relative to the horizon or the setting sun.  I then turned south on 13th Ave W past ELDEC (Crane) Electronics and lost sight of the object behind trees.  I then kept driving and eventually got to the Target store at Alderwood Mall (184th and Alderwood Mall Blvd in Lynnwood) and the object was still there and had not moved in the sky and still looked the same in terms of the light being emitted and the ability of the object to be seen through the brightness of the setting sun.  I got out of my truck and observed the object for approximately 2 minutes! and said wow it just isn't moving.  I went into the Target Store at 9:22 pm and the object was still there.

On the evening of August 10, 1997, I was outside at 11:30 pm watching for shooting stars when I saw what I thought was a satellite.  It was very dim, almost invisible, and I only noticed it because of the faint movement.  As I watched, the ""satellite"" suddenly flashed a brilliant yellow light.  The original light in the sky was barely a pinprick, but the flash was as large as my pinky nail held at arms length.  After the flash, the ""satellite"" seemed to disappear.  I could then make out faint movement and a tiny pinprick of light and then the object flashed again.  It moved in an east-to-west trajectory and flashed about every ten seconds until it went out of my line of sight.  I estimate that I watched the object for approximately 2, maybe 3 minutes.

Lights didn't seem ""twinkling"" or shooting-star like.  Didn't look like searchlights-too far up.  During the Perseid Meteor Showers.  Seemed like they didn't fit in up there! I went out that very early morning to specifically watch the star showers.  Living  in an apartment complex, there was a mostly dark area away from the lights where I laid out on the grass with my blanket around me; my head towards the south and my feet towards the north.  In this position on my back, it was dark enough to provide a spectacular view.  I had gone outside about 12:15-ish a.m. 8-12-97, so this is how I guess-timated the time of this event at about 12:30a.m.  Before the event happened, I watched the usual stuff, and the meteors were coming at about 2 or 3 a minute.  Then, suddenly an unusual configuration of four spots of light, with three on one side and one on the other side, (like it was pointing) start in the east (it just appeared out of nowhere) and moved somewhat smoothly and quickly to the west; straight across without fading!  It (the configuration) didn't look like it belonged up there; it seemed so out of place!  1.)  They certainly didn't look like a! group of searchlights.  They were too high up.  2.)  They didn't have the appearance of ""twinkling"" or comet-like (no tails).  3.)  The light spots were white and slightly blurred on the edges, but anyone watching wouldn't be able to miss what I saw.  These spots were in a definite arrangement or pattern, and I didn't see nor hear any plane or other recognizable shape that would tell me otherwise what this thing was.  It was an event of some sort that made me sit up, take notice and start thinking, as never in my life did I ever see anything like I saw that night.  I had actually sat up to say aloud to myself, ""What in the world was that?""  The configuration was definitely moving (purposefully so) east to west.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,,

The observers first noticed two aircraft, which appeared to be flying a parallel course directly south, in tandem formation, at the same altitude, and separated by only 1/2 to 1 mile.  The apparent close proximity of the two aircraft is what first drew the observers' attention and caused them to conclude that they were military aircraft, as opposed to commercial or private aircraft.  The individual who called and who submitted the written report stated that he and the other observers are familiar with the general flight characteristics of aircraft flying out of Roanoke, VA, airport, and they invariably maintain greater separation than what they observed for these two aircraft that had drawn their attention.

Within seconds of sighting the fourth aircraft, the observers realized that none of the conventional aircraft were able to keep up with the triangular craft, all of them beginning to fall behind at the latter apparently began to accelerate.

As they crossed the sky, one would speed ahead, then fall behind as another sped ahead, and at intervals one would cross over another in almost a playful manner. The impression I received at first was that of a three-cornered object tumbling, but when the lights passed in front of stars it was clear they were distinct from one another and not part of a larger solid object, as the stars were clearly visible between the lights. The lights were about the brighness of the dimmest of the stars visible, and a warm yellow color. This same night we had observed several meteors and several commercial aircraft.

I first spotted these bright, white round or oblong objects (they resembled a bright star)at 9:30 am on Sunday August, 17, 1997  in the morning. I noticed one such oject  flying from west to east  above and behind a blimp which was traveling slowly in the opposite direction. I viewed this through a a glass door overlooking downtown Philadelphia, PA from my fifth floor apartment building. The sky was clear blue. I opened the door onto an outside porch to view the flying bright object unobstructed. There were two other objects on the right flying east. They were not flying terribly fast, but they appeared to be flying in a triangular formation. I sighted such objects from 9:30 am until 4 pm. They would continue for the most part to appear from the north and fly east. There would be anywhere from one object to eight objects in the sky at once, moving in and out of various flight patterns (triangular, stacked, linear). They usually flew in three's in a triangular formation. Somethimes two would fly very close together, and then move apart. Sometimes two would fly as a double on top of one another or next to one another. At 1:30 pm I saw as many an eight objects in the sky at once. I was walking to the market a few blocks from my apartment building. When I reached the store I could see above the store  moving from north to east approx. seven or eight bright round objects. They resembled a bright star, like venus. There was, however, at this time one object that appreared brighter than the rest and its upper portion flashed or blinked. Next to it appeared an object that was smaller and appeared a dull red. That object moved east and disappeared. Three of the other objects moved north and four others moved east. By the time I returned home, I could see two objects stacked on top of one another flying east. These objects were small. It is hard to guess at what altitude they were flying. I would say at least 30,000 feet. Objects would appear out of the north and fly east until about 4:00 pm. At least one or two was always present in the sky. Then they tapered off and by 4-4:30 pm, there were no objects sighted.  My roommate saw the objects as well and was baffled. It was very strange since it lasted such a long period of time. I called one of the local news stations around 2 pm, but nothing was reported on the evening news. The objects were not very large, the size of a star, like venus. They were very bright, white in color. They moved with a strange fluidity. That is what caught my attention initially. They would move together and apart quite rapidly and in and out of various formations.There is an airport that is nearby and many planes could be seen while the objects were visible. But the objects and a plane cou! ld not be confused because of the objects movement. They moved with an agility that I have never seen a plan demonstrate. I am a native of the Philadelphia area for the past 30 years and am very used to seeing planes. These objects were different. They were not random lights because they seemed to moved in very purposeful, logical  formations and repeated these patterns often. Their speed was much  faster than your average commercial plane, but they did not streak across the sky or anything like that.  Sometimes the formations(triangles, lines, stacked) spanned many miles, sometimes they were closed in. Usually they would expand and contract the formation or move out of the formation into another one. There is an Air Force Base in New Jersey, McGuire Air Force Base, perhaps 50 miles away. But these objects did not resemble any miliary aircraft that I every saw.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,39.99063505273804,-75.14580121369744

A small ball a (1 to 3 feet) was at the end of the pole. I believe the small wing was used to rapidly change the direction of the craft when it ""skidded"" in the air.

I looked where he was pointing.  The object was zipping into this valley about 5 miles away to our wnw.  We were located about 10 miles nw of Roseburg OR., USA. The object would be real dim, then brighten intensly, brighter than Venus, but pulsing also, sometimes every color of the rainbow, it seemed.  At one point, the light went down out of sight, then a pause, then it came shooting up out of the valley like a squiggly glowing red sperm, then disappear. Then it would reappear from somewhere else, moving a different direction. Keep in mind, a pretty violent thunderstorm is blasting lightning down, rather close to us at times.  This object was below the cloud deck. At one point it appeared to come very close to us, I swear, I could makeout some sort of lighted window panes, with a darker one in between. I assumed the object was close at that point, possibly within a few hundred yards.  In any case it must have been rather small, perhaps less than 15 meters in size. Well, this went on for about 1.5 hours and we simply weren't watching the lightning anymore, we didn't even care that it was getting within 10 miles of us. Ok your thinking, ball lightning right. No.  I would have settled for that, but then something remarkable happened. my friend was looking around for the onject to reappear somewhere else, like it was doing, then I saw it, a perfect white cone of light beaming accross the bottom of the thunderclouds.  There was very little thunder, and no rain at our location, and we could hear no aircraft of any kind. This ""spotlight"" came from the object, which had reappeared again. I yelled to my friend, but it disappeared just then.  It happened again, and we both saw it. This time, the object was near us and it beamed that perfect white light right above our heads about 100 feet and ""scanned"" the hillside right behind us.

I was coming down the mountain and was about 6 miles north of Alta Loma California when I and my partner observed the bright circular object appearing to maintain both it's altitude and position. We pulled over to the side of the road and I inspected the object with 10X50 binoculars, but could dicern no further detail because of the extremely bright ""reflection."" We initially thought the object was a weather or scientific balloon and that it was reflecting the sun - over the horizon. Given the approximate 2000 asl of the hills I estimate the object to have been about 3500 to 4000 feet above sea level. As we watched the object we were perplexed to see how the object could have been reflecting the sun which had already set. Additionally, we were viewing an object which was south-west of our position. Which should have minimized if not eliminated the potential reflection. After deciding it ""couldn't be a UFO"" we proceeded down the road and lost view of the object. I am very familiar with the area as both a resident and private pilot, having flown throughout the local area from Brackett airport in Pomona. Such an object would be a hazard to airmen in the area, especially at that time of night. I returned on the following day at about 1900 and observed the object again. This time I only watched it moving for about 20 minutes, then proceeded along the mountain road in an effort to gain a closer vantage point. Once I moved to a point that should have been directly east of it, I was no longer able to see the object. I returned to the prior vantage point (north-east where I lost visual contact) and could not relocate the object. There was a period of about 20 minutes from the point that I moved south-west to get closer to the object and when I returned to the initial vantage point. I am a former California licensed private investigator with over 15 years of surveillance experience as well as a former Marine Corps Intelligence Analyst assigned to the Air Wing. I am very familiar with most objects/craft including fixed/helo military and civilian and I could not identify what this object was.

In the wee hours of the morning of October 15th, 1997 at about 2:15 A.M. I was sleeping in my bed when I suddenly woke from my sleep from a strange presence in my room. I was positioned in such a way, that I could see my clock. The time read 2:15 A.M. 	I was laying on my back and for some reason, an odd feeling swept through my body. This ( feeling ), forced me to close my eyelids. The next thing I knew, was that I was laying on my stomach, looking up at the clock which now read 5:15 A.M. The strange presence was still in the room with me and once again I was forced to close my eyelids. At this time, I was asleep, only to be awakened by my alarm clock at 6:15 A.M. 	When I first woke up, I did not even remember the odd events of the night before. However, the images soon came. As I woke up, I started to remember some of the events. The strange presence at 2:15 A.M. , and something else. The image was so vivid, it could have not been a dream. 	Just after I had been forced to close my eyes, I could remember standing naked in an oval shaped room. The walls were metal, with small windows in the top right hand corner. ( They looked like the ones in grocery stores. The place were they can watch every alley from above with the two way mirror glass. ) Directly behind me was a large door where the two oval walls meet. In the middle of the room, was an odd looking operating table with two needle devices on robotic arms sticking out of the side. This was the only object in the room. 	I turned in fear and started banging on the large door, demanding that I be let out. I could hear voices in the background of my head, yet there was no noise except for a low humm in the walls. I was then told by an angry male voice in my head to either lay down on the table and do as I was told or someone I loved would be hurt. Fearing this would actually happen, I did as I was told. I was asked to lay in such a manner that my left hand lower back was exposed to the two needle like objects. One of the objects had a clear window on it and I could see the contents. what ever was inside of it was clear.  At the base of the needle was a triangle shaped piece of metal and two rectangle designs on both sides of the objects. I was told by a more friendly female voice that I would feel no pain but I would feel my legs go numb and would feel that I could not move even though I could if I wished. 	As I laid there, the robotic arm moved closer to my back and suddenly plunged into my lower left hand side of my back. I could feel the clear liquid being pushed into my body. Then suddenly, I felt numb and paralyzed. I tried to move my arm and I discovered that I could still move. By this time, the needle had been inside of me for over a minute. Then the needle started to suck instead of inject. Then it moved out and away from my back. At this time, the second needle moved toward the same spot on my back and plunged in. 	It was at this time I work up laying on my stomach looking up at the clock that read 5:15 A.M. As I brushed my teeth that morning, I noticed that I had a small pain in my back near my kidneys. I lifted my shirt to discover physical evidence of my abduction. There on my lower back was a triangle with two rectangle shaped imprints on my back. They were the same size as the needle on the table. In the middle of the triangle was a small spot of clotted blood. I removed the spot of blood only to discover that there was no entry hole, just dried blood and the three imprints. My back was slightly swollen and did hurt a little bit. I took of my shirt to look and see if blood was also on it. There was none, it was only on my back.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,34.48760153846154,-97.85466307692307

Incidentally, as a commercial pilot, I have flown this route from Oklahoma City to Roswell, NM about 50 times.   Nothing like this has ever happened before. On the afternoon of Oct. 29, 1997, I flew my three teenagers from Shawnee, Ok. to Roswell, N.M., to attend their Grandmothers funeral. (My ex-wife's mother)  I dropped them off at the airport, had my aircraft refueled, and departed Roswell at approx. 1600 Mountain daylight time.   (ROW tower should have the exact departure time in their logs.  My aircraft registration number is N9229A) I climbed to a cruising altitude of 9,500 feet, and settled in for the three and a half  hour, non-stop flight back to Shawnee, Ok.  The sun set about an hour later, and left me with a beautiful, star lit night, tail winds, and no turbulence.  Two hours into the flight, at approx. 1900 CDT, and about 10-20 miles north of Childress, Tx.,  (I was at 70 DME southwest of the Hobart VOR, on the 240 radial) I saw what at first I thought to be a ""falling star"".   I was amazed that it didn't burn up in the first second or two after becoming visible, while traveling from an extremely high altitude, nearly vertical towards the ground.  I remember thinking to myself that I could have made a wish on this one!   The object descended vertically until reaching my altitude, when it suddenly leveled off, and while traveling from east to west, still at what I would have to call 'meteorite speed', veered slightly to the north, before arcing back to the south, on a direct collision course with my! aircraft.  I remember at this point, saying to myself in awe two or three times, that nothing goes this fast!!!    As the object approached my airplane at very high speed, it appeared to grow from 'shooting star size',  until it was about the size of a beach ball held at arms length, when I in a panic, banked hard to the right, (taking the object out of my field of view) to avoid a ""collision"".   I never saw the object again after that.   I wanted to call Fort Worth Center (ATC) to see if they had ""painted any targets"" in my area, but was so shaken up by the event, that when I tried to find the frequency on my charts, it was simply too overwhelming to look at the charts, and control the airplane at the same time.  I was about 60 miles west of Altus AFB, so it is possible the control tower saw this same object.  I'm certain it at least streaked from east to west that far.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,34.3673,-100.3565

Multiple lights surrounded the perimeter (reddish/orange) and varied in intensity.  The dark outline of the superstructure could be seen outlined by the lights.  Object was 200-250 yards from our position of observation.  No sound eminated from the object and there was no other noise (cars, planes, stereos, etc.) at the time.  It was very quiet.  Object was pursued in a vehicle but sighting was not regained.  Various news reports speculated that the sighting was due to Leonid Meteor shower or a Russion spacecraft reentering earths atmosphere.  Meteors do not fly subsonically in formation horizontally for 10 seconds.  It was not that.  While there was a Russian spacecraft that did reenter the earths atmosphere and was seen by many people on the west coast at about this time, the reckage supposedly ended up in the Pacific ocean.

We heard about the 9 PM Oregon, Washington, and Reno sightings of UFOs and this sort of confirmed our sightings and wondered if they were related.  We kept hearing about triangular shaped objects being sited so we were observing the sky.  The moon was unusually bright that morning.  When I got into Reno, I was headed south on Highway 395 toward our destination and I saw three dots of light that was about 30 degrees from the horizon almost directly toward the south.  The three lights looked like stars but were unusually bright.  I have been star gazing for a couple of years since my wife and I have been interested in UFOs.  I've witnessed the landing of the Space Shuttle above the skies in Vallejo.  I also saw the Mir streak across the sky one evening when a local newscaster told me when and where to look for the Mir.  I tried to get a better view and get closer to the lights but the three lights moved toward the west and one of the lights went behind Mount Rose near Lake Tahoe.  We went climbing near Mt Rose about three weeks earlier so we were familiar with locations. The strange thing was the exact symmetry of the three points of light from each other as they slowly moved across the sky.  It seemed like they were guided exactly by the movement of the other lights.  We got out of the car and I took photos and I'm not sure if they will come out.  I should get the photos back on Tuesday.  As my wife and I looked at the two lights as they hovered behind Mt Rose, the right most light flared up in brightness and appeared like it got brighter, then suddenly dimmed.  The lights appeared to me to about 100 miles south west of Reno, somewhere above the Sierras in California.  It could be deceiving and the objects even further out like hundreds of miles.  It is hard to tell unless someone triangulates the movements as I described them.  Now my wife and I and the kids are convinced that we are not alone in this galaxy.  The numerous reports of triangle shaped objects may have merit If I am correct, the object could be miles across and may be cloaked.   The tips of the triangle are the size of stars to throw off our perception and blend in with the stars at night.  Without a telescope, it was difficult to determine if  these were craft that were navigating and controlled by equidistance between each other or one huge vessel. We were excited and contacted the local TV news stations but no one called us back.  You are our only hope to describe this UFO.  Please advise what to do next.

While driving at dusk my daughter and I noticed an airplaine flying up in the sky w/ it's lights on heading in an easternly dirtection ,North Kingstown,RI,1997-11-21T17:00:00,triangle,10sec or less,"Occurred : 11/21/1997 17:00 Reported: 12/8/1997 06:51 Posted: 1/28/1999 Location: North Kingstown, RI Shape: Triangle Duration:10sec or less",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02965.html,"Summary : While driving at dusk my daughter and I noticed an airplaine flying up in the sky w/ it's lights on heading in an easternly dirtection to Green Airport.  We were driving on route 1 heading north onto route 4 Just as we came to a location on rt.4 near a combination miniture golf/batters cages/golf hitting range that is when we noticed the airplaine w/ it's lights on.  In this same are there are no tall trees and the area has a considerable panoramic view.  The air plaine was a couple hundred feet in the air, and I had a view of about  100 to 120 degrees.  A friend of mine has informed that jet airliners go a maximum speed of about 200-250 mph.  I would assume that the airplane was going less than 200 mph if it was heading for a landing at green.  No sooner than I had seen this plane I then saw another plane above the 1st,  it was 2 time the hight of the 1st it too had its lights on and both had a triangular look to then. BUT as I watched both airplane's the 2nd passed the 1st as if it was standing still.  W/ in  5 seconds it was compleatly out of my sight as it to headed easterly direction. I would estimate that the other plane?!?!? was going about 10 time the speed of the 1st.  Even my youg daughter mentioned ""look at that dad"" I have a back ground in science/natural history.  I have seen the jets at the airshows in the summer at Quonsett base at the old sea-bees base.  The only time I have ever seen them disappeare that fast, they were close to the  ground.  I would estimate that both objects were about 1000 feet to 1/2 a mile away. Since it was dusk and dark I could not see  much except that both had a grey outline and both had their lights on.  dividing my windsheld up into 10 units by the time the 1st airplaine went one unite the second had disappeared.  I would basicly estimate that the 2nd object/plane was going 10 times the speed of the 1st. So if the 1st plane was going about 180 to 200 mph then the 2nd""plane/object"" was going about  1800 to 2000 mph or more.  I have never seen a ""plane"" dissapear from my field of view like that in my life.  I have never seen a ufo in my life but because of the speed that this ""plane""  was  going and that it dissapeared out of my viewing area w/in 5 + seconds I thought I should report this. I do not want to leave my name because I have heard about another person who has witnessed triangular and cigar shaped ufo's here in RI and that this same person who has recorded these ufo's, has since reported them on line.  I was also told that since this person reported these sightings several months later but use his own computer.  Later I was told that the ufo reporter was literally  visited by people in a white lincoln and the 'visitors' were taking pictures of this persons house.  These visitors stoped the picture taking only after having their picture taken by the person who made the ufo reporting.  I was also told that the visitors inthe white lincoln had no plates on it at all, because they had watched it arrive and leave.  In fact on its way in twords this persons house, a cop had stoped the white lincoln and then left the lincoln alone. Depending who these people  in the white lincoln are be it ""men in black"" or ""government military personell"" I for one do not want my life subject to what ever hell these people put  ufo reporters through. All my daughter knows of ufo's is what she saw in the men in black video, I don't want her or myself subjected to anysort of ""interogation terror tactics"".  I asked her about the ""fast plane "" we saw the previous week and she didn't remember the sighting that we had made at all. Anon. in RI",1999-01-28T00:00:00,41.5877,-71.4623

I also thought it was a plane going to the San Jose or SFO Airport until it flew over me. At that point I noticed it was going too slow to be an airplane, although my friend said ""wow a stealth bomber!"". There was no sound, it was very low, very large and moved slowly over us, over my house toward the Santa Cruz Mountains. Once over the mountains it would be in the San Jose area. There were very large unblinking lights on each tip that showed the shape of the craft as it flew overhead as a triangle. I wish I spent more time observing it but since my friend said ""stealth bomber"" that's what I thought it was.  It was only later I realized a stealth bomber would probably be going much faster, be flying much higher, and make noise.

It was tan and wing shaped and seemed to go in and out of vision when looked at directly.  Merely a curiosity at this point - it flew with some of the characteristics of a hawk, but was much too high and rigid.    I observed it for about fifteen minutes in this holding pattern before it disappeared completely.    I left the park and drove towards town.  At the corner of Mesquite Springs Road and Twentynine Palms Highway I saw what I believe to be the same object at a very low altitude, maybe 50 feet, flying very slow southbound parallel to Mesquite Springs Road towards me.  It was about 100 yards away at this time.  I pulled off the road to get a better look because it was very unique looking.  It looked kind of like a flying wing, with no tail and no propeller, with a slightly raised fuselage in the center.  Golden tan on the bottom and off white on the top, dull with no reflection in the clear desert sun.  No markings that I could see.  I don't remember seeing any windows, but have an impression of a darker area near the front where you would expect windows.  It was somewhat larger than a piper aircraft, and had pronounced fins on the wing tips.    When I got out of my truck it was not readily in sight.  From the slowness of it I expected to see it right above me.  My son pointed it out traveling East above Twentynine Palms and climbing, already about 3 miles away.  Very fast.  I heard no sound from this craft whatsoever when it turned and accellerated.  It passed out of sight in seconds.  Visibility-unlimited.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,,

We were four people having a meeting at my beach front property at Paraparaumu Beach.  When we went outside on the balcony to have a smoke, we noticed a beam of light behind Kapiti Island.  This is not necessarily unusual as sometimes Sea and Rescue Searches with Helicopters produce similar visual effects.  However, standing there arguing why S&R was called out again, we noticed that the colour of the light changed from the usual bright white to an alteration at low frequency of a dull, surealistic green and pink.  Slowly, the source of the greenish light appeared to rise from behind Kapiti Island.  At this stage, we could not make out the body of the object emitting the light nor could we hear any sounds.  The objects movement appeared to be relatively slow.  When the light changed to pink, we briefly noticed that the source of the pink light was positioned behind the source of the green light making a huge squshed cylindrical object in front of it visible for a couple of seconds.  Unfortunately, the pink beam of light and the object in front of it synchroneously set slowly behind Kapiti Island.

At first I thought I lost it behind a tree that was obstructing my view. But Iwaited and the object never came back into view even when I moved to different viewpoints . It was very clear that night and I looked all around and there wasnt a    plane in sight. The object had dissappeared without a trace. I went outside to walk my dog when I spotted the light. It was about the size of half a penny held at arms length. It was yellowish-orangish in color. It made no sound or smell. It was moving at about the same speed a commercial airplane does. I spotted it in the southeastern sky and it was moving in a southwesternly direction. It was visible for about 2-5 minutes before it vanished. It was a very clear sky that night about as clear as it gets around here. I think its altitude was about 100ft to 200ft. It was oval or almond shaped. I thought it was a airplane until it dissappeared. This is my third sighting all in Southgate comunity in Glen Burnie MD.. My mother witnessed the second sighting (two craft). This sighting was only seen by myself.,1999-01-28T00:00:00,39.16191335403727,-76.61320652173914

Chased by two Ohio Air National Guard F-16's. On or about 02/15/98 at approximately 23:35 Hrs. I observed a large Charcoal gray to Black UFO. This craft was slowly traversing the sky from North East to South West at between 1000 to 1500 feet in altitude. There was a very low more felt then heard rumbling coming from the craft as it moved. It was approximately 100 to 150 feet long, and 100 feet wide at it's widest point. There were three strobing lights shifting from dull green to bright blue on this craft. One at each of its three tips. I would estimate the crafts origanal speed at between 150 and 200 MPH. This sighting took place within hearing distance of the local Airport extimated range to the airport is from 3 to 5 miles maybe more. As I spent 21 years in the military I know the sound of Combat Aircraft as they take off under full military power with after burners. I heard two Ohio Air National Gaurd F-16's take off from the Toledo Express Airport and head in the direction of the Unknown. Both F-16's passed directly over head I could clearly see they were both armed with two each AIM-9 Sidewinder Air to Air Heat Seeking Missles. As the two F-16's approched the craft it looked to me as if they were attempting to get a weapons lock. The large Unknow suddely increased it's speed to well over supersonic but without the resultent sonic boom. It then tilted upward at I would say an almost 90 degree angle and continued to excelerate. Both F-16's attemped to stay with and chase the craft but they were quickly out distanced. I continued to watch as they both broke off persute and circled back returning to their base at Toledo Express Airport. Again I state that the craft made a very low possibly subsonic rumbling sound that I felt more then heard. I would discribe it's shape as the same as the expiremental XF-16XL the Cranked Arrow (An expierimental Delta wing configuration of the F-16 Fighting Falcon. I should also note that my 21 years in the military was spent in and around the intelligence community. For 20 of thoes years I held a Top Secret Security clearance with several special compartmented acsesses granted. For the last 6 years I have worked as a private security officer and investigator. I do not know if there have been any other reports of this craft nor do I know if anyone else saw what I saw. I watched the newspapers and the television for any reports of this incident and I have yet to see any it is almost as if it never happend.

The flasing continued a few more seconds, was as bright as lightening: air temp. 39f; pressure 29.90.  We later learned that a powerline had been severed at the junction of Highway 61 and the Ryan Road - 15 miles up the shore of Lake Superior from central downtown Duluth.  It seem to us that a rather large craft may have come a bit too close to ground and that some form of its propellent energy caused the power line to snap.

These lights made several odd manuvers and never flashed or blinked; we are realatively close to Port Columbus so, I am used to seeing airplanes and helicopters yet, I have never seen anything like this. The long, bright white light was odd because it seemed to be close and flying very low,( 20-40 ft.), and even though this was a very intense bright white light it cast no light on surrounding objects. I could see the trees in my neighbor's yard silohetted against the light as it moved across the neighbor's yard. This object was about as long as the first joint of your finger,( from the tip of your finger to the first knuckle), held at arms length - as I sat about 22 ft. from the window that I saw it through. The triangular shaped object that I saw after I got up and went to the window appeared over the intersection of Morse & Westerville Roads at an altitiude of about 100-150 ft. and headed due North, in my general direction. Once it got slightly North of Morse Rd.,( which runs E & W), it banked slightly and headed west, the whole time going about 25-35 mph. The object traveled West until it was 200 ft. or so past Westerville Rd. then, came to a stop rotated 180 degrees and began flying back East at about the same speed as before. When the object got back to where it origanally began moving to the West it suddenly got a burst of speed like nothing I've ever seen and made a U-turn that seemed to take it slightly higher and its own width to the South. This U-turn was one of the main things that made me stop and think "" Hey this is not a helicopter or airplane"" because, just last year I went to the Dayton Airshow and saw how fast these modern millitary planes can accelerate. Let me tell you nothing I have ever seen could do this- not to mention the g-forces this manuver would have exerted on a pilot would have been more than any human could ever stand. After this abrupt U-turn the object immediately returned to its previous snail like speed and continued on to the West. As it got about 300 ft. or so from Westerville Rd. it slowly turned to the South South West and as it made this turn all the lights instantly turned red but, there was no blink or flash as though I was seeing a different side of the object, the lights just simply switched colors!!!! After the object had changed course and color it just flew at the same slow speed out of my field of view to the Southwest. This triangular object seemed to emmit a wide, highly despirsed light at about a 45 degree angle, from the front yellow light- this light is totally different than a normal search light on a helicopter. It also seemed like there was a triangular shadow inbetween the lights so that since the sky was overcast the clouds were slightly brighter than the object itself- so, it was possible to make out the shape but, there was only a slight hint of it. The object appeared to be an equilateral triangle of about 50-75 ft. per side. I also stuck my head out the door during the sighting and heard no sound, other than the usual traffic sounds, and there was no change in the object's appearance.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,40.0034168732507,-82.99822087165134

Under the craft there were three rectangle shapes ,  one in the front, two in the back these were of a very dim red color, I would not have been able to see this craft at all If my eyes were not adjusted to the darkness.  this craft flew directly over the camp ground and was heading straight for sturgis, now I was there for the Bike rally, so I am assuming that this event was the atraction of the craft, I also believe that this craft is man made, possibly military or some powerfull corperate entity, there is no question that this was an unconventional craft, and I am assuming that the rectangular objects under the craft are the propulsion units possibly EMP style",,44.4192,-103.2643

This happened when I was in the 4th Grade.  I'm now 46.  My father was an NCO in the U.S. Army stationed at the NATO base in Baumholder, and I was his dependent. I'm sure this story is of little use to you save as a curiosity at this point, but I've never written it down or reported it to anyone prior to this. This was a very clear, bright day.  There were not haze or clouds. I was between classes after lunch. A friend and I were looking out the class window over the town of Baumholder. I observed a rather bright object coming towards the school.  It was curving in from what must have been the NNW heading towards the SW.  Because of its arc I was able to see at different times its port and starboard sides as well as it's bottom. There was no way to gauge altitude, so I couldn't tell you what its size was.  Likewise, couldn't estimate speed, although it seemed to be in no hurry. We thought at first that it was an airplane.  We began to joke about the Russians (remember where I was, and that it was 1962). As it came closer, nearly overhead the school, I began to realize that it was not a plane and that I had never seen anything like it before.  We gradualy became silent with out joking. It had no wings, empenage, or markings.  It made no vapor trail and had no exhaust.  I saw nothing to suggest an engine, cockpit, or windows. I'd seen a lot of planes and helicopters in my young life (Army brat).  It was not a plane or helicopter.  Neither was it a blimp, balloon, kite, gyrocopter, or droud. It made no noise that I could hear.  It seemed quite graceful.  It looked like nothing so much as a flying florescent light.  It was long, but cut off very cleanly and abruptly on both of its ends.  It's lines were exceptionaly well-defined.  It seemed seamless. It did not seem metallic.  It did not seem to reflect the sun.  It had a very curious dull, off-white, glow to it, not bright, but very steady and uniform. It looked as if someone had taken a cookie-cutter and stamped out neatly a portion of the sky. I lost sight of it when it eventually flew beyond the vantage of my window. I can attest that I have never seen anything like this since, and I've looked. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date so the report sorts to the spring of 1962.  PD))",,,

The object kept getting closer as it was heading our direction.  We pulled over off an exit ramp and observed the triangular shaped object silently hovering overhead. One night, years ago, sometime between 1967/68, while driving home from a movie with my younger brother and my best friend (actually, my friend was driving, I was the front sea passenger), I observed a bright light in the distance making some very impressive, yet highly unorthodox, movements across the distant sky.  As we continued to observe and we realized we were approaching the object and that it was heading our way too.  The strange motion behavior I'm referring too, is it would appear to quickly race across the sky, come to a virtual standstill, then quickly dash across the sky in another completely different direction, where it would once again appear to just halt in the sky.  It was a single bright light and did not have any flashing lights (typical of conventional aircraft).  This observational phase went on for a few minutes.  Eventually, we realized it was getting real close as we pulled off the highway exit ramp and pulled over.  We were in an old ragtop VW so we didn't even have to get out of the car to witness what we then saw.  Much to our astonishment, virtually hovering right over our head @ approximately 500-1,000 feet was a single, black, triangle shaped object.  It had lights on each of its three tips, but none of them blinked, and they were all white/yellow in color.  Needless to say, we were all blown away.  We had never seen or heard of anything like what we were now observing.  As we watched, the object literally just floated silently overhead in a very small circle course, right overhead.  I remember verbally describing it in detail to my friend, so we could both validate we were observing, as frankly, it was very difficult to believe, event though we were all seeing ith with our own eyes.  It was black, and totally silent.  It would just slowly hover overhead or just come to a complete standstill.  Becasue it was a clear night and the visibility was good, we could clearly see that it did not have wings and it certainly was no helicopter or any other conventional aircraft.  It w! as simply a black triangle with no markings or flashing lights of any kind.  It was completely silent in the quiet night sky; no prop sounds; no jet sounds.  After watching it for a few minutes, it quit circling overhead and started to fly away slowly.  Then, as quickly as you could blink your eye, it suddenly just shot off into the night sky faster than a bullet, without so much as emitting a single sound.  It was truly an astonishing event to observe.  We were all excited and drove home where we told our story to my disbeleining mom and dad.  I actully called the local police dept. and Miami International airport to tell them what we saw and ask them if they had seen the object or traced it on radar.  Both indicated that they didn't have a clue about what I described. None-the-less, my friend, my brother, and I all knew what we saw, and it was very real, and it wasn't anything that we knew existed in conventional aircraft.  Over the years, I learned to just remain silent on the subject, as the usual response was one of disbelief.  Frankly, that didn't bother me too much, because had I not seen what I saw with my own eyes, I too would've had a very hard time believing it.  Then, I saw a special on TV recently (where I got your webpage info) and was totally blown away to discover that other people had also seen triangular UFOs!  Prior to that, I thought all UFOs were circular or cigar shaped, as that's mostly what was represented in the various UFO books that I had stumbled on over the years.  However, I must confess, that I have always been an airplane bluff and have kept pretty current over the years, so I was totally blown away when I first saw our F-117 Stealth plane.  It made me wonder, ""where did the air force come up with that idea/design?""  Also, I have since actually seen the F-117 and though my memory has definitely faded some over the years, I'd guess that the physical size of the triangle we saw, was about the size of an F-117.  However, what we saw was definitely NOT an F-117, as they can hove! r and they are louder than hell.  Needless to say, I am convinced that what we saw over 30 years ago was definitely not of this earth.",,25.9863,-80.1518

It was completely silent. If there was sound, none could be heard. Speed between 3-5mph moving slowly. In 1967 I was 14 years of age. I am now 46. Am not sure of the exact date because that exact information was lost long ago. I did write it down after it happened and drew a sketch. They (NASA) had just launched a sattelite that morning and we(the neighborhood gang) a small group of five kids including myself (me the oldest) were outside at the corner of N.W.9th Street and 42nd ave. Gainesville, Florida looking at the sky to see if we could observe the sattelite go across the sky. We had seen them before and knew what they were---a light white in color that looked like a star way up there moving much faster than a jetplane in a straight path across the sky. Anyway all we saw at first was stars--the sky was clear--no clouds.... This was on a night where us kids had school the next morning and although it was just after dark, we were stretching our time outside before our parents actually made us come inside for the night. The kennedy Space Center is not terribly far as the crow flies and when the sky is clear, we can easily see the space shuttle shortly after it is launched. But back then there was no shuttle. We could hear a single engine plane landing at the Gainesville airport less than five miles away. I was looking off to the north east and one of the other kids excitedly said ""Hey! Look at that...It's as big as a Battleship!!!!"" (Well, it wasn't as big as a battleship, but there was a large dark object coming our way just above the trees probaly no more than 100ft up at the most and 50-60ft at the least.) When I first looked over to my left to the north the first thing I noticed was some Red glowing lights moving towards us thru the trees. As this thing came out from behind the trees to the clear area over the road we were standing on then we got a clear view of it. Looking at it from directly underneath, it was a dark solid triangle and from my memory thru all these years, each side was of equal length. there was a round red softly glowing light on each corner so that if the lights were not exactly ! on each corner they were very close to the point of each corner. These lights were no more than three feet in diameter, possibly a little smaller 1-1/2--2ft in dia. They were not reflecting off the underside of the object. There was NO SOUND. We were not afraid, but I said ""Lets get your parents"" and we started running south down NW9th street (the same street we were at the north end of---The same street that my friends lived on) We were able to run ahead of the object so it couldn't have been moving more than 5mph...It was coming the same direction (south) not directly over 9th street, and not directly over the homes on 9th, but between the street and their front yards. By the time we ran the distance of about 5 homes and quickly got my friends parents out of the house to observe this, this thing had reached our position. The Two parents saw it too as it came over us again. After we raise a fuss over this thing it seemed to rise up higher and level off at maybe a hundred feet or mor higher than we first saw it and it continued on. It never went any faster, but the farther away it got it simply blended in with the sky-- the farther away it got , the harder it was to see until we coult not see it any more. although with binoculars it would have been observable for longer.I could type more details.... but I'm getting tired for now-- I could answer more details easier in person, because there is more to this story as it continues 11 years later-- not with me but someone else and about 60 miles away in Ocala National Forest over State road 19.",,29.646086792452827,-82.38107610062893

I called for my mother who was just inside our house in the kitchen, and she came outside, I ran to to back our our yard in excitment looking up, my mother ran to me , and the craft passed slowly over our heads at a very slow speed, My recall, being young is that it was grey on the bottom, flat, no sound, was maybe 100 ft long, 50 ft wide, My mother to this date remembers the same though she recalls lights, and a low humming noise, as it left our yard crossing over to the next yard , that leads to a crossing of a street, that brings it over my school yard, I remember it seemed to be there , then gone , then there, but maybe 50 ft futher away, at this time it was directly over a large tree, in the middle of the large open school yard, at this time, wanting to see more I ran to my bike at the back of our house to pursue the craft, my mother was yelling for me to come back, caught in the moment , I preceded to ride my bike down around the corner to the school yard to see more, as I aprouched the scool yard , I could see two young friends that lived 4 houses behind ours riding thier bikes along the backside near trees of the schoolyard chasing what apeared to be the same thing, we met up at the top of a small hill near a tree line that leads to waht is called crandal park, we jumped off our bike ,still seeing this object still in viewover the tree line. we ran in under the trees and then it was gone.

It was a somewhat overcast night, and the lights of the town and airport were visible to my left as my girlfriend and I drove north on Interstate 95 towards Orono.  I noticed a flashing out of the corner of my eye and turned to see a white pulsing, circling flash moving VERY quickly across the sky in a southerly direction.  It pulsed intermittently, looking very much like a strobe but a bit slower.  It was out of site in only a few seconds, but the speed it moved at was not explainable by normal aircraft, nor was the strength of the light.  There was no plane attached to the light - just the light.  I saw a plane not a few minutes before that.  I told my girlfriend to look, but it was already out of site and she discounted it.  It was apparently close, only a few hundred feet up and it moved by flashing along, sort of in an incredibly gentle U-fashion to the south.

We were driving south on Semoran Blvd. near the airport in Orlando when we turned east toward a restaurant. In the eastern sky, at approx. 40 degrees above the horizon, there were two spherical objects emitting a bright white light.  The objects were clearly defined with a haze surrounding them.  The closest analogy I can think of is the appearance of a flashlight in fog.  The sky was generally clear and the airplanes preparing for landing were clearly distinguishable. The airplane lights did not exhibit this same haze so I don't think the haze surrounding the spheres was the result of any cloud cover.  The two objects were hovering near each other but at slightly different elevations.  The sphere to the left was slightly elevated over the right sphere.  We slowed down to watch the objects, initially assuming that it was some unannounced launch from KSC.  However, the objects didn't move. They appeared to hover in the same position.  This period was long enough for us to observe them and conjecture as to what we were seeing.  The two objects disappeared suddenly.  When we got to the restaurant parking lot, several other people were standing around discussing what we had just seen. Orlando news covered the reports and showed video taken in Ft. Myers.  This video is an accurate representation of what we saw in Orlando.  Local news also reported that Patrick Air Force Base released a statement that the objects were the result of ""naval operations"".  They gave no further expanation.

My attention was drawn to two bright white lights aboput 30 degrees above the horizon and visible in my windshield.  They were strangely out of focus or hazy.  They moved independently from one another, i.e. they tilted.  Each was more or less formless, but also strangely each seemed to have a shaft of light pointing down as though each light was fastened to the bottom of an aircraft and pointed straight down.  But the shafts of light were not vertical cylindars, but truncated cones of white light.  Neither pointed down very far.  I estimated that they were less than one mile away and perhaps 2000 feet high, given their brightness.  I became concerned tgaht I would drive under them and lose sight of them, but it did not occur to me to stop off the highway and get out to look up. As I drew closer they were higher in my windshield, so I moved forward against the steering wheel to keep them in sight.  Before I reach my turn off the right hand light faded and disappeared, then the second light faded and disappeared.  They were rather peculiar, so I was at first reluctant to tell my wife, but I finally did before we went out for the evening.  I checked the sky as we left home about 7:30 but they were not to be seen.  I was relieved to see a haze in the sky then, as that would explain their foggy or out of focus appearance.

Visual angle on the object was about 85 deg above horizon.  Object appeared to be silver sphere, moving from North to South.  Sighting started & ended about 45 deg to either side of zenith.  Two delta-wing fighters (considering the year probably F102s) trailed yhe onject (in terms of flight path), with distance between the object anbd the fighters increasing -- ie, object appeared to be faster than fighters. Object was *not* a reflection from a conventional airplane.  The angle between the sun (cloudless day) changed markedly between beginning & ending of sighting, but the appearance of the object as a silvery sphere did not vary. Also, the fighters were always visible as conventional aircraft throught the sighting. The question, of course, is:  what was the actual altitude of the UFO? If at the fighter's altitude or greater, it was going faster than the fighters.  If less than the altitude of the fighters, it could have been slower than the fighters -- and if enough lower, could have been a balloon.

It was almost on top of my truck.  They were observing me and had forced me pull over. One Sunday evening in the winter of 1970 about 7:pm, I had decided to go to my fathers house which was only about 6 or 7 miles away.  I turned left off Hy. 60 which led me south on a rural road.  I had proceeded no more than about 100 yds. when I was stopped by what ap- peared to be police lights.  Having pulled over, I looked back and was perplexed not to see a police car. (I thought it was the local pol- ice because I was now in the city limits of town.)  I thought per- haps I had been speeding or something.  At that moment, the interior of my pickup was flooded with light.  I then realized that a ufo had pulled me over by using simulated police lights and that they were now observing me.  The craft was by now very visible and exceedingly close.  It was about 50 yds. off to my right and about a telephone poles' height from ground level.  It was very luminous and quite large; as big as a football field.  It seemed to be constructed of a shiny material somewhat like aluminum and was the typical saucer shape.  (Like two saucers put together.)  I observed the craft for a few moments and left as I had read of abductions and I didn't want to be in that category. (scared stiff)  I saw no aliens. There were several things about this sighting that to me were peculiar.  The first was the use of police lights and the second was the fact that this happened in a well-populated area (a church and hospital were nearby) as well as in a residential area.  Also, the craft appeared suddenly and disappeared just as quickly.  (It didn't just fly in or out, it literally disappeared.)  There was absolutely no sound of any kind. I would like to point out that I have never been prone to hallucinations and have always been a very moderate drinker. (At this particular time I didn't drink at all and in any event I have never drank so much that I would see things like that.)

At least 2 football fields long. Altitude approx. 500 ft. Observed moving slowly westerly direct. No lights. No sound. Underlit by city lights. My sighting took place in the early seventies, in Salinas, California.  I think I was about 15 or so.  It late and I didn't feel like going to bed, so I decided to do some stargazing.  I grabbed a soda, and tossed a folding chaise lounge chair up onto the garage roof to lay back on.  After being up there for a short time, I noticed movement in the eastern sky.  It was not a moving point of light that I saw, but rather an area of stars being blocked out by a huge object moving slowly across the night sky.  At first I thought it was a blimp, but quickly dismissed this when I realized that it was much too large.  The best way to describe the object is to say that it looked much like a naval battleship turned upside down, only a little more rounded at the ends.  It displayed no lights of it's own, but I was able to observe the underside as it had become dimly lit by the city lights.  The thing that was really weird about this craft, was the fact that it moved in total silence.  At one point, it was no more than 500 feet almost directly above me. I heard nothing from it.  The object continued moving slowly in a westerly direction towards the ocean, and disappeared from sight.     I am 42 years old, married 18 years, and the father of six.  Up until now, the only people I've told of this were my parents, my wife and kids, and my best friend.  I'm not saying that I've ever been abducted, but when I think back, there were some pretty weird things that happened to me during my childhood.  I can remember being scared in the middle of the night, and getting out of bed.  I remember looking down the darkened hallway, and seeing a small figure backlit at the end of the hall.  I remember the figure appearing startled.  I didn't recall anything after that, and dismissed it as a dream. When I awoke in the morning.  Another time, I awoke in the middle of the night to see a small hooded figure kneeling by my bed.  When I moved, the figure stood up.  It was wearing a long, hooded robe, much like what a monk would wear.  In ! the darkness, I could not see a face.  This really freaked me out, and I snatched the covers up over my head.  The next morning, I asked my parents if either of them had checked on me during the night.  They said they had not.  My mom said that maybe it was an angel, so that's what I told myself to keep sane as I grew up.  The last weird thing I'd like to mention about my childhood, is a small metallic object I noticed under the skin of my outer thigh.  I say it was metallic, as it was just under the skin to the point where I could tell it was grey metal color.  I don't remember how it got there.  I remember telling my friends that it was there from getting shot with a pellet gun, and that he pellet was still there, although in fact, I was never shot.  the small ""thing"" is gone now, and there is no scar.  I've never really put all this weird stuff together until the last 10 or 15 years.  I kind of look at it as all being pretty circumstantial.  I have, and do experience sleep paralysis from time to time.  I know what that is.  REALLY scary, but I don't remember being beamed up to a mothership or any of that stuff.  I've lived a pretty normal, relatively uneventful life.  I've got some baggage, like most people do, but nothing related to my sighting and the few unexplained occurrences of my childhood.  I don't think I'm an abductee or anything.  If I am, I don't think I want to know the details !",1999-04-02T00:00:00,36.688524576271185,-121.62845480225988

I was listening to Mr. Davenport on Jeff Rense's show tonight, (3/19/99) and heard him say that he does want ""old"" UFO sighting reports to add to the data banks.  I thought of calling in to the show, but decided to write it down instead.  I thank you for this opportunity to tell what my children and I saw over 25 years ago. On October 12, 1973, our family consisting of me, my husband, our sons aged 14, 13 and 9 and our daughter aged 7, were nearing the end of our 4 year residence in Birmingham, Alabama.  We were packing for a move to Scottsdale, Arizona, and on that day my husband was away on a trip to Arizona to set up details of the move.  It was Homecoming for my oldest son's highschool and he and his next younger brother wanted to go to the football game.  Just after 7:00 pm I loaded all four kids into the LTD station wagon for the 2 mile drive to the stadium.  My daughter was in the front seat with me and the 3 boys were in the back. Our street was a long one-block cul de sac on the side of a hill.  When leaving the street you have to climb up a steep incline, south, to the main cross-street at the top.  The 2 streets form a ""T.""  Across the intersection from our street was a heavily wooded area with no visible houses or lights. Our duplex was about halfway down the block on the east side of the street. Shortly after I pulled out of our driveway and headed up the hill, a huge, green-glowing hamburger lifted out of the trees across the intersection and slowly moved toward our car.  Because of its low altitude and the steepness of the hill, the sight seemed to fill up our whole windshield.  I called it a ""hamburger"" because that best describes the shape of the craft as I remember it.  It appeared to be a solid dark metal ship with a row of lights and/or windows around the middle. The whole UFO was surrounded by a luminescent green mist.  As it moved, some of the mist was left behind. As you can imagine, we were stunned and terrified.  Thankfully, I did not lose electrical or engine power in the car.  I turned left into the closest driveway, whipped that station wagon around as fast as I could, and headed for home, all the while screaming to the kids, ""Is it following us?!?""  They were as hysterical as I was.  This thing was monstrously close. Within seconds I had pulled into our driveway and all of us got out of the car to look at the UFO.  It had risen a bit higher in the sky and changed direction from its original northerly path.  It was now slowly drifting to the southeast, leaving green mist in the sky as it went. There was NO sound. I ran to the duplex to the south of our building and pounded on the back door.  When the young woman tenant came to the door I excitedly told her to come out and see what we were witnessing.  Of course, by the time she came outside there was nothing left to see but the green mist.  My kids had been keeping it in sight and told me that it just suddenly disappeared. The mist stayed suspended in the sky for several minutes before dissipating. I do not know if there was anything of substance that might have fallen to the ground for collection.  I certainly saw nothing the next day in the daylight. I herded my children into our house and attempted to calm them (and myself) down.  I gave them all paper and pencils and instructed them to draw what they had seen.  (Those drawings were long ago destroyed, but I do remember that they were all remarkably similar.) I got out the phone book to try to find somebody to tell what we had seen.  Nobody. In 1973 I knew nothing about MUFON or any other UFO research entities. So, I called the nearest municipal police department in Vestavia Hills, Alabama.  (We did not live within the city limits of Birmingham.)  The polite, but obviously amused officer who answered the phone told me that he had had no other reports of odd things in the sky, and that what we had probably seen was ""an atmospheric gas bomb set off at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.""  I did not buy that explanation then, and I don't buy it now.  I cannot imagine that such a thing would have obvious solidity and lights or windows. Within a couple of weeks we left Alabama.  Because I was so busy with the details of our move I did not have time to do any investigation of the wooded area out of which that thing rose. I was nearly 7 years old at the time of the Roswell crash and remember my mother telling me about it at the time.  My interest in UFOs began then, but there was always a bit of doubt in my mind.  That doubt was erased on the night of October 12, 1973.  I remember that the first thought that popped in my head when I saw it was, ""They really DO exist!"" Our children each reacted differently to the adventure.  My youngest son was so traumatized he will not talk about it to this day.  The other boys and our daughter don't mind UFO conversations at all.  My oldest son has been known to tell about the experience at the drop of a hat.  Our daughter was affected the most by the incident.  She had encounters with UFOs and/or ETs after that time, and may still be experiencing strange incidents to this day.  She has some conscious memories that are very disturbing. We had no ""lost time"" that night.  After we had calmed down a bit, I actually put everybody back in the car and took the boys to the game.

I told them to ask people in the stands if they had seen anything, but of course they didn't do it. sure they didn't do it.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,33.48091579651941,-86.77946934404284

I was setting up my telescope ( huge 12.5 Meade light bucket ) with 20 year old son-in-law.  Night was especially clear and we were using my wide angle lense for moon viewing.  While I was focused on moon, SIL said, ""Hey whats that!""  I turned, followed his pointing and coming overhead was a fast moving object.  It appeared slightly slower than a falling comet, but faster than any jet.  It was a single dot of white light that went in a straight line, but stopped, started and repeated this several times while I wheeled my telescope around to catch a glimps of it.  My SIL kept it in constant view by his naked eye and I aligned the Dobson mount and pointed the scope skyward at the object. It was nearly at the end of the horizon when I believe I caught a glimps of it.  It was only a fraction of a second, but I believe it was longer than it was wide and bright metalic.  No other detail could be determined.  While explaining this to a friend the next day I was advised he was 1 of 4 on patrol at apx 0400 hrs. in foothills about 90 miles away.

I was doing my paper route early one morning in the San Diego area.  La Mesa is where I was, this is adjacent to San Diego on the east side.  I wasn’t aware of it at the time of the sighting, but there were a rash of UFO sightings in the area for a week or two after this sighting. 	There are a couple of maps included that show the locations of these events.  The intersection of Highland Ave. and Carter Pl. is on the top of a hill.  From this vantage point you can see all the way to the coast and up past what was then known as Miramar Naval Air Station.  It is a Marine Corp. Base now.  I was familiar with the normal flight patterns of commercial aircraft on their approach to Lindbergh Field and military aircraft around Miramar. On this particular morning, and as long ago as this happened I can’t even begin to tell you what day (or year) it was, I had started my paper route a little earlier than usual.  It was still dark that morning.  As I looked to the NW I saw in the distance a triangular grouping of red lights.  They were not blinking, but burning steady.  They were banked at a slight angle because I could see all three lights.  I thought that this was unusual, but it appeared to be over the MNAS area so I didn’t pay too much mind to it.  The altitude may have been around 1000 ft.  The intersection I mentioned above is at the top of a hill, there are two short  roads that dead-end to the side of Lee Street.  I had one or two deliveries on each road.  After completing the delivery on the first road (elapsed time may have been 1 min.) I returned to the intersection and glanced out towards the NW again.  This time I saw the same triangular pattern of red lights at the same angle but this time they were closer.  Still not blinking, just steady.  By now I was getting curious so I looked at them for a few seconds.  They didn’t seem to be moving much.  I went down the second road and delivered the other one or two papers and returned to the intersection to look at the object.  Elapsed time was again around a minute.  Now it was gone.  I sat there for a while looking around to see where it could have gone.  From this location I had a good view of the horizon and if this had been a plane on approach to Lindbergh Field I would have seen it for several minutes.  It was at this time that I realized that if this object had been a plane I either should have seen it on approach, or I should have heard it as it traveled behind me to the east.  My line of sight to the east was obstructed by the hill but I had a good view to the North, West and South. There were several reports of UFO sightings in the news after I had this sighting and it was at this time that I decided that this must have been a UFO as well.  I don’t recall all of the details, but one of the most credible sightings during this period was by an older lady who reported seeing a UFO land somewhere in the vicinity her home.  Investigators tested the depressions where the object supposedly landed and they calculated a significant weight had been placed there.  They ruled out a hoax because of the location of the landing sight and the difficulty of placing that much weight in that location.  The weight was somewhere in the several ton range if my memory serves me correctly. That’s the end of that.  If anybody recalls anything like this happening I would like to hear from you.

At the southwest corner of the valley, in the Santa Cruz range, sits Mt. Umnum.  Mt. Umnum was the sight of a very large and powerful US Air Force radar station. One clear cold autumn morning, I was sitting in my car, at the foot of Mt. Umnum, waiting for the rest of the crew to arrive, so we could begin our job of landscaping a new housing tract.  As the sun slowly began to ascend over the Hamilton range to the east, turning the sky above the still shadowy valley a bright blue, I noticed what appeared to be a morning star, or lingering planet above the fog enshrouded peak of Mt. Umnum.  As my gaze lingered upon the brightly shining object, I noticed that it appeared to be oscillating back and forth ever so slightly.   This immediately grabbed my attention, and as I now gazed intently at the object; it began to grow brighter, and appeared to get larger as it continued to oscillate ever so slightly. this process continued for about 2-3 minutes until the brightly shining object descended to the same altitude as the fog enshrouded radar station, and hovered there, still visible, about a half mile away from the station.  It hovered in this position for about 5 to 10 seconds, at which point it changed direction and headed directly for the radar station.  As it entered the fog bank, it literally burned a hole in the mist.  This hole lasted for several seconds before finally converging in on itself. This sighting leads me to believe that this particular fireball may have been of U.S. military origin, as the radar station was supposed to have a landing strip in it's proximity. The radar station has since been decommissioned.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,37.3388420218894,-121.88970568836406

The objects came in from the West, until they were over the house across the street at which time they made a leisurely turn to the North. I was at 97.08872W 32.75318N at the time, in fact, I still reside there. The objects were not at all impressive, being a gull grey in color and making no strange aerobatics. WEATHER CONDITIONS: Heavy Cloud : YES Dusk : YES Warm : YES UFO ACTIONS: Disappear/Reappear: YES Noise Info : NONE I have a book by Robert Emenegger called ""UFOs, Past, Present and Future,"" and it has a sighting survey based upon the Observer's Data Sheet prepared for the USAF. I filled it out at the time and am using it to provide the data I'm entering here. I still remember it well, and will attempt to properly describe it in words, though my drawing from the time would be of better use. My mother and grandparents first called the objects to my attention. I went outside and was joined by my sister, her friend and my brother. We all saw them, and I had all but my grandparents sign the sighting report as witnesses. Now, however, they have nearly, if not totally, forgotten the episode. When I got outside, I saw the objects coming in over the roof of the house to our left, westwards. I live on a Circle, with the entrance on the east connecting to a north-south road. Our house is on the south-east corner facing the connecting road with the driveway leading to the entrance to the circle, where we were all standing. When I saw the objects, I rushed inside to get my binoculars only to find that my sister had broken them from when she had last borrowed them; this is why the event is so prominent in my memory. I then got my telescope, a small thing from K-mart, maybe 50x, and dragged it outside. By the time I got back outside, the lead object was over the house across from our driveway, to the north, and had started its turn to the north. Now, to be honest, I would still swear that there were three of the things, but my notes from the time only indicate a single craft; not in so many words, but Question #10 of the sighting survey asks if there was more than one phenomenon, and I had left it blank. Other parts of the form are blank as well, but simply those things that I did not have data on at the time and never had a chance to fill in, so perhaps I had missed the question or some other event caused me to not enter more than one object. At any rate, I believe I saw three of them and will assume so in this report. I trained my ! telescope on the lead object and managed to get a lengthy view until it was just too much of a hassle keeping it in focus and trained, so I just used the Mark-1 eyeball until they went out of sight to the north. I had 8 minutes of clear view, except for my trip inside for my binoculars and telescope, before they disappeared into some clouds. There was only one star out at the time, and the moon wasn’t up until 9:30pm. The only other traffic I saw was an airplane on the opposite sky when the objects were almost out of view. I live near D/FW Airport, but it had only just opened back then and it’s a good bit away. Besides, I know aircraft, and was a member of the Air Force JROTC at my high school. I can’t think of any aircraft that would take 8minutes to travel a mile, give or take. To describe them, I think the best thing to do is to think of a Dorito chip with very rounded corners. Now, take the chip and bend the rounded corners up to form a shallow bowl shape. Put a small raised hump on top of the chip in the center (only just visible past the edge) and a small circular light on the bottom in each corner and that’s pretty much it. The view I had was a three-quarter view from the bottom, so all I saw of the seeming hump was just what poked over the edge. The bottom was very round as were the edges. The object was an overall grey, and the lights were pretty much just white spots, they weren’t bright at all, in fact, they weren’t even visible until I used the telescope and remains of my binoculars. The objects didn’t give off any light or sound and made a very slow leisurely trip across the sky; as I had said, nothing impressive at all. I still have the drawings of it, and can forward them in future if you so desire and I can get to a scanner. I reported the sighting to the police that same day, but I have no idea if they kept any record or anything. Well, that’s about it. I’ve tried to put down all I could think of and could find on that sighting survey, and I hope it helps. Feel free to contact me about it. Est. Height: 500 - 1000 feet Est. Speed: 5 - 10 MPH Est.

There was a time lapse involved between first sighting and take off. I was starting first grade, and remember this story well. Not knowing what i had seen, I described it to my classmates in full detail the next day, thereby I believe committing the encounter permanently to memory. I have not related this story to anyone else because, just telling my brothers about it, received so much skepticism that i allowed myself to just 'forget' that it ever happened. I am now 28 years old, have a BS in Computer Engineering, and am a partner in a Computer Engineering Consulting firm. I feel that any public knowledge of what i am about to relate could be damaging to my credibility, and wish to keep this account anonymous as far as the public is concerned. But, i also feel i must finally relate this account to an authoritative source whom may be able to quell my concerns. In retrospect, I finally identified the time lapse that took place. This concerns me more than anything, taking into account my current state of mind. I feel that this encounter, as long ago as it was, may have changed my life significantly without even recognizing it, until now. It was late summer, 1975. My parents used to let one of my three brothers and i stay up an hour later than the rest once a week. We were all within a few years in age. That night, I was not the one, and was sent to bed at seven-thirty. It was just before twilight. The sun sets later this time of year (of course). The way the bed faced, i could see outside through two large(4'x5') triple pane windows. I was almost asleep when something drew my attention outside. I opened my eyes to see what appeared to be a very large yellow-orange disk hovering above the trees. It was hard to say how far away it was. I stared at it. It made no noise, but again I was inside the house. The disk had two, relatively speaking, small bumps or turrets on the top and bottom. The sunset was beginning to turn the sky a pale red, pink color. The next thing i remember, it was pitch black outside. The disk degraded to a small round white light. At the time, i described it to my classmates as a 'headlight' (as in a car headlight). The headlight zipped away at tremendous speed, and was out of sight within seconds. What i have written here constitutes the majority of the actual experience. If this information is helpful and/or in line with current theory and phenomena, and you feel that additional information would help, i will leave my contact information. In addition to what i have written here, I feel that i have much more to add, but do not wish to waste your time with something that can only be invalid from an informed perspective. I have not disclosed this information to any other source. If i do not receive a reply i will assume that your judgement of the facts is such that this account could only be false, or merely 'all in my mind' as my brothers would say.

I am curious what is done with this type of information, especially since it is after the fact of the incident. My mother, a stable, religious, and previously non-believing (in UFOs) person, related the following story to me this evening: At approximately 7 p.m she was driving home and saw a straight line of intense white V-shaped lights in a perfectly straight line ahead, about 1000' in the sky.  She described them as looking light ""football stadium lights"" only v-shaped, that close together and straight.  She ended up driving 10 blocks until she was nearly underneath.  She slowed down the car and rolled down the window to observe and try to figure out what they were, and at that point the center object left the formation proceeding straight forward, and the remaining object followed, still in tight, straight formation, and all were quickly out of sight. The one thing she thought very odd was that there was no sound at all from the objects, unlike aircraft. She is not the type to embellish or fabricate such a story, and did not even feel anything more than a curious amusement about this topic, but now is shocked, certain of what she saw, and a believer that what she saw was not any craft that she has ever heard of.  She related this to me to ask if I knew of any military aircraft that was quiet and matched that description because I served with the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing and knew of most military aircraft in the world. This is quite a story, and has really shaken her belief system.  I think it is fascinating and was interested to see if there is any way to check on air traffic activity during that period of time.

Two objects seen up close. One hovered over our home, the other flew over at just above treetop level.  A third was seen in the distance as a red light falling from one of the craft to the ground. My husband, myself, and our 2 sons, ages 2yrs, and 1 year old were moving into our new house on March 17th, 1977.  I remember the date clearly because it was my younger sons 1 year old birthday.  I was in the house unpacking with my 1 year old, and my husband and older son were outside getting things from the truck.  It was dark by this time, but we had the porch lights on.  This was in the sante fe area of Denver, Colorado, which is a fairly heavily populated area of Denver. At approximately 7:30 pm, my husband came running into the house, and yelling my name.  He was very agitated, and nearly speechless,and he just kept saying my name while dragging me out to the back side of the house. I would say no more than 30 seconds had past between him racing into the home, and he and I going back outside.  When I got out there he began to tell me what had happened to him.  He said he was bending down in the cab of the truck to retrieve a box when it lit up like someone had placed a powerful flashlight over his shoulder.  He looked over his shoulder and saw a craft hovering, with no sound, right at treetop level over our home.  It had ice cube shaped lights on it, which were flashing in a circular movement around the object.  The craft itself was spherical in shape.  As soon as he saw it, he raced in the house to get me.  My 2 year old was left outside by himself, and he has no memory of the event. By the time I came outside, the object was in the distance, and it looked like a very large, bright star to me.  I had jumped up on the cab of the truck for a better look, and began to search the sky.  As I looked up and behind me, I saw another craft that was very low to the ground flying right over my head.  It was higher than treetop level, but not by much.  This craft was triangular, had 3 very large amber colored lights on the bottom of it.  It was close enough that I was able to make out some of the mechanical lines of the craft on its bottom part.  There was no sound at all, and it just drifted past.  I watched it until I could not make it out anymore. The other craft (the first one spotted) had now appeared to stop and hover over the far mountains.  It was blinking, and then appeared to change shape and color.  It went from white, to gold, to pale red, and changing shapes.  It was too far away to tell the exact shapes, but it did not stay spherical.  Then a round, very bright red light seemed to drop from it, and float to the ground, leaving a trail as it did. The main craft then turned bright white and circular again, and moved off toward Boulder, CO. We watched it until we couldn't make it out anymore. Approximately 3 to 5 minutes later, a number of helicopters and planes we suspected were military buzzed around our home.  They searched the area for about 5 minutes, then moved off. There were several cars that had stopped by our home, gotten out of their cars and watched the crafts as well.  We talked with them, but did not get their names.  I have never reported this incident until now.  The main reason I am, is to see if your organization got any other reportings of this event.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,39.74512637220715,-104.95934593826682

I stopped to see exactly what these things might be and encountered another couple who had also stopped for the same reason. We did not converse with each other. Since it was Decemeber 10th, it was quite cold and clear. I stood on the side of the road and observed the four lights/disks for some time. To the naked eye, they appeared slightly larger than the moon. They were motionless, hovering at what appeared to be approximately 1,500-2500 feet. A more precise calculation was impossible, since there was no way to gauge their true size. As I recall, some 21 years later, the four ""disks"" changed formation while I was observing them. Since I had been at the racetrack, I had my trusty binoculars along, a pair of 7x35 magnification. Looking thru my glasses, I could only discern one thing of any interest: these objects, whatever they were, had a colored lights on the outer edges of the diameter; the colors were different; one was red, the other blue. The interior of these disks had no definition whatsover. They just looked light some sort of self-illuminating disk. They did not seem to illuminate the ground below, as far as I could tell. The one thing that was curious to me was that they were overhead in the vicinity of a small, part-time radion station, WJUN, which is comprised of a small cement block building and a transmitter tower. I stood there silently watching this phenomenon for some 10-15 minutes and finally departed due to the inclement weather and lack of any appreciable ""activity"" from these objects, aside from their changing of formation. They were still overhead when I left. The following day, someone (the couple on the side of the road?) wrote to the local paper, The Lewistown Sentinel about this event. The nitwit at the paper responded that they were probably helicopters. Whatever these things were, they were NOT helicopters. There was no sound coming from these o! bjects. As a footnote to my experience, I noticed several weeks later in the Sunday paper supplement, Parade Magazine, that folks in Australia has sighted the EXACT same four objects down there! Coincidence? Maybe, but I doubt it. This is the first time I have recounted my 1978 experience for publication.

The object looked like a huge glowing ball but when I zoomed in on it you could see a huge sphere like object that was a light cream/grey color with symmetrical patterns on it. This instantly shocked us. You could not see the patterns with your naked eye or even with binoculers, as we tried, but using the zoom on the video camera (it's one of the latest model camera's with a great zoom) was totally amazing, you could see it very well. I kept filming the object and it would glow brightly (white) with green around the edges, then change to red around the edges, then the glowing would subside and the camera was able to pick up the sphere with the patterns on it again. The sphere also moved in and out on the camera screen getting larger and smaller as I stayed still on it. We don't know what it was, but were totally amazed by it!

I lay very still while witnessing the light move closer and what appeared in the doorway was a very bright, iluminated sphere. I can only characterize movement as being suspended, yet bobbing about in an almost fluid motion. It came close, then raced upward and directly shot out of the window. My husband witnessed this thing, but refuses to ever dicuss it. Even denies it took place. Went to bed after a normal workday and fell asleep. An hour or so later I awoke  and noticed a light coming from another room. I instantly was aware that it could not be a light inadvertantly left on as it had a distictive illuminating glow about it. For reasons unknown to myself, i instinctively had the impression that ""it was coming"". I lay completely still as this light became brighter as it moved closer to the bedroom door. In the doorway appeared an extremely bright illuminated spere. This thing had the color of something so bright that it was almost bluish. It remained bobbing in the doorway a short while, then moved directly over me, moved from over  my head to my feet staying up near the ceiling as it did so. It then moved directly over my abdomin and descended slowly until it was inches, I mean inches, from my stomach. It then bobbed there for thirty or forty seconds, then slowly rose to about two or three feet above me. I then realized my husband was sound asleep during all of this and tried to awaken him. I was being subtle as I was afraid that too much motion would disturb this bobbing orb above me. He finally awoke and I thought he was going to have a seizure. At the point of his gasping, this thing rose quickly raced out of the window. At this point we both jumped to the window to see where this thing went, but it was nowhere to be seen. My husband was completely shaken by this event and over time has decided it didn't happen. I, myself, have been timid about mentioning it to anyone because i do not wish to be percieved as some kind person needing psychiatric attention. I do so now because I have always been perplexed by this, but have never heard of anyone experiencing something like this.

My sisters and I saw an immense object hovering very close to our back yard. I remember this incident so vividly.  It was a clear, hot summer day around 5 or 6pm in Citrus Heights, when my sisters and I were socializing in our back yard.  I was 17 and my sisters 14 and 19.  Out of nowhere, a VERY LARGE saucer (50 ft or so)descended and was partially over our back yard--at the southeast corner approximately 70 feet away.  This saucer was a medium gray metallic color and had bright white lights that traveled in a circular motion around the perimeter--it was so immense and so close!  We couldn't see the top of the saucer because we were basically looking up at this object.  At first, we thought that it could be a military aircraft, but it was eerily silent, especially since it was stationary and hovering so close to us for some time.  Living in Sacramento for 16 years with four military airbases close by, I have seen every possible military aircraft that you can imagine--this was not an aircraft!  My sisters and I were hysterical while scrambling to get our polaroid camera; the picture  we attempted  to take came out blurred (strangely, it was still light outside and usually does not get dark until 8 or so during the summers in Sacramento).  We watched as the saucer slowly ascended and headed south.  Why am I reporting this story so late in life?  First, I didn't think anyone would believe me even though I have two sisters who could corroborate my story.  Second, there was a program on last night about UFOs (2/17/99) that compelled me to investigate after seeing an interview of an Ohio policeman who saw a saucer and described that it was so close but made no noise.  This was the first time I have heard a witness recount their experience which was somewhat similar to mine.  Finally, when a person experiences something of this magnitude, its disturbing; when there are so many people who have experienced this, but no real answers, it is extremely disconcerting.  I am not a ""spiritual"" person but a discerning individual who comprehends by facts. I felt the need to share my experiene in furthering the research of UFOs.  I want to know what I saw that day. My sisters and I are college educated, well read, successful and very normal people.  I am a vice president of a large high tech firm based out of Philadelphia and have been an executive in the high tech field since graduating from a university at the age of 21.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,38.693050422535215,-121.29238225352114

I have posted two other reports that happened in the summers before  the experiences described here. These happened in the mid to late 1980’s in Lost Park near Jefferson Colorado. We camped in the area for quite a few years on a regular basis. We moved our campsite to the Lost Park area from the Tarryall reservoir area. Lost park is about 10 miles or so from the reservoir. We found a road that went up and around to the top of a small hill and were camping there for 5 or 6 weekends in a row. The first time we saw them a friend of mine was looking at what we thought was a campfire on a ridge about 1\2 of a mile away with my telescope. The telescope was a 900 power at maximum magnification. As soon as he got the scope focused in on the campfire he said the fire went out! Then about a minute later the sphere that we thought was the fire went up in the sky! As we watched it in awe it went up and joined two other lights. The next several weekends as soon as it got dark there were three UFO’S in the same general place in the sky. They would move slowly around in the same area sometimes close to each other sometimes further apart. At times one of them would be down low enough to be below us from our vantage point. Their behavior was always the same every time we saw them (i.e.: slow and deliberate and random). They were bright red spheres and always three of them. This occurred for 5 or 6 weekends both Friday and Saturday nights, enough that we got tired of watching them. They were about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away (approx). We were crossing a forest service sign to go up to the hilltop. It was the kind they put right in the middle of the road and it was plastic so you could just drive over it and it would spring back up when it came out from under your vehicle. The last time we went there the forest service had put a permanent sign up that you couldn’t just drive over. So we moved our camp to where we thought we would be right under the objects but we never saw them again. I have camped in the area for years and never seen the three UFO’S again. These trips were usually at least 4 people sometimes more. Depending on who went as we went in a group of close friends. These reports are all old because we didn’t know who to report them to and we didn’t think the police or forest service would do anything about it or even believe us.

As soon as I became aware that the grass was blue and was puzzled about it, it suddenly switched to green.  It was then I realized I could move and I stood up and felt a presence behind me.  I turned and looked up above the trees and saw the large object.  It had approx a double row of 100 windows and was light brown metallic color.  It was moving slowly west.  I felt fear and turned to run into the house.  But then it dawned on me I had just been there and the ""people"" were friendly. I turned back, smiled and waved.  I stood there and watched the object move slowly west for about 3 minutes.  I then ran into the house and tried to communicate to my mother what I had just seen.  She went outside but the craft had already passed over and did not return.  She could not understand what I was trying to tell her.  She then asked if I wanted lunch (that is why I place the time around 11 AM). I remembered at the moment the ""people"" who looked like those whose picture was on the front of Communion though with less pointy chins as depicted on that cover.  I later recalled ""flashes"" or moments of actually being on the craft.  In junior high school I would draw/doodle pics of the large eyed, large headed persons.  It is difficult even now to think of them as aliens or anything other than persons or people.  It was a totally positive experience. Later, I was in Army Intelligence as Chief, Intelligence Branch, Military Intelligence Division, G2.  During the USS PUEBLO incident I participated in decisions about the use of nuclear weapons against North Korea (Jan68).  I experienced an intense Deja Vu and there was a sense of dread that ""the last time through"" we had made the wrong decision and used nukes vs NK.  I made recommendations not use them in a memo that had 5 items against and 3 items for their use. After the memo had b! een acce pted by, sent in CINC, UNC name unchanged, I experienced a recall of craft seen at 4 years old and the feeling that was why had the ""contact.""  That the purpose of that ""contact"" had been fulfilled with my recommending not using the nuke weapons but instead advocating for negotiations and setting an example for other countries to keep the peace.  The first point of the memo was the stated United Nations Command mission was to ""keep the peace."" The second point was negotiated to get the crew back unharmed and set an example for other countries to follow in such crises. I can recall the entire memo but it was classified: TOP SECRET, NOFORN, LIMDIS, EYES ONLY  on the rest of the items in the memo.  But there was the intense feeling that the purpose of the contact had been fulfilled with decision not to use nuclear weapons in response to the seizure of the USS PUEBLO.  I have only told a very few persons about this for obvious reasons.  But it is as clear to me today was it was then.  At the time my IQ was measured at 155 and I had a photographic memory with respect to reading intellligence reports.  The naming of the position I held as Chief, Intelligence Branch identifies me to those who have access to the information of who filled that position during the PUEBLO crisis.  I am a bit uncomfortable about that but the experience of 1949 is clear in my mind.  I have researched for sightings of such an object as I saw: cigar shaped with double row of windows and light brown metallic color and huge:  as a 4 year old I can only try to guess at the true size of the object.  But I estimate at least 500 yard long (in my mind 5 football fields) or larger.  At one point I found a list of sightings in a book which indicated a large cigar shaped object in summer of 1949 near South Bend, Indiana which is approx 30 miles from the New Troy, Michigan location.  It confirmed my experience.  I would be interested in knowing if there were any other sightings during 1949 of such a large object in the midwest.",,41.8764,-86.5497

Although I can't swear to the exact date now, I think I was about eight or nine years old at the time.  Therefore it must've been the late summer or early fall of 1964 or 1965.  I remember that my family and I had been sitting on the patio in our backyard and watching shooting stars because the skies were so clear.  Around eight o'clock in the evening everyone else went back inside to watch a television program.  I stayed outside to see a few more of the meteorites. At this point I should describe the physical location of our house and its surroundings at that time.  Our house was at that time approximately two miles north of the city limits of St. Marys, WV (it is now within the city's expanded limits) on Route 2 in a rather narrow section of the Ohio River valley.  From the perspective of our backyard patio, the Ohio River and the ridge of hills on the Ohio side of the river are on the left.  Almost immediately to the right is the ridge of hills on the West Virginia side.  And at that time the backyard faced a large cow pasture.  The barbed wire fence enclosing that pasture marked the boundary of our backyard and was perhaps 15-20 feet from the back of our house.  The owner of the pasture lived in a small white farmhouse a couple of hundred yards away to the north (up-river).  Beyond that, the only other structure visible was the smokestack of what was then the state home for mentally retarded children (the Colin-Anderson Center).  It was perhaps a half mile beyond the pasture.  The pasture itself had a small pond for the cattle to drink from with a large old tree just to the left of it (from our patio's point of view).  The pond was about 80 yards from the edge of the fence and our yard. Again, as I was waiting for more shooting stars, I was startled by a flash of light that lit up the pasture for an instant like the flash from a camera.  I saw what seemed to be a large, white object shoot across the valley from above the ridge on my right and downward (in a slight arc)until it disappeared from sight behind the ridge of hills on the Ohio side of the valley.  I remember that the object didn't shoot across the valley at a uniform speed or motion.  Rather, it seemed to lurch by in a somewhat jerky motion.  I thought there would be a sound of big crash but there was no sound.  I remember that I was a little scared and excited too.  Just as I was thinking of running into the house and telling everyone what I had just seen, I was frozen into my chair by what happened next.  Suddenly, from above the ridge on the Ohio side of the river, a white disc shaped thing popped up and zipped (in an erratic, lurching movement) across the river and came to an unsteady stop (it didn't completely stop moving but seemed to keep inching forward slightly in little jerky movements as if it were a boat trying to maintain its position in a slight current) right in front of my eyes just above the top of the large tree beside the farm pond.  I think I was so frightened that I couldn't move.  It just floated there in the air, inching forward in little jerks, until it was above the pond.  There was no sound whatsoever.  The object appeared to be white or silvery but it didn't illuminate the ground.  Also, as it slowed, it's brightness dimmed to a hazy gray color.  I think I may have ran towards it for some reason but I can't remember now.  At any rate, after what seemed only a few seconds, I recall seeing the object zip away to the north (up the valley)in an instant.  Again, its motion was lurching and rather zig-zaggy as it climbed away into the sky.  I remember it looked rather like a fat, white star as it became smaller and smaller. Also, I was left with the impression that it looked rather liquid and formless (like a white globule of some sort)as it zigged into the stars and appeared to disappear among them.  After I came back to my senses, I remember that I became very excited and dashed back into the house and told everyone that I'd seen a big white thing zipping around outside.  Nobody bothered to come outside.  My mother still remembers my bursting into the house all excited about something way back then. The most troubling thing, however, is my recollection of an inexplicable feeling of dread and forboding should I ever talk about it.  That feeling lasted for several years.  I suppose that this event is too attenuated in time to be of much interest to anyone.  Nevertheless, I think I'll feel better by letting someone know what I saw (as incredible as it sounds).",,39.366,-81.193

On 10/31/89, I observed an anomalous object in the fully dark night sky above El Jebel, Colorado (Eagle Cnty.). My family and I had just stepped out of our car after parking at the curb in a residential area that we intended to canvas for the purpose of trick-or-treating. It was fully dark, and a completely clear evening with no clouds. As my wife was getting our two boys' costumes in order, I looked up into the night sky. Immediately, I observed what appeared to be a moving area of the night sky directly above me, through which the stars were totally obscured. I could not estimate the shape or size of whatever caused this phenomenon. There was no sound. There were no lights that seemed to be associated with the cause of the hidden stars. The only suggestion of the object's shape and altitude was that the bottom of the object appeared to be convex because I could see groundlight from the homes around us reflected from its surface. There were no lights in the neighborhood brighter than a streetlight or a porchlight. Therefore, I surmised that a dark object must be fairly low in altitude to reflect dim lights in such a manner. It moved steadily, and if at low-altitude, slowly from the NE to the SW (generally in a line from El Jebel, CO towards Mt. Sopris, a 12,900 foot mountain that serves as a handy landmark for residents of the Valley). The sighting lasted for approximately 5 seconds. Although I pointed and yelled, ""Look!"" no other member of my family saw the object. Observer background: 37-year-old male. B.A. in Anthropology. At the time of the sighting I was a part-time real estate salesperson. My vision is good with eyeglass correction, and my hearing is normal. I was familiar with the neighborhood in which the sighting ocurred as I had lived there for a period of 6 months two years earlier. I revisited the exact spot in the daylight to determine if there were any overhead powerlines that might account for my impressions, but there were none. I had never seen anything like this before that time, and I have not seen anything like it since. I did not report the sighting because I regarded myself as a ""bad witness.""

I lived at mom's house then and my bed was situated such that my head was directly below the window.  The window had one of the first model of storm windows that were marketed about 20 years ago which I think is significant because it was partly responsible for waking me up at I don't know what time but it had to be between 1:30 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. I woke up because the window was vibrating and I heard a sound coming from somewhere.  I gathered my senses enough to really wonder what the hell that low humming sound was, I for a second thought it was a semi tractor trailor idling out in the street of our neighborhood, but I knew the sound could not be that.  So I sit up to look out the window and can't really see anything, but I know that from whatever the sound is coming it is close by.  So I stand up and feel kind of like I'm hazy-sleepy, like when you fight getting out of bed in the morning, stand up and feel kind of a head rush, sort of.  But I AM very aware at this point, just going against some resistance.  I walk out onto the deck behind our house that is directly attached to my room.  I look left, down the street, to the house where the Mort family used to live before the people that live there when this event occurred.  I can't remember their names now, Lothman maybe, but they had two little children and we practically never saw them in the several years they lived there.  It is a good sized house about 250 yards down the street, sitting up on a hill, a three story house that really sticks up from where it sits.  Above that house, I saw it instantly, was the space ship.  It was saucer shaped I guess, but not pointy.  Shit wish I could draw it for you.  Since I can't...it was fucking big, but not too big.  The house I'm guessing is 60-70 feet wide looking at it from the front which I was, and the ship was at least 50 feet wider, and I'm guessing about 30-40 feet thick.  It looked like a fat saucer, like you take a rubber ball, the size of a tennis ball, and squeeze it by pressing it on a table untill it is 3 to 4 times longer than wide, but with a slight bevel leading up to the center consol on top.  The top and bottom were distinct.  It was hovering about 20 feet directly their house.  It was definitely using caution because it had all its lights off except for a row or two that were very dimmed, all the way around, plus up at the Cabin I gues! s for lack of any better word.  I could not see it doing anything.  I did know that the sound was coming from the ship.  And when I stood there staring at it for about 1.5 minutes I could really tune in the sound and feel it stronger now that I realized it was really there.  What I felt was that it was very low frequency, and it had an almost intoxicating effect on me.  I thought that this is what they are using as method to ensure that everyone in the neighborhood remains sleeping.  Especially since it was actually quite a soothing feeling, such that I now realize that I was just standing there staring at this thing for 3 or 5 minutes just amazed and nothing else.  Then I realized that they knew I was looking at them.  And I remember thinking to myself and to them, ""I don't care what you're doing here, just please don't do anything to me.""  Then the craft raised up silently above the house about 100 feet, then it just took off like you would expect from an advanced ufo.  So fast that it just left a streak.  When it left on two vectors.  First to the right slightly, up and away for about an inch of streak, then back slightly to the left and straight away at an upward angle out of the atmosphere I imagine leaving a big streak. I have no other evidence than this story.  I would certainly like to investigate that family who lived in the house the ufo was over.  This is the only written version of this event, although I have told a handful of people over the years since it happened.  You can call me for a drawing if you want.  I'm no artist but I can try.  Thanks for your interest.  Let me know if this experience is worth anything, I would appreciate the kickback.  But don't get me wrong I am honest to God writing this as it happened to me, and its certainly not for any other motivation other than to present the story to someone who will actually find it yet another piece of evidence to support that there really are ufos.  I guess I have to believe there are.  I just hope to God there is never an Independence Day.  Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

The triangle continued to follow the tracks and we watched until it was out of sight and the scouts were gone as well. The mothership was immense!  Noiseless!  Moved at a slow rate of speed.  It did not move erratically, just continued on a straight path over the local train station tracks. The red lights at the corners and along the edges were very bright.  The 6 scout ships were of a bright white color that remained solid as they flew at a speed of a Cessna airplane.  They flew over the farmfields in that area as if they were scanning something.  When they came out of the mothership, they would appear as one bright white light splitting into two separate crafts.  Concerning the 3rd light to come out of the mothership:The other 4 scouts were already moving along the skyline of the fields.  The 3rd light came out, grew intensly bright white (whiter than white)then immediately flew back in to the craft.  We watched this happen at about 1000ft above our heads.  We had to look directly straight above us.  It then came out again, almost immediately, grew intensly bright white and split into 2 crafts.

As I was turning into my driveway I noticed 2 bright lights over the field a couple of hundred yards away, at first I thought it was a low flying airplane, but as I watched I realized it was much to close and low to be an airplane, also there was no sound. I walked down to the end of the driveway, as I stood there the lights started coming closer, very slowly the object came towards me until it hovered motionless about 100 feet directly above me. I would approximate it to be about 100 feet long, not quite as wide as it was long, I suppose ""cigar"" shape would be close. The underside was very black, it was difficult to make out the outline, there was a deep red light off center on the underside, and bluish-white lights shining outward from each end and the sides. There was a low pitch humming like sound, no down draft that I could feel coming from it. As I looked around and realized there was no one else around, a panic came on me, I ran up the driveway and crouched down behind my car, (this seems almost funny to me now) as I looked back at the craft it began to move slowly off down the road. I ran back down the driveway to see where it was going, it stopped and hovered just above the tree tops about 60 yards away, it slowly rotated and made a high mechanical whining noise, it's difficult to describe because I have never heard anything like it. It then began to move off towards the main road. Where I got the nerve, I'll never know, but I got in the car and headed after it. When I reached the main road the craft was just on the other side of the street, right at tree top level, I got out of the car and stood on the hood of it and just starred at this thing, it was close enough that I could have hit it with a rock. From this angle I could see three lights blinking along the craft, one green, red, and a blue one, also a row of dim lit lights that looked to be windows. As I stood there for about a minute it began to slowly move away along t! he road heading south, I followed along at about 60 mph as this craft flew along just above the trees along side of the road, after about a mile I lost sight of it. Three miles from home I pulled into  the parking lot of a closed store and got out to look out aver a big valley, as I stood there it came out across the valley in a big arc and went out of sight. At this point I was very wound up and excited so I headed home to call some one about this. As I was driving home, I saw it again in the rear view mirror, I stopped and got out of the car and watched it again fly off out of sight. After I got home and was getting out of the car it came over the tree line at a fair distance away and flew off out of sight. I sat out on the deck for about an hour but did not see it again that night. The time from when I first saw it until I got home was about 45 minutes. A strange thing was that while this was going on there where no cars on the road, after it was over the were quite a few. I made several phone calls over the next several days, but no one could tell me anything, some people laughed, the was some ridicule from others, and some people said they believed and a few even shared sighting of there own. In closing I'd just like to say that this is absolutely a true story and the strangest thing that I have ever experienced, it seemed as if this craft were playing some cat and mouse game with me.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,,

My husband was out in the back yard of our country home,  (about 8 acres) to take care of the dogs in the kennel.  He was shining an ordinary flash light toward the stars on a clear night.  Time was about 11pm.  The sky was very clear and dark, no lights from the cities.  He had been outside for about 15 minutes when he called me to come and look at this funny star.  I came out and he pointed at a star that seemed to be moving at right angles-the distance from us was hard to tell--but it was only the size and brightness of a star in the distant sky..  He was turning the flash light on and off, and when the light was on the object begain to move closer (could tell because it grew larger and brighter--as though it were homing in on our little light)  When he turned the light off it retreated back to it's orignial size and place in the distant sky.  At the time we were certain it was not a star because of the movement, and the angles of the turns and speed of which it grew closer, and withdrew, it was doubtful that it was a plane.  My husband kept playing with the light, moving the light, and shining the light toward the object, (which looked still star like) and the object got larger and brighter as it came toward us.  In a very short time (seconds) it seemed to travel a great distance to stop over our yard and hover there.  The light was so bright that we saw our shadows in the darkness and the whole field was lit up like a carbon arc light.  By this time I was frightened because we didn't know what it was, or who it was, but it was certain it was nothing like anything known.  There was no sound at all, only this intense light, which shone so bright, that it was impossible to tell the shape, or see the craft itself...however it was directly over us.. impossible to tell how close or the size. We could only see the light and here no sound.  We ducked down behind the bushes, which was a joke, because they didn't hide us at all, and I urged my husband to turn the light off...he did and the object/light withdrew from us and grew smaller and smaller until it was the same star-like ofject we had seen before.  My husband turned the light on again and shined toward the ""star"" and once again it zoomed toward us and grew into this brilliant light overhead.  Once more he turned the light off and it zoomed away...off into the distant horizon.  We went into the house, and turned off the lights....locking the doors..I called my mother to report on what had just happened.  A few days later there was an article in the Lorain Journal or the Sandusky Register paper, about 2 nurses who were leaving work and chased by a ufo on their route home.  This was on the same night!  The direction they were coming from would have been in the same direction this light came from.  The milage from there to where we were would have been about 34-45 miles, and if it was from the Cleveland Ohio area the distance from us was about 65-80 miles...if I remember correctly. So it traveled a long distance to reach us in seconds...and also what is interesting to take note of, is that what kind of technology would it have to have to spy our flashlight at such a distance...and be able to zero in on it's location, and be there in seconds....so we were open to the idea that maybe it was not from somewhere else but maybe some unknown craft of ours.  My husband had a mathmatics degree and was a scientific person. so this is why he kept playing with the light to see what would happen, and before the experience was not a believer in ufos.  Prior to this event some weeks before this I had been alone at home and spotted hovering glowing objects over the woods late at night.  The area where we lived was within a mile of a proposed neclear powerplant to be built by Ohio Edison.  They purchased land without telling the truth to the people who sold to them.  They thought it was going to be a resort.  Later the truth came out.  There was great oposition to it.The lights that I had seen were hovering over that area. One note of interest.  This experience had an impact on me, and I have always saught an explaination...a few years or so after this event, I started having out of body experiences...once, for some reason I became really still during one of these experiences and asked with my thoughts, about the ufo experiences....and a voice answered me saying, ""They are real, they are related to us in that all energy is related, and, were in the area to influence the population who lived there, to protest the building of the neclear power plant.""  Believe this or not, there was enough protesting and the plant was never built on this property.",1999-10-02T00:00:00,41.3244,-82.4755

We called every organization we could think of and no one else reported anything and they tried to suggest that it was from Disney land?? It was not from there, it was in space cutting across our atmosphere.  It was there at about 8:35pm or 9:35pm four about an hour. After awhile above us there were 4 or 5 giant orange flashes, no sound. Our conclusion after some more investigation; The space shuttle just happened to be in orbit at these times and the above occurred for about 3 day's after our initial sighting.  The flashes however were only seen by us that first night. This happened almost 10 years ago and we are reasonably sure that it was some test by the government in our space shuttle program. I heard you on Artbell and decided to get this off my chest since you sounded sincere in trying to collect data on sightings of various events. It was a laser beam tested 10 years ago. No doubt in our minds. What it shot at? What were the large orange flashes? Somebody knows but not us.  Thanks for letting me post this in your database.

It did'nt seem to have any markings or openings.

At approx. 7:30 PM we saw what looked like a plane or a rocket taking off or flying slightly up and souhtbound in the sky directly ahead. It had a large orange tail. It got to a cretain height and then stopped cold. It then moved across the sky parallel to the horizon very fast and covered a lot of sky quickly. It stopped again, sat there for a minute, then it moved downward, tail reappearing and swirling around it like a fishhook. It then disappeared. We could make out no characteristics of the object except that it was as bright as a star and the sun had set behind it in the sky.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,33.73288061674009,-116.22243788546257

It was the color of a green glow stick, seemed to have a slight trail, and was followed by two flanking objects, same color, but much smaller, which traveled at the same speed. The trailing objects were about a thumb at arms length back from the main object, with the appearant size each of the planet Venus. They gave the impression of being debris from the main object. They trasversed about 40 degrees of sky, as visible through a large sky light, in less than two seconds. The impression was of a rapidly falling object. The fire ball itself seemed fairly solid, only green flame like fuzziness at the very edges of the object made fireball the best description. There was the slight trail, very small, but no pronounced smoke trail that would be expected from a meteor. Except for the size and lack of smoke, seemed possible it was a meteor.

I am an associate editor at FATE magazine, and was investigating a report of a recurring UFO sighting in Baraboo. I met the witness, a Baraboo resident, on both March 31 and April 5, and we had sightings on both mornings, which were shared by one friend of mine on March 31 and two different friends on April 5. I will enter data on the more interesting April 5 incident in a separate posting to come. I have written about my experience in the forthcoming June issue of FATE, but wanted to place the information here since I am not getting a response from members of Wisconsin MUFON after three weeks since contacting them. This is apparently a _recurring_ incident. At 4:45 a.m. CST on March 31, I met the witness. I was training my binoculars on the southeastern horizon (an area known as the Baraboo Bluffs, in the vicinity of several radio and microwave towers) when I saw a orange-yellowish light soar a few degrees across the horizon. My friend, viewing with the naked eye, said she saw it zig-zag. I had the impression of an old-fashioned orange computer cursor that leaves a trail as it glides across a blank screen. It was bright, anomalous, very short-lived, and not easy to explain. We then runined any further opportunity to observe the light by driving off in the wrong direction, after which it was too bright and too foggy for us to see anything more. We concluded that the sighting may have been a UFO or other kind of anomalous ground-light activity. I returned to Baraboo on April 5 with two other friends. We discovered then that at least part of what our witness was describing, observing, and photographing was nothing more than good old planet Venus, in the southeastern sky. Disappointed, we waited around for a few hours and prepared to leave. But once again, while I was training my binoculars high in the southern sky on Venus (at 8:10 a.m. CDT), my friends and I had another strange sighting. This time, a bright white light seemed to emerge from behind the center of a thin cloud, a few degrees ""below"" Venus. It was tens of thousands of feet high. It ""swooped"" below the cloud (from our perspective) and seemed to leave a bright light impression or reflection before vanishing. I had the impression of the shape of a powerfully lit electric moth. Again, this was seen by myself, two friends, and the Baraboo witness. The whole thing seemed to resemble an extremely odd entrail from a plane, and I have not been able to look into this yet, but (1) we saw no physical craft, and (2) we agreed that it motion was far too anomalous, especially since it was 8 a.m. on a Sunday, and supposedly recurring. I believe there is some basis in truth for what the Baraboo witness has been reporting, but fact and fallacy have been difficult to separate. The Baraboo witness may report his extensive sightings soon by phone, but I personally can offer these two reports which were shared by a number of my friends, and seem to be consistent with most of the witness's claims. Since this is apparently a recurring event, I personally recommend that somebody with more resources investigates. I am available for more information.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,43.4807,-89.7399

That night I couldn't make it so I took to looking at the night skies from my house which is in vega alta two towns away from the laungh site. that's when I began to see some activity in the sky, soon after the first NASA laungh an object started moving about in the sky.  I saw it from a distance for a very long time, but for a minute or two it came extremely close. seconds after it took of never to be seen that night but as NASA'S project continiud more sightings apeared. I believe that what NASA was doing was distracting the public so that some other government agency would have the chance to perform their testing of a program in fact something was happening on the opposit side of the Island in lajas this is a town on the southwest side. After watching NASA have a rocket failier on almost every one of this, I began wondering NASA CAN'T be so disorganize. That's when I personally saw a lot of activity on the sorounding area of the laguna cartagena, many different government and military vehicles sighted there all thru the same time NASA was launghing rockets. Look I spent some time in the military with top secret clearence and I know something enough to understand that something is going on. Soon after roswell was hit by the media that's when plenty of night activity in the skies began hapening more government personel were being seen and on US military bases housing construction for more military personel is taking place at this very moment. Since I'm retired I often have time to look around and their are more unidentified agency working on sites that are of limits to civilians the same ones that used to be tourist sites, like the small Island near PR called vieques this is next to the bigest naval base of the USA. Somehow the government has take! n almost the entire Island {vieques}they say is for target practice. This is one of the most beautiful places in the word.

At this point, he summoned his wife, who also saw the object as it passed directly overhead.  they both agreed it was less that 500 feet above them.  It was not a helicopter, and it was too slow for an aircraft.  The two lights were on the bottom, and they were glowing.  They could see an outline of the object as it passed overhead, and it appeared to be ""pie-shaped.""  They both heard a really low hum as the object passed overhead very slowly.  The object suddenly disappeared approximately 2 seconds after it had passed overhead.   The caller added that he and his wife have three cats, one of which is an ""outside"" cat, and two that are ""indoor"" cats.  After the incident, all of the them were gone, and they did not return until approximately one week later.  Their dog, which normally is very eager to go outside, would not go outside for several days without coaxing from his owner.  The dog, a pit bull (?) was apparently very upset for several days afterward.  At 2315 hrs. that night, after the sighting, the dog started barking and snapping at the front door, and he would not go through that door for 4-5 days.",1999-11-02T00:00:00,27.076209523809524,-82.22327976190476

As I did I saw three objects moving very fast over head. At which point I immediately said, ""Those are UFO's!"" On the night of July 12, 1993, at 11:30PM, myself and two friends left my house in downtown Niagara Falls to travel by foot approximately 6 blocks in a northerly direction. While transiting between two fairly large buildings (4-8 stories) and traveling through a gravel parking lot single file, my first friend turned to my second friend, who was also second in line and said something, all while keeping pace and in step. After about one more step, my second friend, the one second in line, turned to me and said to ""look up"", at which point I did. I immediately said, ""THOSE ARE UFO'S!.""  I have been involved since my teenage years with aircraft. I used to wash airplanes for rides at the local airport. I've had the opportunity to fly in just about any and every type of aircraft imaginable, from hot air balloons over Niagara Falls to flying sailplanes around Pike's Peak. I have flown in acrobatic biplanes, helicopters and in general I am familiar with most modern and historic aircraft and their flight capabilities. What I and my friends saw at the time of the incident was unlike anything I/we had ever witnessed conventional aircraft do. Both friends have at least some form of familiarity with aircraft simular to my own. When I looked overhead, what I saw was three objects traveling in a northerly heading, from S.W. to N.E. at a relatively high altitude. 5,000 feet + and very fast speed. The speed was very fast for the altitude, as aircraft appear to the eye to move more slowly, the higher the altitude. There was no sound, either direct to ground or doppler effect. The three lights (at the aft portion of craft, as they traveled away) appeared to be a singular circular white glow, with a pink tinge encirling the circle of white light. As we were watching the three lights speed across the night sky, the object on the left, #1, broke off to the left, or west, at about 20 degrees from the other two. Just prior to this break-off, the other two craft, #2 and #3, oscillated in and out in a sort of ""bump"" manueavor. It was at that point that the #1 craft changed course and started to vere left and upward into the sky. All three objects then began to race upward and outward away from the earth and disappear with one craft on the right, #3 remaining for a moment longer and then too disappeared upward and away from the earth. The two aerodynamic annomalies that struck all of us were the craft's ability to rapidly move side to side and their upward arc away from the earth, as opposed to following the earth contour, horizon to horizon, as you would expect ""normal"" aircraft to do. Duration of the incident was about 20-30 seconds.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,43.106133918128656,-78.98603684210525

In 1994 I was coming home from my job as a registered nurse.  I was driving on Idaho highway #3/12 near what is known as the Arrow Junction. I noticed lights about 1/2 mile ahead of me that appeared to be stationary and located on the side of the river valley.  The night was very overcast with no stars or moonlight visible.  I thought for a moment that someone must have installed new lighting on the outside of their house because there are many new homes in that area.  As I approached the bridge, however, I saw that the lights were moving down the river towards me.  The lights turned into a triangular shaped aircraft that was probably about 150-200 feet above the river's surface.  It was moving very slowly downriver, over the center of the water.  I assume that the craft was triangular because the lights that were shining down were in a triangular pattern like this: 0 <--""front"" of craft Lights--->   0 0 0 0 0  <--rotating beacons between these lights I think that there were only 5 lights on the craft, but I don't remember for sure.  There were two rotating beacons in between the last three lights.  This struck me as odd because most aircraft marker lights that I'm aware of nowdays are strobe-type lights.  Another odd thing was that this really large aircraft seemed to be proceeding at a terribly slow rate of speed.  It seems to me that it must have had to have been a helicopter because the forward speed was so slow.  The lights were all white, even the rotating lights.  Since the sky was overcast and totally dark, I couldn't make out the actual form of the craft.  I always said that if I ever saw a ""UFO"" I would stop, get out, and watch it.  But this was so different than anything I've ever seen before that I could not bring myself to stop and get out of my rig.  I do not have an estimate of the physical size of the craft although it was very big.  I used to be a paratrooper and was in Viet Nam so I am familiar with a lot of the military's aircraft and I can say that I haven't a clue as to what this thing was, other than it was big and slow.  The second witness referred to above was another nurse who was driving her car ahead of mine.  The Arrow Bridge is at the intersection that we both took to get home and when I talked to her the next evening at work she said she saw the aircraft and that it appeared to be hovering directly over the bridge when she turned to get on the highway that would take her home.  This correlates with what I saw because I could see her car ahead of mine, turning on the bridge about 1/2-3/4 mile ahead of me and the lights at that time were directly over the bridge and appeared to be stationary.  She had no other information to add about what the thing looked like.  The aircraft passed by me and I continued to the bridge, then made the same turn that the other nurse made and continued home. Additional: The lights had the same brilliance and color of airplane landing lights.  I don't remember any other unusual factors about the lights other than that they were very white and very bright.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,46.173075000000004,-116.92227115384615

It appeared to be similar to a ""shooting star"" with a bright, white head and an orange firey tale.  It traveled across the sky in a straight direction until it was out of sight. This evening while barbequeing in the backyard, I was on my 2nd story deck facing westward when I looked up and noticed an orange tail behind an object traveling at a fairly high rate of speed.(faster than a commercial jet) I stood there for a few seconds watching this thing heading towards the sunset. It reminded me of a high-flying jet with a vapor trail, except this trail stayed the same length as it traveled. The 'head' of the object looked like a very bright whitish color, kind of flashy while it was close, then only the bright orange tail was visible as it moved further away. It seemed to be turning gently more westward as it moved further away.  I would say it took maybe 4-6 minutes before it was completely out of sight, which I am guessing over the Olympic Mountains. My brother saw it through his binoculars and his best guess was that of a piece of space junk re-entering the atmosphere at a very shallow pitch. Or a metoer. He said he thought there might be a 'chaser' plane, too. He said it was hard to tell because the trees were in the way.
