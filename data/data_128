I would guess this was flying over leander from where I saw it.  It made absolutely no noise and was incredibly camouflaged in the night sky.  There was no light emitting from the craft, the only reason I could see the craft was because of the silhouetting of the light from the stars in the night sky.

Object was observed at 49* NE from this location at an elevation of about 20* above horizon.  No clouds, clear night with many bright stars. (*) means degrees. At about 10:00pm, I stepped out my back door.  With the naked eye, I observed what I thought was an aircraft practicing stalls at night.  Being a former glider pilot and life long aviation enthusiast, I am familiar with aircraft at night.  I also have a steady stream of aircraft overhead leaving JFK and heading across in the Atlantic flight corridor.  I could see red, green/blue and white lights and thought these to be the port/starboard/landing lights of an aircraft.  The lights were clustered together and blinking rapidly. Imagine those colored LEDs blinking quickly on a wreath but this was in the shape of a tight ball.  As I continued to watch the lights slowly swoop up and down through a space of 1.0 to 1.5 degrees of sky, (using fingers,) I realized that the lights were wrong for an aircraft.  I observed perhaps 8-12 swoops.  Each swoop was in a slightly different direction in the sky, some to the left, others to the right.  Each swoop was a duration of 4-5 one thousand from top! to bottom.  I had excellent reference for elevation changes as the event occurred between two stationary trees with horizontal branches.  After observing for perhaps 10 minutes or more, I went in and grabbed my binoculars (Bushnell 16x50) and returned outside. I moved my observation position 4 feet right to gain a clear, unobstructed view without branches but still between two trees on either side of the object.  Standing and observing hand held was shaky so I kneeled down behind an Adirondack chair to steady the image. I could now see much more clearly the small cluster of multiple colored lights. My focal setting was not set to infinity. Thinking the different colors could be a refraction of white light in the lenses, I moved and observed stars and they were distinctly a single, steady source of white light compared to the colored lights of the object. I thought to try and photograph the object with my smart phone but shooting stars at night with the phone is pointless.  As I continued to observe the object through the binoculars, the swooping had noticeably slowed and diminished. I also noticed the cluster seemed smaller than when I first started, as if it was moving away but still remained in the same altitude position relative to the trees.  As I had been observing the object for about 10-15 minutes, my knees were sore from kneeling on the stone pavers. I left the object, still visible with naked eye but smaller in the sky and went to bed wondering what the ‘ell I just saw….",2019-10-04T00:00:00,41.3158,-73.1354

It's a place where people would hang out, since Dover had no place for young people to hang out at.  I have been skeptical for so many years because there is an Air Base really close to where this happened to, so I felt it was something base-related.   It was a triangular craft, had 3 lights, NO flashing lights at all.  The lights were arranged in a triangular pattern on the bottom of the craft.  Each edge of the triangle was semi-curved. It made NO noise at all.  Sitting in the vehicle, we watched this craft appear at seemingly nowhere high in the sky then lower itself.  We watched this craft move in directions that no aircraft could do - it would move West, then suddenly move Northeast after a few seconds, then head Southeast, then Northwest, and it suddenly went Southeast and traveled a little distance then went straight down behind the treeline. This transpired in about 1 minute.  This happened maybe 5 miles from the air base.  We could see residual light from the 3 white lights on the underneath portion of the triangular object at the ground from the area.

I was serving in the U.S. Navy at the time, working as a radar operator on P-3 Orion aircraft. My unit was deployed Mediterranean, operating from the naval air base in Sigonella, Italy.  Late one night, my crew took off on a tactical mission around midnight, heading east over the Mediterranean Sea.  Since it was a late departure and we had about 2 or 3 hours before arriving at our tactical area in the Eastern Med, most of the crew used the opportunity to catch a few hours of sleep.  Except of course, the cockpit crew and myself, as I nodded on and off while manning at the radar station. About hour after takeoff, the cockpit crew called back to me, and asked me perform a radar sweep of the area ahead.  They said they were seeing a strange, undefined ball of light off the nose, somewhere in the distance, that appeared it might be moving towards us.  The pilots said they could not make out any details, only that it was too big to be any star, moon, or planet, and it was moving independently of the background sky.   The pilots contacted the ATC controllers, asking if they had any other reported aircraft in our area, they replied that we were the only known aircraft flying over the eastern Med that night. I performed both radar and IFF sweeps of the area using onboard sensors, turning up nothing as well. After the radar sweeps came nil, I powered up the aircraft’s forward-looking infrared camera, and this time I was able to see the object, it was just as the pilots were describing, a large, undefined, ball of light.  Unfortunately, the IR camera onboard this aircraft was of an older generation, meaning the IR picture wasn’t much better than that of old black and white TV. After fiddling with IR camera not able to resolve any definable image of the object, I decided to go up to the flight station to see the object for myself.  It was as they described, a round, undefined, slightly yellow/orange ball of light.  It was directly off the nose in the distance and appeared to be either tracking us, or moving toward us as it was getting bigger.  I could not tell exactly how close it got, but after further closing in on us, it gently moved off to the left side of the aircraft, where it appeared to briefly parallel our course, and then it disappeared to the south, headed in a direction over the north coast of Africa, and disappearing off the horizon. Of the 14 or 15 folks we had on board that night, only 4 or 5 of us were awake to witness the unexplained event.  We all agreed that we had seen something of an unknown origin, but none of us thought much of it, and only causally mentioned it to the rest of the crew later.

I was in a Target parking lot at Crossroads Shopping Center in Cary, NC.  It was night time, the store was busy, and there were many people going both in and out of the store. I was walking toward my car when I felt a sense of being watched.  As one does, you instinctively look in the direction from where the feeling is coming. I looked up. There in the night sky, hovering, was a bright green craft.  It was lozenge-shaped to me.  I looked for a more exact shape name, and the closest shape description is a trigonal rhombohedral structure.  It was longer than it was high, like at least a 4:1 proportion. There is a crystal structure like that, I think for Mica or something.  That’s interesting because the color seemed sort of jewel-like & crystalline.  The color was bright enough that it was like an LED intensity, almost as if it was glowing.  This is the color green that you see when light splits from a prism. Anyway, as soon as I looked up, I got a distinct, unsettling sense that whatever/whoever was watching found my notice funny, as if they were mischievous and had been ""caught.""  The humor of it to them--I could feel that there was more than one--was relatable enough that I didn’t feel frightened, though this was extraordinarily strange.  Maybe I was so amazed I couldn't feel anything else. The craft then suddenly left.  There was no acceleration.  It was just at speed like instantaneously.  It was so fast that it was almost as if it had jumped.  The color intensity was bright enough that it briefly left a bit of a retinal imprint in my eyes.  It was as clear and bright as any of the parking lot lights, but more vivid, and with no light shining out like a street light has.  Just a beautiful bright green, incongruous and impossibly hovering in the sky, before suddenly leaving.  Zooming, streaking --any such verbs for rapid movement -- they don't come even close to describing the movement of the thing.  There's no existing word for what that craft did. I looked around and no one else that I could see was looking up as if they had noticed, too.  That also was bizarre and confusing. I have no way to estimate how big it was because I can't tell how high in the air it was.  It was relatively low to the ground because it wasn’t tiny the way jets look when they're well along in their flight at altitude.  If I had to guess, I’d say it was flying about the height a helicopter flies.  I might be thinking that, though, because the thing seemed to be somewhat longer than the length of a helicopter.  Again, this isn’t actually reliable; I'm just guesstimating.  When I looked up, though, I raised my head at an angle of over 45 degrees.  Hopefully, that might help someone get some rough idea of the thing's height in the sky. I was a middle-aged college graduate at the time.  I studied a lot of geophysics in college, though that didn't end up as my degree.  Though I had never ruled out alien life, I never believed that alien life, especially advanced life, would be here.  Yet, I cannot believe what I saw was some military craft. How could it be?  Though humans can feel themselves being watched, the clear sense of humor I felt coming at me— recognizing my notice, as if we were exchanging an actual glance and I could clearly ""read"" them — that doesn’t seem like something any human can manage, especially from such a remote sky position.  Yes, the humor and mischievousness felt human in that those are recognizable human emotions triggered by the relatable circumstance of being ""caught"", but there was also a sense behind all that of a certain sophistication.  Not patronizing exactly, but I was definitely ""other"" and not in on the secret as it were.  It seemed to ""like""! people. It has been almost 20 years and it is still so clear to me.  My bafflement left me unable to even have a huge emotional reaction. I can barely process what happened now. I’m still baffled. I don't know how to digest what happened, especially feeling their reaction to me seeing the craft, that sense that we ""saw"" one another. How did no one else seem to see them?  Why were they looking at me so much in particular that it caused me to look up? What were they doing hovering above a Target parking lot of all places?  How could they feel so relatable?  Why did it make no sound?  I so wish I had answers. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2019-06-27T00:00:00,35.78376197916666,-78.80133489583334

I walked to the back door and something told me to look up, I saw 7 red orbs following each other.  Yes, this is Abq and hot air balloons are rampant but these were not balloons as it was around 2100 hrs.  The mountains are to my east and these red orbs were in southern direction.  The 7th and 6th orb simply faded out.  Orb #5 shot up into the sky to a much higher elevation.  Number 4 thru 1 were still in a southern direction but began to veer southeast.  All of the orbs seemed to be slow moving when from the west came two F-15s.  I could tell they were as their dual afterburners were blowing trying to play catch up.  These two 15s WERE NOT FROM KIRTLAND (as KAFB only had F-16s (single engine afterburners)). ! Number 4 disappeared, #3 turned south and shot faster.  These two F-15s were now following the last two remaining orbs and never caught up.  The remaining two orbs (#2 and #1) just a continuous exact same distance from the 15s.  I immediately went in and switched on the TV to see anything was being reported.  Nothing ever came up in the news.  Our birds (helicopters and fixed wing acft) never flew in a southeastern direction to include commercial acft.  Those two jets were scrambled from another base to catch these orbs as my sister unit (F-16 ""Tacos"") are a reserve unit and no one would have been there to ready the acft.

The sky was completely clear with no moon or clouds.  My wife suddenly exclaimed ""What is that!"" and pointed E-N/E. She continued to point at it and said: ""It went behind the trees."" I didn't see it, but she described it as ""v"" formation of light objects.  We continued discussing the event postulating what it might be.  Then, 15 minutes later (I checked my watch afterward to verify), I saw something directly overhead and pointed it out to her.  She remarked that it was the exact same thing she saw earlier.  We watched it fly rapidly from overhead to the E-N/E where it vanished behind the trees. What I was a formation of 25-30 light gray objects in a nearly perfect, but 'flattened', 'v' shape.  They were not illuminated but were distinct in the night sky.  Each object looked roughly square in shape and they were spaced very closely together with even distance.   The formation was completely silent as it went overhead.  The formation passed overhead and over the horizon in approximately 5 seconds.  The width in the sky was approximately the same as my hand extended at full reach.  (I would be happy to submit daylight photos of the location if it would be helpful)  I ran inside to get my camera and we spent the next 20 minutes waiting for another pass but never saw anything else.  During that period we observed several standard airplanes flying their usual routes.

I always look to a group of 3 horizontal Stars at 332 degrees NW because I’ve always loved the way they look from my home located in Keshena, Wi. I noticed a group of what I thought were vertical stars that I’ve never noticed before. I watched the group of 7 or so stars at 307 degrees NW start moving slowly (actually it had to be a fantastic speed after watching) at a south eastern direction. As this group moved MANY others followed that weren’t there earlier, they just seemed to appear from no where. The others just would pop out of the dark, cloudless sky and begin traveling a straight line across the sky, following one another, traveling over me, layin! g on my back looking up, also moving in the SW direction IN a straight formation. These STARS were not Jet Planes or Satellites (I’ve observed both and I have viewed the space station travel across the sky a few times, also from my home in Keshena, Wi) because occasionally 1 or 2 would pass one another very quickly or move around in the sky in fdother directions always going back into their place in line after a short time. I counted 31 of these STARS (UFO’s) only after I realized these were not stars I was watching. Most of them followed each other in a perfect line, except a few that made some unbelievable movements at unbeatable speed. These STARS all started to disappear after going a very long distance over head in a very short period of time (I watched all of these UFO’s go from one end of the sky to the other in about 20 minutes. All of these objects suddenly Started to disappeared 1 after another when they reached a certain point in the sky at 121 degrees SE. I have! observed a few other objects from my home in Keshena, Wiscons! in 54135 from time to time. Never have I observed more than 2 objects at once (5 times it was 1 object, 3 times I watched 2 objects “playing with one another”) This actually scared me a little, after I started to understand what I just witnessed.  I didn’t know what these could be except UFO’s.  I observed these UFO’s for approximately 25 minutes after I decided to write the time and direction of travel down in my phone. I am NOT a nut, I am being truthful about everything. I hadn’t started counting until I realized these stars were actually UFO’s.

It maintained the approx. 20 degrees above the horizon.  The ridgeline is a wooded area.  For approx. twenty minutes the object flew very slowly over the ridgline with a steady slow speed.  At some point it started, what looked like a descend towards the ground.  I was now watching it with my binoculars.  It was shining very bright.  Through my binoculars it looked like as if it was now on the ground between the trees and was radiating a clearly visible and strong Halo.  After a couple of minutes it just went out and was gone. I tried to photgraph it with my Samsung phone. The three photos are attached.  The moment the photos were shot is the moment where the object started its descend. I also attached a daylight Picture from my Apartment to the ridgeline to put the pictures into perspective. The daylight picture is not related to the incident. The same event happend the next day.

My husband and I have been monitoring these light/UAPs/UFOs for over 2 years now. At this point, we see one almost every night right outside our window. The UFO is a bright light, there are minor differences like shapes, (circular vs diamond), light emissions, and coloration, but for the most part we feel we are seeing the same things, multiples of them, many different times. They move and we track them but mostly they stay stationary or only more slightly. We can easily monitor this as we live in a wooded area and it’s easy to notice where it’s located in relation to the trees. Recently they’ve been more “obvious” like a bright “star” right in front of us, “following” us home, and being directly outside our windows at night. Today was the first time I tried to record them with some phenomenal results. I recorded a video and took very clear and obvious photos with my iPhone and DSLR. The iPhone videos were surprisingly clear showing a large bright circle, su! rrounding a smaller circle with a dark “core” like center. I took multiple videos all showing the same thing. When zooming in the outer brighter circle was flickering/emitting/spinning. When we went outside to investigate further we spotted another and proceeded to verify via video. The shape and characteristics were both the same. We could see both at the same time.  To note, we both have a masters degree, I being a research biologist and  very familiar with star positioning, plausible tech explanation and so forth. Theses “lights” have been phenomenal experiences. Please contact for further  photos and video, would love to have them investigated further.

My fiancee and I went out to my vehicle to have a cigarette, because we couldn't sleep.  He was looking at his phone and I was just sitting there looking out the windshield for no particular reason waiting for my phone to load a game.  My phone acted strange.  It lagged in strange way I'd not experienced before.  So, I was randomly looking out the windshield waiting for it to load, smoking my cigarette.  It was a pitch black night with no stars visible.  All of a sudden a glowing green oval orb appeared in the sky.  It had a darker green spot in the center of it.  It hovered in one place, after it just appeared out of nowhere.  It took my breath away and I stared in shock at first then I startled as it then moved in a perfect ark manuever to the right and down.  I gasped at that point and was about to tell my fiancee look at what I'm seeing!  As soon as I gasped and was in shock, I started to get my fiancees attention to look!.  Then, it just disappeared before he could look up.  Whether its light went out or took off fast, idk.  I googled green orbs to find out if it was a meteor or ball lighting but meteors have a tail like a comet and ball lightening only appears w thunder storms.  I searched the internet for pics or videos of green orb unidentified objects in the sky and all looked very similar to what I saw.  I saved two pics off of the web as they look very similar, nearly identical to what I saw.  The only difference is the inside of the green orb I saw had a darker green dot in center vs the white dot in the pics I found on the web.  Has ANYONE on this sight ever reported anything like this?  OR know if it was a natural phenomena or military device etc.  Any info on this would be appreciated.   I'm still in awe I saw an unidentified object in the sky last night!  We had a 4.4 earthquake Sunday, the day before.  Then 30 minutes after the quake, we saw 2 military choppers fly over.  So that too is why I wonder if it could be night military craft.  But I didn't get the feeling it was or was a meteor as it moved strategically irradically and hovered.  Just stunned at the bizzarity we may not be alone and such phenomena in the sky never is directly explained.

The event lasted 4 minutes.  We were driving through Harriman State Park in Rockland County, NY (approximately 45 minutes north of NYC), the roads are unlit after dark which made the experience even clearer to see.  We saw 3 individual crafts, disc shaped with 2 lights on each craft in a triangle formation and the 3 objects were completely stationary in the sky.   I proceeded to pull over immediately after sighting this and confirmed with my 3 passengers that we were all seeing the same thing.  Everyone confirmed.  The moment I turned my headlights off, the 3 craft, still in formation, increased their altitude suddenly, then proceeded to move to the west at an incredible rate of speed.  They went from zero to what seemed like thousands of miles per hour in the blink of an eye.  As they moved west they gradually increased altitude until they were no longer visible. The total time we watched this was 4 minutes, so at 23:39 the event was over. I am a former EMT/Paramedic, the 3 people I was with were 1.  Retired NYPD Sergeant,  2. A Trauma/ER Nurse and 3.  Former US Marine Force Recon Soldier, all of us I firmly believe are very credible, reliable and completely sane.  Nobody was under the influence of any drug or alcohol. I had an experience in Harriman State Park approximately 20 years ago, but I was by myself so never reported it.  In that instance I saw a glowing green light about 5 feet over my car (I could see it through my sunroof) speed past me very low to the ground at an alarming rate of speed, then took off into the sky and disappeared.  I'm completely skeptical, but I do know what I saw on both occasions and am really glad I wasn't alone this time.  If you'd like further details please contact me.  Thank you.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,,

Two years ago my brother and I were fishing the surf after dark when we noticed very strange lights in the sky.  Here is the link to that report:   http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/136/S136513.html   After reporting what we saw to NUFORC two years ago, we realized that the amount of orange light sightings off the coast of SC is stunning, so we knew that our chances were fair to possibly see them again.  So during our 2018 beach trip we went out to the beach for a bit a few different nights… but we didn't see anything, so this year we returned with the idea to hike out to the beach consistently each night, set up our chairs, and look for anything strange from 7:30pm - 10:00pm. Saturday, Sunday, and Monday nights we saw nothing.  But on Tuesday night at 7:53pm we saw the start of an amazing display!  My father, brother, sister in-law and myself were all at the beach when all of a sudden two bright orange lights appeared approximately 1-2 miles up the coast, seemingly over the beach itself... maybe even over a nearby hotel.  It's hard to approximate their altitude, but they couldn't have been more than a thousand feet off the ground.  The light on top was larger and brighter, while the one below it was smaller and more faint, but both were clearly visible. When we noticed them they were already visible, so we didn't see how they appeared.  They did not move in any direction.  We watched them for about 20-30 seconds, before the larger and brighter one slowly faded out, immediately followed by the smaller light fading out as well.  The entire time they were visible they made no sound, and there was no smoke in the sky. All 4 of us saw the lights, and everyone was so excited. In 2017 my brother and myself were the only ones on the beach when the lights appeared, so having the validation of two more adults in our family seeing the lights was great.  We kept a watch out for more, but after about 30 minutes or so my dad and sister in law decided to head back to the house. However, my brother and I stayed. Shortly after they left, we noticed that two fighter jets flew over the coast at a very low altitude and speed.  One had what seemed to be normal lights on, while the other had only a couple very minimal green lights and was very hard to see.  It was too dark to see what they were exactly, but they were most like FA-18's from the nearby Marine Corp Air Station in Beaufort, SC.  They were extremely loud, in star contrast to the silent orange lights we had seen. These were the only such planes we saw the entire week, so we though it was worth noting since it was about 30 mins after the lights appeared. Then, at 8:47pm, almost 50 minutes after we initially saw the two orange lights to the north, things got really interesting out over the water. Straight out and slightly to the south from where we were sitting, orange lights began fading in and out for short periods of time. It's hard to say how far apart they were (they were further away from us than the first lights). There could have easily been miles of space between the individual lights at times, and other times they appeared close to each other. Between 8:47 and 8:57 these lights turned on and off (always gradually fading in and out) at in different places out over the ocean. At first they were not moving, but completely stationary. Then, we saw one moving south. It faded in, stayed lit momentarily, then started to fade out again. But as one light disappeared, a previously unseen sphere positioned next to it lit up. Then when that light faded out, one next to it faded in. The lights turned on and off down the line a t! otal of six times, then the last one faded out. It was as if a straight line formation of 6 objects was traveling south at the same speed and lighting up one at a time in from east to west. After that one or two more lights faded in and disappeared here and there for a minute or two, but that was all we saw that evening, and we didn’t see anything else every following night for the rest of the week. These were the exact same lights we had seen two years ago. How are these appearing with such predictability and frequency and yet nobody is talking about it? Whatever is out there, it's an amazing thing to behold, and it was a treat to get a glimpse at the lights again!  Unfortunately I couldn't get my phone to focus on the lights because it was so dark on the beach. However, I made some animations which I'm submitting to NUFORC to show what we saw. The positions and time of appearance are approximate of course, but these animations accurately convey what we saw looking out over the waves.

At approximately the time and date provided, a loud high pitched jet engine and the sound of the air rushing from the source became suddenly and overwhelmingly audible. This had happened, I state this as a critically important note, a few times before at the location in Five Points, Florida; the low income community in Columbia County that is just a mile or so due North beyond the Lake City city limit if travelling via US441 North. I quickly exited the home located near the county jail on Quentin Street; no surprise befell me when I gazed up to find an impressive looking, but all too familiar, mid sized, jet engine driven aircraft. (I had seen this craft or one almost identical on two other occasions). This craft appeared to my eyes to be quite similar to a harrier jet used by the United States Marine Corps. For the third time over the course of a year I witnessed this craft almost at a standstill but suspended over the area just a few dozen feet North and East of the address in which I was visiting that night. Nothing prior to this event could have prepared me for what occurred within seconds. This night was cloudless the clearest a night could be, but still the craft began to ascend quite rapidly and in less than the proceeding 3 seconds; possibly less as I was completely awe stricken; the craft was gone, though it was just as loud as before. The  even being illuminated on the bottom by 4 bright bluish lights and having some other source of an apparently incandescent orange glow emanating from it the craft completely vanished into a clear night sky leaving behind only the overpowering auditory disturbance of its harrier type turbine. It was approximately one minute before the craft was no longer in range of my ability to hear. Please note that I became extensively educated on the branches of military and all of their publically known weapons systems, vehicles and other various aspects of militaria as an answer to a passion for learning about the history my country. I intended to serve as a soldier in the U.S Army, but a technicality prohibited my enlistment.  I have witnessed many strange occurrences over the last two years most frequently and not exclusively but especially having come to pass in our skies. I fear something sinister and most unpleasant is on the immediate horizon and the number of craft in our skies keeping tabs on us renders us helpless to do anything to avoid submission.

Object appeared reflective.  Sighting was not discussed with any other crew members or passengers. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Peter I did not mention it to others on the aircraft and the date is accurate within a week or so.  I was actually familiar with the flight crew, as I take this fight many times a month but the cockpit door was closed as we disembarked so the opportunity didn’t exist to discuss.     I don’t want to get into the details of what I do for a living but I fly a lot, sometimes many times a week.  I’m very familiar with most types of aircraft, both civilian and military (and I’ve flow on over 25 types personally).  I’ve seen similar objects on two separate occasions over the last 15-20 years.  Both were metallic spheres, one was a metallic green and the other more red and they seemed to have a slight glow… and both, I recall, seemed disturbingly close to the aircraft.  Those, if I recall correctly, happened over the mid-west but it was many years ago.  I believe one was near DFW. The recent sighting was the first I’ve had in at least a decade.  The object just seemed to be metallic with no coloration.  But it was an extremely brief sighting. As I mentioned, the disturbing part to me is that these objects are flying, at high speed, well within safe commercial separation.  It’s hard to determine their actual size but maybe something akin to Sputnik.  They seem to have no visible means propulsion or ability to stay aloft (wing surface, stabilizers, etc) nor any other surface breaks, antenna, etc. I’ve always been reluctant to discuss but now that I’m on number three I feel compelled to figure it out.  I brought it up only once prior to a 777 pilot deadheading in a seat next to me but he wasn’t very eager to continue the line of conversation.  If they’re government controlled it’s amazing that such technology exists but, at the same time, seemingly dangerous practice.  Especially over such busy airspace as the Los Angeles Basin.

As the objects passed from our far left to far right field of vision we began seeing more and more of these objects essentially moving in a staggered line formation and stretching for well over a mile. It took at least three minutes for them to all pass to the far right of our field of view and out of sight. There were several triangle formations within this staggered line but it appeared they were three separate o! bjects, not on me triangular shaped object. There was no sound and no bright lights. Just a steady line of these dots that were unambiguously remarkable. The sky was completely clear and there were no clouds. After approx two minuites of watching I ran to get another friend who confirmed what we were seeing as he was still able to see about ten of these objects in the last minute or so that they were visible so that makes five witnesses total. .

The sky was very clear and cold out about 25 degrees. She was looking the stars of the night. When she observed a couple of lights moving across the sky in a spaced out pattern. There became more, which seemed to be popping out of the black space. She felt if she left to wake me up from sleep would be fruitless that they would be gone. Well, they kept coming, and then awoke me from my sleep to see these lights.  Well I did see the lights after about 12 of them had already moved on and they just kept coming out of dark space. Just fainter then some of the bright stars, but they kept coming out of the dark up rather high in the sky. No blinking, but much like satellites, they moved off with no sound. A propeller plane was coming by now behind us low and I was hoping they somehow would see this two. This continued for maybe 15- 20 minutes and we counted 40 lights total moving in the same direction toward the Bridger Mtns. and NE.. Twice 2 of these lights popped out at the same time.  The best description I can give is like that TV denture cleaning commercial where they pull a string of pearls out of a baked fruit pie, one after another in a very precised spaced out pattern.

While relaxing on my back porch after a long day of work I noticed what appeared to be a flashing satellite.  The trajectory was circumpolar and velocity was consistant with average satellites.  The object was first noticed at the zenith.  The first flash was of approximately -6 magnitude brightness and lasted 3 seconds.  So far this seemed normal for a rotating solar paneled satellite.  Every 22 seconds the object flashed at a consistent magnitude until it disappeared over the northern horizon.   The odd thing is the flashing was consistent brightness as though the light was radiating all directions.  Normal rotating satellites will flash at most twice before the change in orbital position relative to the observer makes the solar panels flash to a single spot on the earth's surface.  The next flash would be hundreds of miles away from the observer one would think.   This is the first time I’ve seen this phenomenon and have seen thousands of satellites in my skywatching. This is my 23rd unexplainable sighting of aerial phenomena. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Still night with no wind. Event:  I’ve documented an intelligent light on three other occasions and wrote a report 4-12-18 on the second sighting last year.  I’ll post the first and second encounter below. Over the winter of 2018/2019 I set out a game camera to take a photo every hour to try and capture the recurring light that seems to appear in the same location during the night and disappear when seen.  I was able to capture what I believed to be the light but the camera does not take the best low light images. Last night I was waiting for the northern lights to come out to photograph with a couple of guests staying with me when a light appeared over Blight Island to the west while we were sitting around a campfire (fire nearly out by this time and a few stars starting to shine).  I immediately got excited and pointed it out to the guests where they confirmed on seeing it as well.  It formed starting a small light and got brighter turning a red/orange color.  The guests commented that the light was pulsating.  About 40 seconds had gone by and I told them to keep their eye on it and ran to the office to get my camera with a telephoto lens.  As I ran up and turned the lights on to the lodge deck/office I heard them yell that it disappeared (approx. saw it for 1 min).  I grabbed my camera and came back and the light was gone.  They said as soon as the lights came on the light “blinked” off.   At the same time I was walking down the steps off the deck my cousin walked around the corned! to join the campfire and asked what was going on.  We told him and after a few minutes of excitement of what just occurred he walked back to his room to get a camera.  I along with the other 2 guests sat back down to wait for it to get a little darker in hopes to see the northern lights when the light again appeared again in the exact same spot.  I spoke up to say there it is and watched it for about 10 seconds.  The other two guests see it as well for another 10 seconds when it slowly starts to disappear and doesn’t get as bright as the first time.  Just then my cousin walks up and misses seeing it a second time.  We sit out for another hour but don’t see anything else.  My cousin and I walk to another cabin and look one last time in the general direction when I spot the light start to form again (approx. 1:30am).  As I point it out and grab him by the shoulder to look, it “blinks off” as I call out its location.  We wait for another 15 mins but decide to go to bed after ! this.  The next morning, I remember that I still had my game c! amera ou t and check to see if the light was captured.  Sure enough it was (low quality).  But I can now show where in location of the sky it forms and circled it in red for others to see where to look.  I believe this is recurring light similar to the Martha lights in TX.  But with an intelligence.   I’ve seen it over several years now starting in 2016, always in the same spot. Sept 13, 2018  Where:  Prince William Sound, (Port Fidalgo) Alaska Title:  Intelligent Light in sky disappears when spotted by observer Duration:  1 minute Exact time: 1:37am Weather Conditions:  Clear sky, lots of stars.  Still night with no wind. Event:  I live in a remote part of Alaska and host fishing and hunting guests when a couple of hunters went missing and I had to call the coast guard to find them.  As the coast guard chopper came into view they started to search to the west of where we were.  As I looked up the coastline from our dock, I watched the chopper looking into different bays and I would run back to the main office (150’) where 3 other people were helping coordinate and to talk to the USCG by phone.  As I was running back and forth a bright light appeared out of no where above Bligh Island to my west.  I had seen this light earlier in the spring (documented on nuforc last year 4-12-2018) and wanted someone else to see the light before it disappeared.  I was afraid to call out from the dock and thought it might disappear and remembered not to focus on looking directly at.  After a few moments of not being able to get anyone’s attention in the main office, I looked directly at it to get a better view! and POOF it disappeared.   I then focused on the situation at hand and we would later find the two hunters safely camped out on a beach who decided to just spend the night in the outdoors without telling anyone.

At first I thought it was traffic going by but after it kept waking me up I stood up and open the curtains to see where it was coming from which is when I found out it was coming from my sons car outside in our driveway.  His car lights kept turning on and then off sometimes it only lasted a couple of seconds and sometimes quickly flashed on and off.  As I looked to the south west I could see behind the tree line moving blue red and white light.    My husband woke up to ask what that was all about and I told him and luckily the lights like a craft and then on the car lights again so I sent husband down to see if our son was doing something with his car but my husband went outside and looked around the house and found our son sleeping so he didn’t wan! t to wake him up to ask him.  This morning I ask my son if he was doing something with his car last night and he said no and I asked him if he was maybe rolling over on the key fab and he said no the key fabs battery was dead.

I called it to the attention of others, five were pretty close friends.  Several took snapshot pictures of the craft.  The officer with us definitely saw the craft as well.  We observed the craft for at least four minutes, till the bus moved past the stop sign. Within 50 feet, our bus was surrounded by AF Security Police, in full combat gear, in jeeps and trucks.  The officers entered our bus and took everyone's cameras and removed the film on the spot!  We were hustled the bus into a nearby hanger serving as offices.  We were officially debriefed and sworn to secrecy under threats of prison for revealing anything about what we had observed in the hanger, then released.  These people were dead serious.

Re: My UFO Experience Dear sir/ma’am.  In March of 1985, I was a 20 year-old active-duty medic in the army.  I volunteered for duty- doing  temporary duty (TDY) in Central America assigned to the 8th Hospital. This was in Honduras’ Palmerola Air Base, near the town of Comayaqua. The only night I would ever do guard duty during the six months there, both Pfc. (blank) and myself observed an anomalous entity cross the night’s sky.  The “guard station” itself was a wooden structure with sand bag-reinforced walls and ceiling. We were allowed to lay up on the roof of that bunker and stargaze for the evening-no contact was expected with others…very isolated part of the base:  “Just report back if you see or hear anything “out of the ordinary.”  So, both Biscotti & I laid up atop that makeshift bunker admiring how clear that moonless night’s sky was.  With minimal light pollution, and almost a total field of view from horizon-to-horizon, as we were in the middle of the huge Comayagua Valley.  (Years later I would become a commercial sailor, so that night’s conditions were almost like being on the open ocean-optimum conditions.)  Also, no clouds or water vaper or suspended ice crystals in the upper atmosphere were observed. At approx. 01:30am it appeared, rising up, above the mountain range to our West.  It was a bright point of light (generic white light) several magnitudes brighter than any other celestial object observed that night.  Out of the west, it arced up swiftly, reaching its apogee, almost overhead of us in less than 15 seconds.  It came to an immediate stand still, resting for about 4-5 seconds, then, with no apparent “gradual”/ gradient/ exponential increase in speed, it arced downward by approx.  10-15 degrees, stopped for around 3-4 seconds, arced over to one side, stopped, performed one more arcing maneuver, stopping one last time for around 5-8 seconds.  Then it shot off…arcing away, down towards the other side of the valley to our East. It appeared to have only two speeds…dead-stop…or full tilt throttle open fast.  My point is that no acceleration could be noticed from my observation…one could only guess as to the actual speed of that object. Years later, I would see the International Space Station (ISS) traveling across the sky, either right before sun rise or right after sunset.  It takes more than 6 minutes for the ISS to cross the nights sky if its apogee is close to overhead…at 17,500 mph.  So, what would take the ISS 3 minutes to be above us, that thing did in 15 seconds!  That’s roughly 8 times faster than the ISS, so doing the math you get a speed of approx. 140,000mph!  Depending on orbital height…  Well, that’s my story…I always wondered if (blank) thought about that night in the years since…if he saw value or, at least, a little wonder & awe in the experience…for me the experience was like having an open-ended question bouncing around in your head…with no one to satisfy the itch it leaves behind… I find solace in the fact that just writing about the experience gives me a kind of closure…    Thanks for reading…  (name withheld) HS-BCP Human Services-Board Certified Practitioner  (Written 19June2019) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was 16 years old at this time, driving with a friend down a country road.  There were open farm fields on either side of the road.  The sky was clear (no major cloud cover) but it was quite dark.  We noticed three lights in the sky to the left of the road probably a mile ahead.  As we got closer, we slowed down because the thing we saw looked so strange. It was a very large black triangle shape flying quite low and slow.  The low flying altitude is what first caught our attention, as this was highly unusual.  I could only guess it was several hundred feet long.  It was completely silent.  It had one large white light at each of the three corners.  They seemed to be facing forward like three searchlights or headlights or something.  Definitely not like the small marker lights on airplane wings or the landing lights I had seen on planes heading into the airport (which was nowhere near where we were). We were dumbfounded that this huge thing could be up in the air, moving as slow as it was, without making any sound.  It was too big to be a plane.  Didn’t look like any balloon or blimp I had ever seen.  We were freaking out, but at the same time just couldn’t believe what we were seeing and didn’t want to stop tracking it.  We basically slowed to a stop, as the object was flying toward us on our left, still going over the field.  We eventually got scared and drove away, since we figured we were sitting ducks and whoever was in the thing was certainly watching our headlights. I wish I had a camera or cellphone to record it.  This was pre-Internet and I had never seen or heard of anything like this object prior to this encounter.  Up to that point, my only concept of a UFO was of a flying saucer or disk of some sort.  If my friend wasn’t with me to witness it, I would have felt like I was crazy or something. Ironically, only a few months later, I was at a friend’s house and there was this coffee table book about UFO’s on the living room end table.  I was just randomly flipping through pages, not really expecting to see anything in particular.  Lo and behold, I see a photo of exactly what we saw.  My stomach dropped.  Other people had seen this thing too! Now with the internet, I’ve come to find that what I saw is actually quite common, other than the configuration of the lights not always being the same.  It’s quite gratifying to know that we weren’t the only ones to see this peculiar sight.  If this thing had been moving fast, I think I would have been much more skeptical.  Maybe just a super high tech military plane, perhaps.  It was the astoundingly slow speed that got me, like how the heck is this not falling out of the sky!   And it’s way bigger than any plane!  It still spooks me out thinking about how intense that moment was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a benchmark moment that was permanently burned into my memory and I can recall it today, as clearly I could on the day it happened.  Even then, at the time, I had no doubt that what I was observing was something extremely strange. MY UFO SIGHTING:  So this took place about 20 miles northeast of Los Angeles, California, in the San Gabriel Valley, in the suburban city of Monrovia.  It was in the fall and I remember school had just started a few weeks back.  I remember that It had been cold and wet for a few days, and had rained for most of that day while I was at school.  Toward the end of the day, it was kind of gusty but seemed like it was clearing out. So after school, I did what most kids in the neighborhood did, and jumped on my bike, and met up with a couple of friends that lived around the block.  In addition to riding our bikes all over the place, one of our favorite things to do was “explore” around construction sites.  Luckily for us, right around this time, on a lot directly next to our friend's house, there was an old small house with a massive yard, that had dense avocado trees in the back, which they had recently bulldozed some time ago (with us watching delighted at all the excitement) and they were now in the process of building four attached Townhouses on the site. At the time when this happened, it was basically just a two-story wood frame construction site, with about half of the roof built, a couple of fiberglass bathtubs, exposed pipes and such; as the floor plan and rooms were barely discernible and just beginning to take shape.  But they had constructed a couple sets of stairs at this point, and I recall we were excited about the prospect of being able to climb up and check out the second floor.  Anyway, so along side all of this, was like open trenches with wooden sticks, concrete framing and the usual stuff that one would find when building a house — but since it had rained, there was this very huge area of mud.  We thought was the cool because it was like super thick, and had pooled in such a way that there was an undisturbed ‘skin’ on the top of it, and had the consistency of chocolate pudding. So it was just two of us, my friend from school and myself.  Having checked out the site, we were now outside on our bikes, taking turns driving through this muck, completely coating our tires with this stuff, and seeing who could make it the farthest (without peddling) by rolling into this mud, and trying not to slow down too much, or we’d loose our balance, and have to put our feet down into it.  Anyway, we were having a ball, and enjoying ourselves completely. Then, at almost the same time, something super bright caught our eye and our attention. I remember us both standing there and now looking up at something shining in the sky. Something so bright, something so huge, something completely inexplicable and totally strange, something gleaning and shimmering, and something that just seemed propped up, poised, or ‘hanging’ way up in the sky. The sky was overcast with dark grey clouds, and it being the later part of the afternoon, it was on its way to being dark in a short amount of time.  So against that dreary backdrop was this exceedingly bright, totally out-of-place, totally abnormal, gigantic ‘thing’ — My friend was standing to my left and was the first to say something, and said “Woah, WHAT is THAT?"" ….I said, “I don’t know, ….I have NO idea”.  I had no clue what it was we were looking at, but perched high up in the sky, roughly to our 2 o’clock (Northeast) and partially obscured at the bottom by clouds, was a diamond-shaped (somewhat faceted) or for lack of a better description, basically a pyramid-shaped object.  The shape of this object and the dimensions were semi difficult to make out, because it was glowing so brightly.  It was as if it was encased or enveloped (in what I would now describe as similar to a plasma-like light) that surrounded it, and was radiating and reflecting from it.  [*Correspond! s to Position #1 in attached drawings] It was shimmering, dazzling and sparkling, and seemed to reflect every color of copper, silver, gold, white, yellow, orange, fiery red, etc. — all those colors all at once!! I used to describe it as almost “cartoonish” …Like it was an animated creation that someone created in Toon-Town and it escaped.  Whatever it was, it was a remarkably brilliant display.  The light off this thing was backlighting some of the surrounding clouds, and making the clouds around it on all sides glow.  I thought then, that without a doubt everyone in Los Angeles, much less the entire western USA, must be seeing this anomaly too! I mean, this was something I imagined would be impossible to miss, or so I thought.  I naively surmised that this was going to be the leading story on the nightly news, without a doubt. So I remember staring at this thing, and it’s like your brain is quickly spinning your mental Rolodex, but can’t really classify or quantify what it is you’re looking at.  We had no frame of reference for something like this.  I had a slim knowledge-base about anything to do with UFO’s in general at that age, but was vaguely aware of pop culture ‘flying saucers’ and the like, and so my brain could wrap itself around the notion that those things, as seen in movies, at least resembled ‘vehicles’ or spaceships, and that I could somewhat envision people, or beings, or whatever, zipping around in those type of crafts.  However, this thing we saw didn’t register with us (at the time) as being any type of aerial vehicle, spaceship, or anything of the sort.  Certainly not something you could ‘ride’ in, I remember thinking. It was just this crazy big glowing weird-shaped thing sitting there.  (Who flys around in a glowing pyramid I thought to myself?!) Immediately,  I remember the very firs! t thing that popped in my head, was maybe it was hot air balloon, because I remembered seeing on TV once, these balloons flying in the evening time and how when someone pulled the cord, the fire would light up, and once airborne, it would make them look like floating Chinese lanterns.  But just as soon as this thought came, I could quickly rule it out.  This thing although appearing quite some distance away, was massive.  Like I’d estimate it was 1.5 times the diameter of the full moon.  It was obvious to us within milliseconds that this was not a plane, and not something ordinary or conventional.  We were spellbound and speechless, with our necks craned just staring at this thing. So from this point, where we had first sighted it, along the western edge of this construction site, we then made our way maybe 20-30 yards south down toward the street, to continue observing the object, and to try to get a better unobstructed view.  I remember vividly wanting to get someone’s attention and as soon as I saw anyone, I had planned on shouting “Look, LOOK at THAT!” — and as I quickly scanned up and down the block, but I was astounded that  there was nobody out — no cars coming, nothing, no one.  [*Corresponds to Position #2 in attached drawings]  We continued looking at this object, as we slowly moved from the middle of the street, walking with our bikes diagonally toward the sidewalk, where we stood and then, just as oddly as it appeared, it was gone. Just like that. [*Corresponds to Position #3 in attached drawings]  This entire sighting lasted no more than 3 minutes in total, from start to finish. It never moved, or did anything. It made no sound whatsoever.  It was literally there, and then it was literally gone. It never ”did” anything.  Apart from a couple of milliseconds spent looking around for a neighbor, or anyone else to call attention to this thing, we both never took our eyes off of it.  It was there, then it was not; just like that. So, needless to say, we were totally pumped up and excited — exclaiming “WOWS” and “WOAHS” back and forth to each other.  We stood there for a few minutes, baffled and perplexed about what that was, where it had went, and if it’d be coming back. So we jumped on our bikes and rode around the block toward my friend's house, and a couple of houses down from his house, we spotted our mutual friend who was on her porch, saying goodbye to her mom, and  standing there with grandmother (who owned the house).  I remember that her mom worked at the clothing store ‘Mervyns’ and was hastily getting into her car to leave for work, just as we pulled up.  Of course we told them all what we had seen, she sort of chuckled and was kind of dismissive and backed out in her car, in a rush.  [*Corresponds to Position #4 in attached drawings]  However our friend’s grandmother said that she absolutely believed us, and went on to tell us how she once saw something really strange in the sky decades ago, and then proceeded to ask if we’d like to borrow her husband’s binoculars to scan the sky to see if our object returns.  We naturally thought this was an excellent idea, and emphatically accepted.  So we went out to the sidewalk and sat around passing these big clunky binoculars around, trying to figure out how they worked and if we could see anything at all, but of course we didn’t.  I also recall going home that night and drawing what I had seen, and show it to my mom, and tell her about it.  I remember she was less-than-receptive about it, and was more interested in us getting ready for dinner, which she was in the middle of preparing. So slowly, but surely, I kind of forgot about it.  From time to time, I would occasionally think and reflect on it.  I would say having seen something like this may have kickstarted, or helped in laying the groundwork for my broader interest in such topics, and assisted with my keeping an open mind to items of high strangeness.  The world is full of very strange things, and my personal belief is that there is a lot more going on around us then we could ever imagine.

My best friend would come over every day after school and we would dig with garden trowels for fun.  He was crouched to my left digging alongside me one day, and as I turned to speak to him I saw a spiky black ball floating about 2.5 feet off the ground.  It looked like a matte black sea urchin, the body portion was roughly basketball-sized, with approx. 1 foot long spikes protruding in every direction.  The object did not have a metallic or reflective surface.  My friend saw my eyes go wide and he looked as well. The object passed us close enough that I could have reached out and touched it.  It floated past him, then past me and through our wooden fence without breaking form whatsoever.  It phased through like one would imagine a ghost walking through a solid object.  It turned around the corner of the house and I never saw it again. Thankfully, I was a clever enough kid to ask my friend what he saw first so he wouldn't just agree with me in his panic.  He described the same thing I had seen.  I almost wish I hadn't asked him first, because now I can't write this off as my imagination.   I recently found him online and asked him if he remembers the event as it has been nearly 20 years.  He does recall the event as I described, except that he remembers the object/entity as a ""purple blob"" and not as a spiky black ball.

First, because I almost died from a major heart attack last year that required triple bypass, emergency surgery on both lungs and kidney failure. I am still recuperating to this day. And second because I know what happened that night was real and I feel that it should be remembered and put on record. Please forgive me, I am not a writer and will do the best I can with telling what I remember as it was a long time ago. Dates and times are approximate but the experience is well remembered. This incident happened around  midnight or a little later in the morning one night in 1984 0r 85. I remember being awaken by sounds that seemed like they were coming from the kitchen. Of course I was startled and did not know if maybe one of my young sons were in the kitchen or if it was a burglar. Also, I wasn’t sure what the humming sound was  that I was hearing and decided I needed to get up and investigate. As I was going to pull back the covers to get out of bed, It was then that I realized that I couldn’t move. I was frozen as if I was paralyzed from head to toe! I tried to turn my head to wake up my wife. I couldn’t turn my head or even call out to her. I couldn’t even speak. The only thing I could move were my eyes so needless to say, I was pretty much terrified at this point. We kept the vent light on above the stove so we, and our oldest son, could see and be able to get  down the hallway to the bathroom at night. As I was laying on my back and looking at the light shining on the hall wall, I noticed shadow movement that made me realize that someone, or something was in the kitchen and  moving down the hall toward our bedroom. Our sons bedroom was directly across the hall from ours. At this point two of the beings walked to my sons opened door and looked in, without turning on the light, and one came into our bedroom. They were about four feet tall and looked like the grey ET’s that I’ve seen as described on TV since this incident. Then one who looked similar to the other three, except was about a foot taller, walked in followed by the two that were at my kids door a minute earlier. Even though I didn’t hear anything except for the continued humming noise, it looked to me like they were communicating to each other and even using hand motions to each other. After moment of this, one of them walked to my left side, one to my right side and one to my feet. The taller one stayed back by the bedroom door. They held something like a scanner, about the size of a cell phone, holding them a couple inches above and went up and down my body, including my neck and head, for maybe a minute. The last I remember from that visit was the three shorter beings following the taller one out of the bedroom and down the hall. The next thing I remember was being awakened by the alarm clock to get ready for work at daylight. Of course the first thing I wanted to do was ask my wife if she remembered anything that happened the night before but she was still asleep when I left for work. And though I wanted to, I was too scared of what people might think of me to tell anybody at work about what happened. When I told my wife about it after work, she couldn’t and wouldn’t believe any of it. That’s when I decided to keep it to myself. This is a TRUE story and it happened!",,30.43996197183099,-88.75735633802817

I was for holidays on Chios island, specific on a village called Viki which is on the northern part of the island.  I was with some friends of mine outside the village for a walk, nightime with a very clear sky and full moon.  We were looking up to the sky to see some stars falling and I was looking all around to see a falling star.  A friend of mine told me to stare to a specific place cause I had more possibilities to see a star falling.  So I did.  I was down from the road electric light and above of me was the full moon.  So I had good front and back light.  As I was gazing the beautiful and clear sky, hearing the cicadas and feeling the light air coming on me I suddenly saw it.  I was frozen. A flying rectangular transparent object with no sound passed in front of my eyes, under the full moon and above the road electric light.  I could see its outline and also the stars behind it.  It might have been about 300-400 meters above and it was flying very harmoniously, it was moving so smoothly and peacefully in the sky like a bird with its wings opened.  It had no lights, nothing else on it that I saw.  From the time I saw it until it disappeared in the darkness there were passed about 4-5 seconds.  The speed of it wasn't so high, it was like spying with no lights and being transparent.  I'm thinking that somehow repulses the photons going over it so thats why I couldn't see it.

I was driving around 9 at night along Kimball Bridge Rd, about to turn right onto Waters Rd. My dad was in the passenger seat. Movement in the sky caught my eye and I looked up and to the left.  If the craft was somewhat close to the ground, it was maybe as big as a football field. I only got a detailed look at the front of it, so I saw it as being diamond shaped. It was pitch black which made it easier to see against the navy blue of the sky and the greyish clouds. At each corner was a big circular light, each one a different color.  One was amber, another was turquoise.  I can't recall which of those two colors was in the front corner.  I immediately called my dad's attention to it.  It was difficult for me to get a clear look at it since I was driving and my dad, there because I only had a learner's permit, kept telling me to keep my eyes on the road. I slowed my car to consistently look between the UFO and the road. I reached for my phone in the cup holder, and my dad stopped me and told me he'd get a picture.  By the time he reached for his phone, we had turned onto Waters Rd, heading in the same direction of the craft. For a couple seconds we were right under it so it was hard to see it in its entirety through the windshield, but that soon changed as it was going at a faster speed than us. My dad, not skilled with technology and without the aid of his reading glasses, fumbled to find the camera app while still trying to keep an eye on the craft and my speed, and he ultimately failed to take a picture .  It was considerably faster than us, but moved soundlessly at a steady speed. The speed limit was 35mph and my dad prevented me from going much faster. Tall trees line most of the road, so we lost sight of the craft any time we came to a larger curve. By the time we got halfway to  two thirds of the way down Waters Rd (.7 to .9 miles) we'd completely lost sight completely.  At home, my dad and I, without discussing the details of the UFO, each drew what we saw. He, having seen the back of the craft clearer than I, drew a pentagonal house-shaped craft, with lights in the two back corners, whereas I drew a diamond with one light in the singular back corner.  After 3 days, my father changed his mind and decided we'd seen helicopters flying in formation, which doesn't explain how they were connected by darkness, how they emitted no noticeable sound, and why they had enormous colorful lights, no two the same color. However, he maintains that he saw a flying saucer with his father as kid.

The original time/dated stamped video is on my wife's iPhone.  We own an apartment on the 16th floor of a residential high-rise building in Astoria that overlooks the East River and the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge.  I was not at the apartment.  My wife and her mom were at the apartment.  My wife was trying out new clothes in the bedroom.   She looked out the window when her eyes were caught by a white-light, oval in shape.  She initially taught that it was a spy-drone but she commented to herself that “it was bigger than any drone she’s ever seen”.  Upon her closer look the light seemed to wobble in place.   My wife felt that she was watched—you know the feeling, we’ve all experienced someone looking at you while stopped at the red light and both drivers turn at the same time to look at each other.   My wife pointed this light out to her mom as she dressed and ran to get her cellphone and film from the balcony; that is when the video started.  It captures 10-seconds of this light that moved to a greater distance across the river, in the matter of seconds my wife ran for the phone.  As soon as the video started, as if the object knew it was being recorded or read my wife’s mental intention, it took off into the horizon fairly quickly.  Faster than any drone, helicopter or airplane could perform such a feat.  I rule out a drone due to the amount of light it emitted drones have to conserve their limited battery power.   Drones are not legal to fly in NYC.  The sun had already set so it was not light reflecting off any object.   From our apartment, every year, there is a fireworks which precedes the bigger show hosted by Macy’s every year.  The area flocks with thousands of people.  From our balcony we have a vantage point to view the show.  My point is that last year someone flew a drone to capture images of the fireworks and from our balcony we, and independently others, could clearly hear and visually track the drone with the blinking! red/blue lights and prop-noise.  The drone would fly close to! the river, climb up to about 300 feet fly around and dive again.  We’ve seen drones in other parts of the City and we are knowledgeable of them.   Living near LaGuardia Airport we are used to airplanes.  Living in the City we are used to helicopters and the rare blimp.  This was not the normal route of either.  This object, my wife and her mom said, was totally silent.  It was uniform in light; no multi-colored blinking or solid lights.  Again, NO SOUND!

It had been raining and cloudy all day and was now clear.  It appeared overcast to the far east and far west with small scattered clouds to the south.  It was completely clear overhead and to the north with a 5 to 10 kilometer breeze from the north west. It was about 5 degrees Celsius. As I entered the park, I noticed the stars seemed particularly bright and beautiful this night. I was grateful for good walking paths as it allowed me to concentrate on the night sky.  I was walking due west along the southern edge of the park parallel to Crown Valley Rd.  I prefer this area because it is shaded by trees from the bright parking lot lights at the north east corner of the park. At approximately 12:18 a.m. (I checked the time on my cell phone approximately 2 minutes later.  It was 12:20) three lights appeared from behind the clouds to the west at approximately 15-20 degrees up from the horizon and slightly north of my position.  They were headed straight east and never deviated from this path.  They were perfectly in line and in sync with each other and were white or light blue in color with similar intensity to nearby stars or a brightly lit satellite. (not as bright as the ISS)  They were moving across the sky at a similar rate to a slow satellite. As it was approaching almost directly overhead I decided I should check the time and attempt to record the event by video recording it.  But, when I pressed record the camera light came on and I thought this likely wouldn't work.  Instead of taking the time to go into settings to switch off the light, I decided it likely wouldn't show anything anyway and I didn't want to miss anything.  I put the phone back in my pocket. When I gazed back up at the lights I was utterly shocked to see that the lights were not three individually flying crafts but rather one very large craft with the three lights in the center or belly of the craft. I could not see any detail other than the lights and the shape. From the front of the craft to the first light was as long or longer than the distance from the first to last light and the same distance from the last light to the end of the craft. In other words, it was at least three times as long as the distance from the first to the last of the three lights or longer. It was long and narrow and slightly wider in the center area by the lights. An elongated diamond shape. It was dark gray in color, only slightly lighter in color than the black sky around it. While it clearly covered the stars in the back ground, it unfortunately did not pass under any of the brightest stars which would have made it much more obvious. Incidentally, it passed directly through the pot section of the Big Dipper.  At it's highest point overhead, I would estimate to have been 75 - 80 degrees from the horizon. It was completely silent. As the craft passed by I fully extended my arm and was just barely able to cover all three lights with the second knuckle of my index finger (22mm. wide). It would have required 3 or 4 fingers to cover the entire craft. This thing was absolutely massive!  It is extremely difficult to accurately estimate it's altitude however by the way it entered and left my vision I am quite certain that it was at least as high as an ordinary passenger jet at cruising altitude (30,000 - 35,000 ft). Indeed, it may well have been much much higher. It was 12:23 when I lost sight of it. I immediately entered notes in my phone. The event lasted approximately 4 1/2 - 5 minutes.

((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I am going to provide a map for a better idea on longitude and latitude below. We were on Farm Road 1000 coming around the first corner you will see veering off to the left on the map driving south towards the intersection of Farm Road 2280 in Washburn, Mo. I used the fire station as a reference point because it is probably less than a 1/2 mile from where we first seen it at 9:33 pm, Sunday May 27th.  Farm Road 1000, or as locals know it, Fletcher ridge is a dirt road, so we were going pretty slow.  By our location we turned right, the map view on the link, you will see in opposite view, heading toward Farm road 2280. We noticed odd lights as we were at the corner to our left, we were fascinated because it didn't look like a plane, then we saw it was hovering and the lights were not normal.  Then it shot to the right of us, in the blink of an eye, a little beyond the fire station and starting hovering again.  That's when we got a better view of the lights.   There were white and green lights, way larger than a commercial jet and the belly of it had a LARGE red circular light with lights within it.  By this time we were at the intersection fascination went to fear.  So if there we other colors, I don't know, but I know it had white, green and a very large red underbelly and much larger than a commercial plane.  We took a left and got the heck out of there.  I don't think we have ever hit the main road so fast.  We live in Republic, MO, and close to SFG and see planes every night out on our patio.  We have never seen anything like this before.  We grew up in the area and spent many nights backroading in our teen years and NEVER seen anything like this.

I saw two and a small rat with a sore on the side.  It feels scary because it feels as if something is here above and they are landing more and more.  Maybe crazy.  Sorry to take your time.

I thought it was a satellite at first but then noticed two other lights at different distances traveling with it. I stopped and continued to watch as more and more were popping up! All at different intervals and to my North East. They weren't appearing from the skyline, but instead between the stars Perseus and Cassiopeia, where the light would slowly fade in from out of nowhere. Then the light was remain stable for a few seconds before taking off East. They moved a little faster than a satellite's pace across the sky. And would fly into the same line as one another. So some lights would appear around the same time, wait, and then one by one would take off east and fly in a line. We also saw two lights appear that were very close together, and moved together across the sky without getting closer or further apart. I could almost see the light reflecting onto something! that was between them. It wasn't pitch dark between them the way it was dark on the outsides of the lights. It looked like it was a humongous ship! The distance between the lights was similar to the size of a cargo ship out a few miles off shore. These lights seemed very high up, as the lights were dimmer than the two stars around them, but bright enough to clearly see them and make out the slight details in the big one. They didn't make any noise either. I watched this for a few minutes before running inside to get my girlfriend to come out as well and she also witnessed them. We saw the giant ship together, followed by more of the single lights. This continued on for over 10 minutes before some cloud cover overhead made the lights and stars no longer visible. I tried to get video of it, but I only had my phone on me and the phone couldn't even make out the steady stars let alone the traveling lights. All that's on the video is audio of my girlfriend and I talking about w! hat we saw. Who knows how long this was happening before I saw! it, but I did not see the beginning nor the end of these mysterious UFO's/Lights flying across the sky. It looked something like a fleet arriving one by one from ""hyper space"" if you will. Like straight out of Star Wars. And it was at a steady random pace, every time I thought it was the end, I'd see a few more appear and then more! Once the cloud covered the event, I had to drive my girlfriend to the bus stop to get her bus to the city. We tried to see more on the drive but the clouds had taken up the sky. The sun then came up and haven't been able to see anything else. I contacted the FAA through an email with the same details from this report.

As I walked south on our loop taking in the amazing stars, I saw what appeared to be 2 stars moving from my left to right – they appeared to be a similar distance apart as two stars in the big dipper handle.  They were moving quite rapidly, and my initial assumption was that it was the space station but, then told myself there wouldn’t be two.  I watched for about a minute and was going to run back to the house to wake my wife to see it… as I paused, I noticed a whole stream of similar lights following in somewhat equidistant distance but in a following formation.  There were about 10 in total zooming from west to east. At this point, I ran in, woke up my wife and had her outside in less than 2 minutes hoping they were not gone… to my surprise, I saw the tail end of the original set, with a new set that were heading east in a slightly more northeast direction which were led by 4 lights and then another 6 or more trailing single file.  They all moved from west to east and disappeared from sight because of the trees – we have tall trees in the neighborhood, so I would assume my viewing angle is about 40 degrees west to east.. There were no sounds and they were quite small like the space station – I watched as an airplane passed just minutes later and I could faintly hear the jet as it passed and the jet “light” footprint was larger than the unidentified lights.  My initial thoughts… -	I am up every morning for years and have never witnessed anything like this before, though I often see aircraft and hear them since SeaTac airport is about 40 miles north of us -	There were 2 distinct sets of objects – the first moving east on a slight southerly tangent, the second which my wife also saw moving east on a slight northerly tangent -	The distance between the objects was not consistent – it appeared if one would speed up to catch another but I never saw one move past the one in front of it; they were definitely a group and they were definitely trailing each other in a very organized fashion -       They moved rapidly across the sky, similar to the international space station moves in relation to my view  We live near JBLM and our initial thought was military aircraft… but 20 or more?

At 1205Z she saw a bright light out of her peripheral vision and looked up to see a bright object, shot straight up and instantly disappeared. She continued watching the sky in the same area and saw a dimmer object, then another and another. At that time she came inside the house and told me I should go out and see the lines. I was still in bed since I've been retired for 2 years and use to sleeping in later. I quickly got dressed, slipped on slippers and was going to go outside when she came in from outside and I asked her again about the ""lines"". She confirmed there was a ""line of lights"" going across the sky and kept coming and coming. I went out to the front lawn and didn't see anything at first but she showed me where to look. Sure enough there were lots and lots of them streaming from the West going East in the Northern sky.  The sky was completely clear and dark and the Eastern sky was beginning to show signs of sunrise. At no time did I see any trails out of the objects or hear any noise. I  could not see if there were exterior lights.  These objects were lighted of medium brightness (like that of a normal satellite) and were continuous (not blinking on and off) from the time they came above the trees in the West to the time I lost sight of them in the East. Maximum elevation was about 60 degrees above the Northern horizon.  They were traveling faster than any satellite I have seen before taking about 10 seconds to traverse the sky. The interval between objects was about two thumb widths   but varied. They seemed to be in groups of say 30 objects then a longer interval of say 5 seconds or so before the next group would start across the sky. The brightness of all the objects was the same intensity.  However, at two times during the entire observation I saw one much brighter object and traveling much faster come from the West to overtake a less bright object. Then slow down to the less bright object and quickly circle around and stop for a second and then continue on at a faster speed.  In this continuous line of single objects there would be a cluster of objects frequently together in the line, like a squadron and varied in brightness a little. This went on for 20 minutes nonstop. The end came about 1225Z when my wife was just before leaving for work. I got back in the house at 1228Z.  This is the most fantastic and amazing thing I have ever witnessed in my life. I kept asking myself while viewing the objects if this was a dream or is it real. It was like something out of a Star Wars movie but live and in person.

Tuesday August 6th, I was working on my thesis for Perceptual Dimensional Frequency Bandwidths. I worked for roughly 6 hours on it, when I finished for the night, I took a late night stroll around the block to clear my head. When i was about three fourths of the way around the block, I received a perceptual message inside my head, with energy that was noticeably foreign, instigating me to look up.  When i did, passing me from behind me, about a 600 ft above me, was a squarish, diamond shaped craft, with some sort of pivoting thruster mechanism, extending from the bottom of the craft, that had a green aura of light around it.  It made no noise.  There was another craft up much further in the other part of the sky.  This one was unrecognizable, and only seen as blinking lights.  I live right next to the airport, and this occurred in the middle of a flight path.  I am sure that this was caught on Cleveland Hopkins radars, or one the respective planes radar.  When i got home that night, I went to sleep.  I didn't really know how i should have proceeded with the incidient, as I am very busy. I continue on with my life until On Thursday August 8th, I had reached a major breakthrough in my theory.  That night while I was sleeping, I woke up into sleep paralysis, with a humanoid figure, with blue scaly skin, and short horns protruding from the head, wearing some sort of tattered robe, was rummaging through my room, as I was paralyzed.  The following morning on the 8th of august, I had immediately received a telepathic message through perception, telling me to look at my work.  When i went into my work books, I had noticed 9 major pages of my theory, in which I had established a breakthrough in the previous night was missing.  I was also sent visual perceptive images of a reptilian, and some very weird emotional energy surrounding it.  I have cameras everywhere surrounding the property, and there were no intruders, or signs of forced entry.  I started to remember previous events of missing time, and a repressed memory came up from the summer of 2015, while I was living in California and I had seen a mothership out of my bedroom window, over the ocean.

August 9, 2016   Let me start by saying that I have always believed that we are not alone in this universe.  In the past year I have become more and more interested in finding out the truth and why the government is trying to keep it secret!  I had been watching a tv program called “Ancient Aliens: Declassified and “Project Blue Book”when I decided that I would watch the sky at night periodically.  I truly wasn’t optimistic about this because I figured my state would obviously have very few sightings if any at all. Two months ago, I was at my sisters house and we were outside on the porch.  I just happened to be looking at the sky between the trees when I saw bright light (I just thought was a star) and just watched for a minute or less because the light was moving then quickly shot across the sky like a flash of light.  I asked my sister if she seen it and she said no and laughed at me.  Since then I haven’t discussed what I see with anyone unless they are at least open to the fact that what I’m saying is true!   I’ve seen few more since then but hadn’t been very consistent with watching the sky.  Last night I decided to go outside with my granddaughter and look at the stars.  It was a clear night and a great night to find/see a falling star!  My granddaughter went in the open garage to play for a little while and I continued to watch the sky when I noticed that to the left of me, when I began to notice many (more than I’ve ever seen fly in at the same time)  airplanes flying towards our airport. I couldn’t to keep watching because it seemed peculiar and I wondered why.  While I was watching the sky I noticed 2 lights in the sky that almost looked like stars but I noticed that they were kind of twinkling and moving together in the same direction.  First they went right, down, then appeared to be kind of heading toward the airport, when the one I could keep track of made almost a complete circle.  We don’t have anything on Earth that could fly that fast or maneuver in that way! I could not ! make out a shape because it was to far away but the bright light and maneuvering techniques fascinated me enough to find out how to report it and who to report it to!      Thank you for listening.  I hope it wasn’t to long and drawn out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was moving extremely slowly and had 5 bright beams of light shooting out of it to a good distance and evenly spaced.  The object had a trail of what appeared to be a cloud of smoke behind it in a trail which was erratically shaped as if the object had been mobile for some time and moving from over the ocean toward land.  The trail was not straight, suggesting a non-linear path, and their was no apparent wind as the clouds were still.   Interestingly the “smoke” was lit up, very much in contrast to the clouds around it, of which there were few, so this object was not obscured by clouds.  After a couple of minutes, the object began moving more rapidly (but still very slowly) toward the earth and appeared to be naturally extinguishing itself as it got c! loser.  At this point the projections of light also dimmed and disappeared. When it got a bit over the tree line where I was, it was totally out, but the “smoke trail” behind it continued to glow as if lit up from within, light hues, not just one color but mostly bright white light.

AMAZING!!! HUGE perfect ball shaped, dull metallic gray, with a white light that appeared to wrap all the way around it- hovering  fairly close to the earth considering the size of it.  This thing was enormous!  I was getting on the 10 Freeway East at California Avenue.  As soon as I made a right onto the on-ramp I was amazed.  It was just right there hovering.  At first I thought it was the moon and was in awe of how BIG it was.  But the white light ring around it made it look like a lunar eclipse.  Once I merged on to the freeway safely I tried to get a better look.  Had to rub my eyes to make sure I was really seeing what I thought it was. It didn’t appear to be moving.  Just hovering.  After I was sure it was not an eclipse of the moon I thought to myself that maybe it was a blimp....but knew it absolutely was not- waaay too BIG, wrong shape (this was like a perfect ball). Because it was just hovering I became excited that I was going to be able to “catch up” to it for a better look.  So I glanced to my left as I got over to the fast lane of the freeway.  When I looked back again ahead of me it wasn’t gone but within a fraction of a second it wasn’t there anymore. I couldn’t believe my eyes.  I have never seen anything move that fast.... especially something that massive in size. It was just gone.....poof!  I so wish I had been able to see it up closer.  I am still in awe of what I saw.  It was amazing.  It was beautiful.  Unfortunately there was nobody in my truck with me to share the experience :(  I couldn’t even talk to other drivers because we were on the freeway at an interchange.  And when I got to where I was going (San Manuel Casino) I couldn’t find a soul who witnessed what was just up in our sky.  Yes it was so big I am certain if any of those gamblers had been outside they could have seen it all the way from the casino. When I got there I told a few  people (that I didn’t even know’) what I saw....a couple of them looked at me like I was crazy.....one guy was interested and believed me....he was jealous.  I would be, too. It was an amazing experience. PS--I didn’t hear ANY sound of an engine or motor.  And when it disappeared it was very fast but VERY smooth movements.",2019-10-04T00:00:00,34.03061421800948,-117.14975355450235

Then I saw a smaller object appear next to the original larger object.  At this point both flashing lights were quite small.  Then they both darted off.

Sighting on August 1, 2019 at 9:10 PM, approximately.  Location North of I-395 and Route 32 intersection.  I have a Snap Chat recording of the sighting. We debated sending it in.  As I was heading North on I-395, about a quarter mile before the first Montville Exit and in the general direction of the Oxoboxo River, I spotted what appeared to be the lights of an airplane in my center field of view.  Initially my head thought of a triangle ufo, not entirely sure why, due to the common red taillight and two white lights on the wings.  This changed a second later, as I noticed the red tail light was abnormally close to the two front white lights. I further noticed how close the lights were in proximity to me. This realization came to clarity when my headlights began to reveal (as I headed down the hill of the road) the defined figure of a triangle object 100 to 200 feet North and about 100 feet above the I-395.  The side bore 45 degree angled beams that combined the top of the craft with the bottom. Between the beams was a lighter silver surface enclosing the craft. The visible bottom of the craft, which appeared to have a small, carbon colored black triangle in the center, was relatively flat. There may have been small black circles on the bottom. The craft was dark grey and silver like metal but different. It wasn’t metal.  Suddenly, I noticed that about ten feet behind this craft was an exact second.  These two vessels had no propulsion devices and were not hovering like if they had a rotor like a drone or helicopter. They made no noise and moved Eastbound at about 8 miles per hour, smoother than anything I have ever seen move before. They were not tethered to one another and did not wiggle or move about as they slid through the air. It was as though they were untouched by the environment, the wind and gravity. I want to describe them as being unbound to physics by the sheer perfection in the way that they moved, with no external force to effect them.  I drove under them and caught my reaction on Snap Chat as I was fumbling to find my phone and open up the app.  I lost sight of them after that. I did not stop.  I just watched Tucker Carlson last night (the 19th) with his guest and segment of the UFO’s and the Russian Jets that were shot down.",2019-12-22T00:00:00,41.4626,-72.1309

One observer walked out of the group to the dark area and saw the weird spots appeared in the line in the sky. The observer called them to see the extra-terrestrial activity and wanted to share our experience. There appeared to be a series of objects that moved in a straight line, observed as a line of lights/objects moving up into the sky. All moved upwards at the same time, in vision, it looked like separate objects following each other. They moved upwards and as they went overheard at a certain point, they disappeared. Each light disappeared when it reached that point. Some of them moved sporadically to the left or right then below and up again before they disappeared . It took approximately the minute for them to move from horizon to directly above us when they disappeared one by one. There were many at least 25. We did not count them as we were amazed at the time and did not know what it was and did not think to record or count them until a few seconds later. We have a recording on my phone. No trial was left. This was late at night we could not see the object, only the light on each, which was the size of the head of a small nail head, approximately 1-2 mm in diameter. They all appeared white in colour. No sound was heard by people with normal hearing. There were 10 witnesses saw it. There was a clear night and half-moon beside the lights or objects as it appeared, they were very far away but before the stars and near or not far from the moon.

I was inside for about 15 seconds and returned to see the bright light about 2 miles away. Oddly enough, it was completely silent no engine noise or nothing. Just as the light was about 2 miles away it all of a sudden changed course from roughly straight south to rising into outer space with no hesitation.   The light that emitted never blinked, stopped or strobed, it just got brighter as it got closer.  It traveled straight up for about 5 seconds when I said to my friend “it’s going to disappear”.  Not a split second after that when I finished fumbling with my camera, the object did just that and faded out and was gone. I know this was not a commercial jet, satellite, balloon, drone, etc.  The size was big enough that I thought it was a jet.  It was brighter than any star right from the get go to only get brighter.  It was always the same white light and did not change color.  We later seen a couple more unexplainable strange flash bulbs but nothing like what previously happened.",2019-06-07T00:00:00,42.9314,-71.1851

Looking in the direction of the Big Dipper, I saw a bright orange single light, about as bright as Jupiter or the brightest stars, just come into being out of nowhere.  There was no sound, no smoke trail, nothing to suggest this was an aircraft of known type.  This thing appeared to be really high, like tens of thousands of feet high, and really bright orange-red.  It moved slowly, much too slowly for a meteor, in kind of a wavy ""s-shaped"" pattern.  It made a soft curve and flew right through the bowl of the big dipper, then started to fade in intensity slowly over about 3 to 5 seconds until it was completely gone. People see these things all the time up here, operating at night in the wee hours of the morning in secluded places.  We call them ""movers"".  I personally see them at least once every two years.  They are always single star-like lights, very bright, moving in curved paths, moving silently with no wings or vapor trail.  I've been seeing them in these mountains since I was a teen age, and they are not satellites, I know what a satellite looks like.  These things are way too slow, follow curvy paths, and seem to come in from space and then go back out to space within half a minute or so.  I've seen them seem to notice when they are being observed, and I've seen them fly in to clouds for cover.  I sure would like to figure out what these things are, they are too dim to film with an iPhone camera. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Driving from Canyon Village to Norris Junction, Yellowstone National Park, I saw a bright light, brighter than the stars, moving steadily low on the horizon.  No flashing lights.  Larger diameter than a star.  Did not fade like a satellite.  Had time to try three cameras, filmed it with my most low light camera so you can just see the shadows of trees it is passing behind, as it blinks, obscured by successive trees.  Sometimes you can see stars for comparison.  This isn't the first time I've seen something like this around here.  It's the first time I've filmed it.  Sorry for the blob of text, I just filmed it.  Also seemed like a more random path than a satellite.  I filmed a grizzly wslking the road 15 minutes before, in the dark, 10 miles away.  During filming yhe UFO, Which seemed closer than a satellite, I smelled a strong, musky odor, possibly elk.  Still, it was a bit much with all that's happened, so if you find fault with the report, remember I just! filmed a full adult grizzly tens of yards from my vehicle unexpectedly (I stayed in my vehicle to film the bear), filmed the UFO from outside my vehicle, bright circle, larger than a star, closer.  Closer than most other phenomenon I've seen like this.  I've not had a close encounter, closer than this anyway.  White to yellow white.  Brighter than Venus, which is unusually bright due to altitude here anyway.  Please excuse any typos.  I'm used to reporting bollides, I drive a lot at night and have seen many more than most.  This was not a bollide.  I also drive very long distances at night, that's why I've seen so many.  It's dark, clear, no moon, but I would guess I was in the vicinity of the wolf Lake pullout.  I'm not ruling out unknown Earth craft.  No sound, slthough I didn't turn off the radio during filming.  Since I write z lot I can compose this quickly, though it's blob form, normally I write longhand.  It might not have bern as straight a line as a satellite, an! d didn't change in brightness like a reflecting satellitr.  Si! nce I wa s filming, I couldn't tell if it turned slightly, and it was obscured by treetops sometimes.  It wasn't accelerating, however at thst distance, it was probably fast.  When I smelled the strong odor, I walked closer to my car immediately, just in case.  Stronger than most animal odors in the woods, even those I attribute, rightly or wrongly to elk.  Strong musky odor. This is the first one that's stayed in view long enough to film.  Normally see them just after twilight.  This video camera isn't a night video csmera, so it was at the limit of it's capabilities to film the light and faint tree shadows.  Most coulfn't with this setup, I know how, even then, sometimes the camera won't allow these settings for some reason.  Tonight it did.  Usually I submit bollide reports immediately, so I'm sending this right away.  It was moving East along the northern treeline, I'm tired, best I can figure.  With time, as it passed, I figured out how to film it better.  Seen these before, not! this bright, best I've seen, not blinding light by any mesns, brighter than a plane that distsnce, and no flashing lights.

The road I travel is straight , s curve, then straight again for about 8 miles before another s curve then straight four about for miles to town.  I had just went around the first s curve and was getting into the straight part of the road, when I noticed tail lights in front of me.  Thinking nothing of it I watch as they went around the s curve about seven miles ahead of me.  As soon as the tail lights were out of sight two bright lights “ clicked” on in the sky about where the turn was.  I remember thinking that’s weird I don’t remember seeing a plane.  It was odd enough I kept an eye on it as I was driving.  After about a mile or so I thought ‘ why isn’t it blinking like a plane’?  My next thought was maybe it was a helicopter with spot lights.  After about four- five miles of watching this thing I began to get creeped out because it wasn’t moving.  At about two miles I realized I wasn’t looking at a helicopter, but a U.F.O. . The object looked like a pair of glasses in the way that it was two orbs connected and overlapped by a bar of light.  The whole thing I could see was uniform in color.  The tips of the wings were about to the far sides of the ditches with orbs being roughly the size of the lanes on the roads.  If I had to guess how think it was I would say  12-15 feet across the orbs.  The object was about 300-400 hundred feet above the road.  At this point I was freaking out and grabbed a weapon (unsure what effect it might have had) from my back seat.  Now less then a mile away and having to drive under It not though it, it started to pulse a very light pink color just on the iner sides of the orbs.  Now I was about to go under i looked up a saw no real “parts” just a black void behind the white orbs and bar. I was able the see it had a triangle shape to it. A couple of observations I made were that it didn’t reflect light off the ground or my truck and it didn’t seem to make any noise as I was gong under it.  Now under it I opened my sunroof and the object was gone!  After that I went home had a beer n went to bed. The next morning I woke up feeling a bit sick so drove into work early.  On my way to work I received a text from my wife.  This is extra weird.  She was apologizing for the rough sleep due to her dreams.  No kidding.  Her message was along the lines of “ I was dreaming we were in a camper driving and aliens were fighting in the sky around us!  I had to pull over and read the message again.  Now not wanting to put any ideas in her head about what I saw I told her I seen something weird last night.  At work I made it a half hour and was sicker the shit so had to leave.  Once my wife came home from work I asked her to describe what she saw in her dream.  What she described was two triangle shaped crafts the had dislodged their orbs to fight each other.

I live in Shoreline, Washington, (North of Seattle). I’m married with one child, he’s 4. I am a career Journey-person in Machine Repair. I have a solid foundation in sights in the sky as I am an avid sky watcher, but mainly for aircraft and when weather is clear, stars, satellites and the I.S.S.. I work for Boeing in the 737 MAX factory down in Renton, yes, it’s a tough time….I’m not here to discus MAX issues, all apologies.  But what I and my family witnessed tonight, I have to get out there.  Full disclosure: I am a believer in life outside of humanity, the universe is too big to believe otherwise. I also have had 2 prior UAP sightings. One, in Michigan driving south on 127 from Lansing to Jackson, was significant (to me) as I witnessed a bright light pulsating between green and blue, watched for several minutes then it accelerated to, what I can only estimate, about 1,800 to 2,100 MPH at maybe a 70-80 degree angle perpendicular to the horizon. It was interesting. I texted my future wife and told her “I saw a UFO”. She was and is a skeptic. I’m ok with that.  Fast forward 9 years to tonight, January 28th, 2020. Look, I am being so talkative because I want you and everyone to know I’m just a normal guy who loves RC crawlers, airplanes/spacecraft, the stars…maybe I’m trying to hard. I don’t know. Either way, here was the sighting from tonight:  I went out to take the trash out. Normal Tuesday night routine. As always, if I get a chance to look up I do. I have seen our (Boeing’s) 747 Dream Lifter lining up to land at Paine Field in Everett WA 4 times now since we moved to the Seattle area, and it’s a beautiful bird! Anyway tonight it is partly cloudy, I notice the clouds are fairly fast moving, traversing to the north at many MPH. Fast enough that it makes the stars breaking through look as if they are moving to the South. As I stated before I have seen satellites and the I.S.S. and am familiar with civilian passenger aircraft flying at 40,000 (or so) feet…they have navigation beacons and strobe lights to identify direction of travel and weather they are above or below you. But what I saw next baffled me at first.  I saw a satellite. I “knew” this because the “dot”/“point of light” was larger than a star and traversing on a west to east trajectory. I “knew” it was a satellite for about 2-3 seconds, it went behind a cloud….and then another “satellite” appeared in the same spot the other one had from behind a cloud traveling in the same direction. My senses perked up. For the next minute I watched several more “satellites” traverse the same section of sky, some were in loose formation, not military precision type formation, but two offset with one trailing back as if it was part of a delta formation. I thought about trying to take a video or pic with my iPhone but knew this wouldn’t work. Next best option, I ran to the front door and said (with enough “worry” in my voice as I dare) “Babe, can you come look at this? I want you to see it!” My wife, probably thinking the worst: crashed car, somebody in danger….she is a Neonatal Nurse Practitioner after all, she quickly grabbed shoes and cak! e outside. Our son was curious too at the excitement so I picked him up and carried him out. I pointed up and said I saw something flying between the clouds. And to my delight, and with no more suggestive descriptions, the lights kept traversing cloud breaks. I asked my wife, “did you see that?” Wife, “all I see is an airplane” I explained what I saw before alerting her and almost on cue, two more traversed in again, a loose formation, and she said “yea those are really close” At this point I’m really trying hard to NOT use terms like UFO or Aliens!!! Cuz well, skeptics. She knows I know airplanes, she knows I can point out a satellite or the rare ISS transit. I pointed out how the direction the”lights” were traveling was perpendicular to cloud/star travel. Faster. And also no Nav lights…at all. She said “We live close to a military base” She is correct, Whidbey Naval Air base to the West and Louise McChord to the way south. I agreed with her, could be military…. Yet I poin! ted out that the “objects” never came back out from behind the! cloud t hat obscured them. While we were watching, a passenger airliner passed behind that same cloud heading north, Nav lights and all, then reappeared in the same general cloud break we saw the “lights” in. I said “see, that’s an airplane, and it did exactly what it should do, blink and strobe, go behind clouds and cone out on the other side”  My son was begging to go back in uninterested, again I was NOT using suggestive language, and my wife said she needed to go to the grocery store before she could get our son to bed so I could sleep as well. While she was gone I went back out to observe. I saw to more airliners traveling north, one more object as the previous but it looked as though it was traveling west to east on a more northern trek. And then about 6-7 minutes later one more “object” that was traveling same direction as the others, but I only saw it briefly.  When my wife returned, I didn’t want to freak her out, or if she was, perpetuate the fear. I told her “I know what we saw” she gave me the ‘look’. I said “it wasn’t a UFO” she looked at me and said “no?” “No babe, those were UAP’s” again a question look. “Unidentifiable Aerial Phenomenon, we don’t know WHAT those were” She accepted, to my surprise.  Again, I’m not here to spread some outlandish “experience”, I’m a normal dude, father, husband and Precision Machine Repair-person…just wanted to get this down and out there while it was fresh in my mind!",2020-01-31T00:00:00,,

Ventura California, November 27, 2019 at approximately 2:45am witnessed a large flat light come down vertically to ground, the entire night sky became very bright almost white, the lights in the house started flickering with like a power surge, electrical surge., then it was gone.  Entire event took no more than 15 seconds I live on the hillside in Ventura, California, so my view is all the way from the hillside to the Conejo Grade (101 Frwy), out to Pt Mugu, the Santa Clara Islands and all the way up to Santa Barbara. On Nov 27th around 2:45 am I was in my Living room with my son when this light appeared. The light, rather flat beam came down vertically it looked like a very wide flat beam of light. The beam covered quite a large area; I would say half up to the entire length of the runway at the airport. When the tight touched the ground (within a few seconds) the entire night sky lit up brighter than anything I have ever seen. It was very white and bright. My son was facing the window, I had my back to the window and noticed the room light up, so I turned and saw this huge, wide flat beam of light from the sky to the ground over the Camarillo Airport. The light became very bright almost white, then the lights in the house started flickering and surging. At that time, I turned away from the light and looked down my hall to see if the house was shaking, thinking that it might have been a earthquake. Frankly I am very surprised it didn’t blow the power, or at least the transformers, because you could tell that the surge was not a normal flicker lights power outage kind of event. Something was taxing the power. The entire event lasted less than 15 seconds. There was no sound from this at all. The sky was cloudy with rain, so when we went outside to look up there was nothing that we could see because of the cloud cover. The light was so bright, and it must have covered a good 10 – 15-mile radius. My son felt like the light was maybe from an explosion or bomb, and in fact for a split second felt as if the windows would blow out, but there was no sound. No thunder and lighting, no explosion, nothing, completely silent. At that point we waited to see if there were any police or fire department lighted cars or trucks going in the direction of the airport nothing. Got on social media (twitter, Instagram), to see if anyone saw it….nothing. turned on the local news ….nothing. Our cat was completely puffed up, as he does when he sense’s danger, or another animal around. As I type this a good 24 hours have passed, and we have not found anyone besides my son who saw this, which is even more baffling.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,34.29657455830389,-119.23991625441697

At 9:40pm looking directly over the North Carolina ocean on a clear night with a half moon, we saw first one, then 2, deep orange glowing orbs over the ocean at an angle of 30 degrees.  On this night, that means these lights appeared stationary, halfway between the ocean horizon and the half moon.  From Ocean Isle Beach, 30 degrees into the sky and almost straight out into the ocean, but more like 20 degrees to the right/south.  Which was almost directly under the half moon at this time on this date. 3 nights prior, my brother and I saw a green fireball (meteor I assume) Bright green and going straight down into the water, directly straight over the ocean (probably burning up prior to hitting).  This night was another clear night and I was on the beachfront deck with 3 others: My wife, my friend, and my sister.  All 4 of us witnessed the event: brief but long enough for everyone to turn their heads and witness enough of it (both lights). The event itself: 1 deep orange stationary light appeared in the sky. It was about the overall luminosity of the half moon in the sky, so quite bright.  More of an orb than a small point.  Since we were spotting meteors, I yelled to look at that one coming right at us.  (Thinking it was a large fireball headed directly at us since it appeared stationary.)  But then it lasted too long and didn't move, and then started going out exactly as a 2nd one started glowing. Briefly this was like 2 orange headlights in the sky coming at us.  As a guess, it seemed like 3 miles out over the open ocean at a 30 degree angle into the sky off the horizon.  No boats in the area (some to the distant left and right), and no planes in the sky, at least none anywhere to be seen with lights on them.  Visibility was strong, with the milky way band of stars visible directly overhead despite the half moon. The 2 orange lights only lasted about 15 seconds and each appeared stationary, and locked, horizontal to each other.  Based on the distance away they appeared like they were 1/10 of a mile apart in the sky.  The first light lasted 6 seconds, then started to fade concurrent with an equal and opposite brightening of the 2nd light to the right of the first light.  Then the original light was gone and the light to the right was on, for about 5 additional seconds, then both were gone.  They came on and off but didn't move otherwise. I went online to see if this is common in NC, and it's ultra common over the last 20 years.  Lots of people seeing this type of thing and not a lot of good theories.  But this video from 6 months prior seems to show exactly what the 4 of us witnessed:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkUs79K940E   Closest guess would be military exercises, flares on parachutes.  But the lack of planes and the lack of smoke trails and any movement at all are an issue.  Also, some other events seem to last longer, this one was rather fast and not useful for flares unless they failed somehow.  Kind of a Chinese lantern glow but it was super windy that day and there was no movement, and we were watching the sky all night for meteors and I'm not sure how they could get out over the ocean and only ignite themselves briefly like that.  The shutting off of the one on the left and concurrent turning on of a new one on the right make it 10x more eerie than if it was just one odd light, because it seemed like it could signify intelligent intent - which could of course be a coincidence. When filing these reports does anyone get back to you to say what it was, or to see if they can confirm if there were military exercises off the coast of NC that night?  In the above similar event video online, it was in December and on a Tuesday rather than a Thursday night, but they said it happened ""between 9 and 10 pm"" which was a match, also a match in terms of appearing out in the ocean and slightly to the right.  Though above video appears like a 20 degree angle and our event was a bit higher in the sky. Just after and seemingly unrelated, way to the left/north up the coast was a very distant storm cloud with frequent lightning within the cloud, looking like stranger things type movie effect.  Visible lighting but eerie, and all within 1 cloud.  Very distant though and to the left rather than straight/right, where there were no clouds, boats or planes.  Though I guess that means some sort of exotic orange ball lighting could an angle.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,33.9259,-78.4498

Tonight, I saw an aircraft I first thought was an airliner on the SeaTac glideslope, but it was kind of odd.  It had one bright white light that strobed (like two blinks, pause, two blinks), a solid white light, and a fainter solid red light.  They didn't look particularly unusual for aircraft lights, just in a configuration I've never noticed before.  I can't even say that description of the lights is completely accurate - I was driving, and assuming it was just an airplane, not paying that close attention - but something along those lines. After a few minutes, I realized it wasn't an airliner, it was hovering at a few hundred feet just west of the highway.  I assumed it was a helicopter.  I glanced up at it as I passed, and nope, it was a perfect dark grey or black triangle, with the lights at the tips.

My story is a long one so brace yourself... It started with my wall in the bedroom pushing inward like a distorted bubble I started filming it and was completely freaked out, I sent the video shortly after by email to a couple people but they said they didn't receive them.  Then later that evening there was a fog like mist in my home that had something floating in the air I was baffled and called the maintenance guy to come and check things out but he had no explanation.  The next night is when I actually saw the craft and them!  A friend of mine came to stay over and while she was asleep I noticed the fog again, next thing I know my dog runs in freaked out then ran back outside I was baffled so I went out looking for her and that's when it happened I opened the sliding glass door there were 5 large ones out there and their craft was overhead.  It looked almost like a giant pinkish jelly fish.  I apparently startled them, because I could see them, the one closest to me was at first maybe 4 feet tall and then it quickly stood up or could make itself grow to 6 foot.  It came right up to me there were 2 others holding my dog and 2 more standing out in my lawn.  I quickly grab the closest thing I could which happened to be a broom and I went out to chase them to get them to let go of my dog, but they weren't alone, they had what I can only assume is their version of pets because a small one jumped on my dog and guided her/road her over to the gate and under it.  Just as fast as I ran out there to beat'em with the broom they disappeared.  I ran back in the house and went to wake my friend but got the scare of my life I ran down the hallway rounded the corner to the bedroom, yelling to my friend ""they took my dog we have to go get her"" and then there one stood.  I was startled and it also seemed startled and surprised that I could see it, it moved quickly into the bathroom I chased after it and there were 3 more in the shower ALSO shocked that I could see them, then poof they were g! one. The room were my friend was sleeping was filled with that fog like substance, it was filled with what looked like animal hair with what I can only describe as long pieces of murky colored confetti, it was very strange. I'm not sure for what reason why they seemed surprised I could see them the only thing I can ""assume"" is that breathing that stuff in and/or getting it in your eyes that you can't see them...I wear contacts and had been using eye drops from the first time that I noticed that foggy gunk because it messed with my contacts. I don't know how long my friend had been breathing that stuff but she didn't see anything.  And of course they had cloaked themselves after the knew I saw them. So my friend, being the best friend she can, drove me around looking for my dog.  I think she thought I was losing it cause she wouldn't let me drive. LOL As we drove around I saw several of the little ones at different peoples houses around the neighborhood, my friend couldn't see them, course she was driving and probably mad cause it was around 2 A.M.  We didn't spot my dog anywhere so we finally went back to the house it was probably around 3 A.M.  I was trying to explain everything that had happened but she didn't believe me and that it was ""All in my head"". So now I'm finally winding down (with the lights and T.V. ON!) I saw movement on the wall in front of my bed... Imagine any science fiction movie you've seen out there where someone has the ability to ""go invisible"" for movie reasons, so we the audience, can see where they are going we would see the ripple effect.  Take Harry Potter movies for instance he had the ""cloak of invisibility"" but we as the audience could see him, that's the movement I saw coming towards me from the wall.  I actually reached my hand out to touch it when it finally came up next to the bed.  This was not like the ones I had seen earlier it was more like a lion type e.t.  This one actually calmed me for some reason I wasn't afraid of it I could feel the the hair and whiskers on it and even feel it breathing. Needless to say my friend was out cold and I watch one hovering over her putting it's nose up close to hers and then these little feelers came out of its nose and were touching her face.  I did try to tell her what I was seeing but she just said ""Uh huh okay"" and right back to sleep. Since November they have been here and still are, it was hell for a couple of months because there were several of them here I could not go in any part of my home without seeing their cloaked silhouette.  Night time was the worst because there were several in my bedroom hovering over my bed for weeks I was tormented by them.  I tried everything I could think of to get them to leave but they wouldn't.  I felt so alone cause I couldn't tell my friends or family cause they'd all think I was nuts!  So I suffered alone for a couple of months, it really sucked.  They are still here just not as many.  I decided to go ahead and tell my story this way because I'm not able to share it with the people I love. These E.T.'s aren't from up above like one would think they are from deep within our planet.  They are all cat like in some way, only the large ones they have a cat like head but walk upright like humans.  They have this strange type outer ""hair"" that is almost like an automatic car wash brush when it's not moving that hangs off of them.  They have the ability to erase videos and manipulate them.  Before all my videos were erased I was able to show my friend one, the very first one I took, and half way through it there was this God awful screeching noise that gave me the most horrible pain in my head.  I actually ended up going to the hospital the pain was so bad.  Later that evening all but one of my videos were erased somehow.  I didn't find that one until a few days later I had a follow up doctors appointment and showed it to him.  You could see eyes looking back at me through my sliding glass door eye level with me.  Later when I got home the video was gone!!  So that's my story, at least my doctor tells me ""he believes me"" even if no one else does.  I learned pretty quick that my friends and family are not people you can talk to about this kind of stuff.  A couple of weeks ago my son and grandbaby came over and even with him feeling something pushing down on his shoulders he asked if there was something magnetic over where he was standing.  I said, ""No you want me to say what I think it is?"" and I got the look and then the ""Mom don't go there cause if you aren't okay to watch her I'll take her home""  I just replied with ""well just saying some strange things happen around here.""  I am a firm believer we are not alone I still have aliens popping in when every they want I can't stop them.  But I have learned more about them over the last few months so I guess that's a good thing...maybe??",2019-06-20T00:00:00,46.41000733944954,-118.9094880733945

I saw all of this without a telescope, unaided with my own eyes.  The object that was expelled was also red, then dropped straight down & disappeared.  It is visible on my Apple I phone.

While I was accessing my Wendy’s app for coupons, she said, “Grandma what are those things up there?” I looked out my right passenger window and looked up. Above and around the very tall cell tower behind Wendy’s were what seemed like hundreds of round blobs moving all around but they stayed in the same area. We got out the car for a better look. They seemed clear or silver colored, but shiny. Some turned red and some turned blue. A few even changed shape to have a tail or something pointing behind, or in front. of them. They were not up very high in the sky, at least no further than the cell tower. They were definitely round before shifting shape. We tried to capture videos from my cell phone, but when we looked through the camera you could not see them. (After we got home I checked the videos on my phone and you coul! d make out a few of the objects.) After about 20 minutes, the group of objects moved to the right of the sky but at the same height level. They seemed to just disappear after that.

It was almost like when you blow out a bunch of bubbles at one time (but many more) except bubbles do not stay at one level, they either float up and then burst or fall down and burst or touch each other and burst or cling to each other and then burst.

I thought it was the sun and maybe there were ice crystals in the atmosphere diffracting the light making the very unusual image.  Then I looked around the solid part of the windshield and noticed the actual sun shinning further south.  It was close to the disk.  I really don't know how far away it was. The disk did not move or change.  It held its perfectly disk-like shape for several minutes.  I asked the girls to look at the disk and the sun, making sure that my mind wasn't playing tricks on me.  They both saw the same thing.

This sighting is from the leeward coast on a clear beautiful evening where stars are easily seen and I am familiar with the night sky, know constellations, stars, planet locations ,etc. use astronomical telescopes, frequently see satellites passing over and local commercial and military aircraft are common here on Oahu.  I was looking North East in the direction of Ursa Major handle pointing to Spica in Auriga when I saw a satellite passing Northeast.  It or something else nearby winked a bright light and went out, just one flash.  This was at satellite distance.  I did not see the satellite again.  Seconds after a gray 5-10 foot sphere much closer maybe 500 feet above moved right over my property towards ocean West in direction of Kauai over the ocean.  It was absolutely silent and was not a normal drone with wings, propellers.  It was not hovering but moving in a straight line and in 2-3 seconds was gone.  Its path was geometric and resolute as if moving on line of force not being driven by an airfoil. Unusual.  Most military operations and civilian aircraft are offshore and helicopters that pass overhead are noisy of course.  This object was not a bird like a frigate which soar over the area sometimes.  Satellites as they move overhead often change their light because they are rotating in the light of the sun.  I have many times seen them wink a bright light, whether this is due to the sun or is intentional light semaphore being used is equivocal.  The sphere may have been coincidental and was an unusual ""drone"".  Worth reporting to your database. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We live one block from the beach in Fort Lauderdale.  There are multiple ways to go home but it was such a beautiful night we decided to walk along the beach last night.  My daughter saw a VERY BRIGHT STAR (as we were walking north towards our home).  My sister jokes that it’s not a star but a planet. We saw another similar looking star not far away start to move -?we assumed it was a plane because we are about 20 minutes from the airport. However the airport is South of us & remember we are headed north.  No big deal at the moment... then the bright star began to move we thought it was our imagination so kept walking home.  My sister has a headache so we rushed back to our condo because friends were coming to meet us by the beach.  As I was coming out of my bathroom my sister screamed that as our friends were walking along the beach to us (2 miles south) they captured glowing flying objects in the! sky - our friend happens to believe in aliens & UFOs.  All of us do, however we didn’t assume that’s what they were at first.  We went back to the beach out of curiosity. All 3 of us climbed into a life guard stand facing the ocean to get a better look - sure enough we saw the flying glowing wings objects overhead.  One few over us and we could clearly see 3 lights in a triangle formation.  The lights looked read from a distance (almost like a ball of fire that has been contained).  They seemed to communicate with us on the ground & to each other through these lights.  The strange thing is that none of these large objects made any sound - we have the Airshow every April in Ft Lauderdale & it is extremely loud & noisy.  Furthermore, one object would stop & literallyvresemble a very bright star then wait for a few more to meet up & move together in unison.  No matter how many of these objects were in the sky at once... we watch from my balcony facing the intercostal an hour later - ! they never crossed paths. We took 5 videos on social media sho! wing pro of of these lights .  I watched other videos on YouTube & various news sources from others.  They look EXACTLY the same as ours.  This went in for 3 hours. Then we noticed they appeared to be landing behind the Las Olas bridge one after another. I would say without exaggeration at least 25-30 kept waiting them disappear and another one would show up. The oddest thing was before we left the beach there was a silent one that started water skiing it was also silent but had the 3 lights & it changed shape.  Since all we had were street lights... I could see waves follow it however it was completely quiet. Nobody water skis with only 3 small lights at 11pm.  That isvwhen they sharks come out. We know what we saw...  it was exhilarating yet mysterious.  We didn’t feel that there was any harm meant for us.  Now with all these other sightings world wide I would like some answers please & Thabk You for reading my report if you made it this far.

While I watched there was a rocket docking and undocking by it's self, all alone in the mid air.  The whole vehicle was painted a beautiful white and I saw a force field all around it, like it could disappear suddenly.

My horse and I did not stay long,  I felt like they could hurt us if they wanted too. 1963 Third Sighting - 3pm I came from Movie Flat RD and over a small cliff across to Mt Whitney RD and then into a creek to cool my horse's hoofs down.  It was then that I came upon some figures, there was at least ten of them about 3 to 4 feet; dressed in white suits.  I heard a strange sound among them like communication.  None of them looked at me, but they wanted to.  They were single file, behind one another and one turned and looked at me while they were walking along the creek like a tour group and began to go between the bushes and the creek.  I felt a very strong disapproval from the men so I struggled to leave on my horse.  However I felt like we were caught by something and doom was overcoming me, when my horse was able to break free and charge off with me on his back.  On the way home a fear followed me for almost 4 miles to my house.  I drew my mom a picture of the men; three or four feet tall wearing white suits with big eyes and head.

Here are the details:  Date:  Mid-August, 1969  Location:  Westport Mass., Brayton Point Road on the eastern side of the southern end near the ocean,  Time: Mid to late afternoon (15:00-17:00)   Friends and I were in the back yard of a home on Brayton Point Road directly on the water facing east.   For no reason, I happened to look into the sky in that direction and saw bright lights in a “V” formation over the water in the proximity of Mummy Rock- a rock formation in the water that resembles a reposed mummy.  There were six lights suspended in the air.  It wasn’t a plane because it didn’t move.  It wasn’t the Concorde jet because there was no sound.  They were not as high as the clouds.  They did not move and in a few seconds, they disappeared randomly, one by one, into thin air.  I looked over at my friends who were busy talking and facing in the opposite direction.  I could tell they didn’t see it.  I couldn’t talk and was too afraid to say anything.  To this day I never have. I would like to know if there’s a way to find out if anyone has ever reported this.  Thank you.",2019-07-25T00:00:00,,
6 CIRCULAR LIGHTS SLOWLY MOVE ACROSS THE TEXAS HILL COUNTRY SKY; THEN SLOWLY FLICKER OUT,Lago Vista,TX,2019-11-27T18:31:00,light,3 minutes,"Occurred : 11/27/2019 18:31  (Entered as : 11/27/19 18:31) Reported: 11/28/2019 8:30:38 PM 20:30 Posted: 12/1/2019 Location: Lago Vista, TX Shape: Light Duration:3 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/151/S151149.html,"6 CIRCULAR LIGHTS SLOWLY MOVE ACROSS THE TEXAS HILL COUNTRY SKY; THEN SLOWLY FLICKER OUT LOCATION  I live in the hill country which extends within the northwest quadrant of Travis County, Texas at an elevation of 1100 feet above M.S.L. Some of the hills immediately to the west of my home reach 1300+ feet. This location is relevant to my subject report because when the wind is from the south, my home is within 1 mile of a flight path before it enters into its southern bound final leg into Austin Bergstrom International Airport (ABIA). In other words, aircraft is relatively low as they descend over my area of the hill country.  ABIA’s air traffic has increased substantially the past 5 years. With southerly winds present on a clear night and from dusk to midnight, one may sometimes see the landing lights of up to 4 east bound descending ABIA flights that are lined up to the west of our town before passing overhead.  SIGHTING EVENT  At 6:31 pm, 23rd day of November, 2019, I stepped onto my back porch to relieve my dog. My porch faces west, so when I go outside I always glance to the west horizon to view flights approaching Austin. This night was overcast with a cloud deck at about 2000 feet, however. I knew then that flights would be obscured by the low clouds and, moreover, a cold front had passed through our area earlier in that morning. This wind shift from the north means that flights would be approaching ABIA from southern Travis County, Texas.  Nevertheless, I was astonished when I saw 6 bright lights in a line about 15 degrees above the horizon and estimated at no more than 4 miles to the west. The soundless lights were situated in the sky whereby they would be close to the area of approaching east bound ABIA flights. I immediately omitted aircraft landing lights due to the weather conditions mentioned above. My first impression was that flares had just been dropped but I did not hear aircraft, nor were the lights making a descent. Instead, they moved  very slowly to the south in a horizontal direction.  As I watched in amazement for about 60 seconds, 2 of these lights began to flicker out, then reappear after which the outer lights began to flicker out. Another 30 seconds had elapsed while viewing the remaining 4 lights in which event I decided to close my jaw dropping mouth and pull my phone out of my pocket to start a video.  VIDEO SEQUENCE  Please bear in mind that my life indulgences exclude social media and texting all day; nor do I use more than 2 apps on my phone. I seldom keep my phone on my person when at home, but this time I was lucky to have done so. I am deeply upset, however, that the video is shaky and poorly documented. The lights are not moving rapidly, but rather my excited hand. The noise is partly north winds and mostly noise from a nearby busy road.  After fumbling with my phone to retrieve my camera app, now 30 seconds more had elapsed before I started my 3 minute video. Upon such start, only 2 lights now remained. By this time, the remaining lights had traveled behind the T-Braces on top of a telephone pole. I quickly moved to another higher location in frames 1-15. Midway through frame 17, I am able to video the two remaining lights before the first disappears, then last light goes out by frame 30. I continue to zoom the sky again when 1 light reappears in frame 55 and snuffs out in frame 59. I scanned the overcast sky for another 2 minutes with no avail. Only regrets that I am bad cameraman.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,30.4602,-97.9883

It looked somewhere northwest over Oceanside, CA. Hard to tell exactly where. I was in the Emerald/College area of Oceanside, so this was maybe over the San Luis Rey Mission area, for my best guess.  The weather conditions were pre/mid storm. There had been some rain this morning and I could see rain coming down in the sunlight over to the east, so I knew there’d most likely be a rainbow. I went outside to look to the west, where there were dark clouds, and could see the rainbow out west over the ocean. As I’m viewing it, some movement catches my eye, just a little more northwest. I can see three lights moving around in very odd and fluid ways. One almost seemed to do a circle or a loop. The others were kind of moving side to side or up and down. None of this was in a rigid type way like what I’ve seen with drones. All movement was very smooth and fluid.  I’m watching these three lights, and my dad was seeing it as well, agreeing it was very odd, and he had no idea what it might be as well. The lights would hover, and at times would fade or dim, and it was hard to track them, as the sky was grey, and they’d kind of fade into the grey. I’m able to see the three lights again, but all of a sudden they just went into formation. The three lights all went into a horizontal row, and two more lights suddenly appeared in this formation. So there were five lights in a row. At times it appeared there could be up to eight lights in a row at times. All moving as if they were one object, kind of up and down or left to right at times, or just hover. This is when the lights would fade out a lot more, then get brighter, and I was having more of a hard time tracking them, or telling exactly how many there were. Sometimes it would seem like more lights would appear, or sometimes change order in this formation.  Eventually after watching what would appear to be a “stereotypical” UFO (a row of multiple lights, not moving in any way I’ve ever seen a plane, helicopter, or drone move) for about a minute, it just disappeared. I didn’t see it zoom off or anything. It’s almost as if it just went invisible.  The weather is now a pretty strong storm, with heavy rains, and I have been hearing thunder. Lightning is expected for this storm as well.

As I looked in different directions and noticed them everywhere I felt as if there was some kind of invasion.  I called 2 different people with 10 miles and they didn’t see anything.  Also took photo of stationary one but it just turns up at a glowing dot almost looks like a star, so the picture doesn’t do it justice.

Tried to match craft with local planes or possible known satellites that were currently in nearby skies but to no avail. (Following phone apps were used for this: Air Traffic, Flight Aware, Flight Radar 24 (w/Silver Membership) Satellite AR and Heaven's Above). It should also be noted that the Palm Springs airport and air museum is nearby, and being avid sky watchers, the observers have become accustomed to the typical air traffic associated with each.  This was something very different from anything that might be usually seen and did not match any reported callsigns or known aircraft.  Observers regularly use the mentioned phone apps to match aircraft they see to that which is reported and passing nearby or through the airport. Traveling westbound via car on 10 Freeway, exited on Indian Canyon to turn into the North Palm Springs Motel 6 parking lot.  Passenger spotted and pointed out to driver a shiney, silvery-white, disk shaped, wingless craft ascending in the Eastern sky, directly out past the windmill fields.  The center of disk was raised enough to be where this would be where it seems like a pilot could reside.  No sound could be heard, though if it were a plane, the associated sound could have been heard. Sky was perfectly clear, winds the night before had been very gusty and might have kicked up sand but at this time all dusts had settled and only a very slight breeze existed. Spotted at about 60 degrees - the horizon being 0.  At first the craft seemed to climb slowly and steadily in elevation similar to any typical passenger plane, but after about 30 seconds of us observing this, the craft seemed to come to a hovering hold.  What appeared to be doors folded out from under the craft and then back up into it.  The craft then started ascending, up and away, amazingly fast, straight up into the atmosphere; within a matter of seconds, it shrunk from view until it completely disappeared.  No trails were left behind. ((ADDENDUM SUBMITTED BY WITNESS)) Good evening Mr. Davenport, I just wanted to let you know that I got your voicemail about my report and I thank you for taking the time to look over it.  I just wanted to let you know though, that the time I initially reported is the correct time - 10:00AM; I know that might seem a bit unusual, as most reports seem to reference the night, but I have come to notice that there's just as much interesting activity going on in our sky during the day as there is during the night.  Also, there was no evidence of anything left behind, but that's likely due to the elevation of the object and that from its initially high elevation, it only zipped away, higher and higher until vanishing. I'd be happy to answer any other questions you might have. Thank you again, ((END ADDENDUM))",2019-08-23T00:00:00,,

On the evening of 3 June, 2019, 3 adults, a 10-year old and a 6-year old observed 4 craft hover and maneuver over the town of Patagonia, Arizona, for 2 hours. The evening was dark (new moon), no haze and cloudless.  You could see the streak of the Milky Way arcing through the sky. The sighting started at around 2030, my Mom and I were sitting in the back yard talking.  All of a sudden, my Mom exclaimed, ""Look at that Airliner!""  I turned, and looking east-southeast towards Red Mountain, was a light traversing from left to right, about 30-degrees above the horizon.  At first glance, it would be easily be mistaken for an aircraft strobe...but the flash pattern was too fast, almost flickering.  As we looked, the craft slowed, stopped, and then started moving the exact opposite direction.  I ran to the fence, and as I watched, it slowed and started hovering. Perfectly motionless.  I called my Mom to go get my Cousins and to bring binoculars. About 30 seconds later, she arrived at the fence with my Older cousin, her two kids, aged 10 and 6, and the binoculars. Looking through the binoculars, I observed a large red ball-like light on the right with two flickering/strobing lights to left.  While I was looking, the ball changed color from red to blue, and started moving straight up.  All of us exclaimed in amazement.  After moving up for 5 seconds, it moved left, stopped and hovered, and then started moving in random motions, frequently stopping to hover motionlessly for up to 30 seconds at a time. At this time, my 10-year old cousin yelled, ""There's another one!"".  Looking to the left, there was another craft like the first one, moving towards the first.  I then asked my older cousin to try and record with her phone camera.  As the night was very dark, all she could pick up was the intense strobe. After about 30 minutes of the two craft maneuvering, 2 more appeared.  These 4 craft moved all over the sky, stopping and hovering, moving in diagonals, and going straight up in the air to very high altitudes.  They would cycle through many colors:  Red, Blue, Orange, Green, White and Purple. My Mom observed a slight aura or haze around the objects, which I couldn't see. Object number #1 at times stopped, and the ""colored"" ball moved to the center of a ring of lights that flashed in sequential pattern, then reconfigured to the Ball left/flashing lights right pattern. There was no noise of jet engines or helicopter blades the entire time. At times, my 10-year old cousin actually sat in the grass to watch these things. These were not meteors, satellites, drones or aircraft (planes/helicopters). I am an IT specialist, US Army veteran with a hobby of photographing aircraft.

The location we choose is void of light with very little light pollution from the city, perfect for stargazing and watching out for shooting stars.  What would be a routine sky watching evening would turn anything but.  At approximately 1:30 both my wife and I witnessed what we would both classify as the exact same event as described on July 27th, post 1 of 2. We saw what we thought was a shooting star entering the Earth’s atmosphere from the northeast at 30-40 degrees above the horizon on a bearing of 210.  Just as we thought the object was about to flame out it immediately slowed down to the speed of a commercial jetliner and the brightness of a normal star.  After approximately 5-6 seconds it accelerated to the same speed as it had entered the atmosphere and the same brightness.  Needless-to-say, we were both left speechless.

On Friday, September 27, 2019 at approximately 8:40pm in Blacksburg, Virginia I was outside walking my dog on the Huckleberry trail and as usual, looking up into the sky to see what I could notice. My first thoughts of the night were who exactly gets to occupy which altitudes in the sky? Because I noticed several aircraft in the in the air this evening, some at extremely high altitudes and others seemingly occupying various other levels of the atmosphere. One aircraft in particular, whom was closest to the ground that I presume to be of the private variety local to the Virginia Tech airport was flying in unusual patterns with a green, white and red light on it, I had taken the time to observe it because it appeared to be so unusual compared to the other aircraft I see in the air at night with red and white transponder lights.  Considering I observe a lot of aircraft in the sky, it’s a regular occurrence here in Blacksburg, this particular aircraft was behaving in a way that made me consider the possibility some kind of driver’s education, behind the wheel class was going on? A minute or so would pass as I continued walking down the path and I looked up into the sky again to see the most amazing things. There are three objects in the sky, one at the 11, 12 and 2 o’clock positions and they appear to be on fire. They were clustered together, seemingly moving independent of one of another but the object at the 2 o’clock position moved around freely, very firefly, serpentine like and appeared to change altitudes and directions efficiently. There was a rocket booster looking affect to the objects, but they were clearly emitting some kind of flame. Unfortunately, I did not have my camera with me but I did sprint in vein in an attempt to get one.  By that point, the objects were gone.  The airplane I saw moving erratically in the sky no doubt was observing this same behavior and there was an uptick in traffic in my area immediately following the event, so I would have to think it was witnessed by more than just myself on ground level.",2019-10-04T00:00:00,,

I saw a strange plane or craft flying low over trees on the outer cape in the town of Eastham.  I proceeded to Cape Cod Bay to check on the direction of craft and if it was a plane.  The craft flew out of my sight but I noticed many other lights (crafts? Orbs ? ) flying over the tip on Race Point in Province Town.   This event lasted for a long while.  I filmed the lights from a tripod with my DSLR for a couple minutes.  Amazing light show.  They dipped and flew across Cape Cod Bay at very low altitudes just skimming the water.  The footage is from a distance but the crafts are clearly visible as it was a very clear night.  Very Strange.,2019-10-04T00:00:00,41.7457,-69.9753

The color ! of the craft was a grayish dull steel appearance with intricate box shaped  or square parts on the exterior located towards the center .

As one Began to burn brightly above the tree line out of no where and start going up, the one before it would get lighter, the one  before that would get dimmer, and the last would burn out. My daughter stepped out from the van to see what dad was watching and started yelling, ""what is that?"" All I could say with disbelief was, ""I don't know... I don't know""   We watched as this pattern continued for 30 seconds or more. I tried to take film, but my phone would not get a clear shot because of the street lights. It almost looked like it could be a large spinning object because the lights would just start in the atmosphere and move from south west to north west in that same angle 20 feet above the tree line. the objects were not rising from earth, but starting in the sky and ending in the upper part of the sky line. The pattern would start left and go right. and when the last Light started up, it was a bigger and brighter golden ball then the others and took longer to fade out as it went from south west to north west in night sky. it was just amazing to watch these lights start glowing out of no where and move left to right.

The object continued to speed up and then banked left again heading west. It did not slow down or take a wide turn, this time it was a direct 90 degree turn.

Took my dog out for his last night potty run about 10:45 pm tonight.  I always look up at the stars at night as it was something Dad and I used to do when I was growing up.  He was an engineer, designing early communication satellites, and I know quite a few of his designs are above us, circling the Earth.  Dad taught me how to identify a planet as opposed to a star, and how to track the satellites when they go overhead. Tonight, I caught a glimpse of a flash of white light out of the corner of my eye traveling from the west to the east/southeast sky above the star Altair (used my Sky Guide app to figure its location), then dismissed it as I thought it was a light of an airplane high overhead.  We are under the flight lines for our local airport and the nearby military base.  I looked to the south and then back over where I saw the light and saw a smaller glimmer of it.  Continued watching that area of the sky and it flashed again and again, somewhat in a predictive sequence about 2-3 seconds in between each flash and the duration of the flash was a fraction of a second which made it very hard to predict where it was going.  When it flashed again, this time it was like a streamer flying in the wind with a 1-2 second duration and then it disappeared, only to quickly flash again a few more times before the light dimmed out of sight. I do not believe it is a UFO craft.  I believe I saw a satellite which may have been knocked so it's spinning while in orbit and caught the sun reflecting off its solar panels (the flashing light) instead of a steady glow which moves in an arc across the night sky.  The flashing light was still traveling as if it were following a satellite arc, that's how I could guess where to look when I realized it wasn't an airplane flying overhead.    Just wondered if anyone else had seen the same thing tonight.  Pretty interesting!",2019-06-27T00:00:00,35.03683522123894,-78.92246247787611

Even with the naked eye you could see the lights scanning through the trees.  They moved smoothly and quickly, like drones almost but they aren't drones.

I was at a birthday party with my friends and we were around 14-15 years old.  It was a cold, clear night in December and, the house was in a neighborhood on a high hill overlooking the valley.  We could see the night sky for miles around. We left the party to walk to another friend’s house to bring her to the party.  As we were walking down the road, we noticed a strange disk that was slowly moving from behind a grove of trees.  It was moving from left to right in a straight line.  It was close and not much higher than the trees and was a silverish gray color.  It seemed to be rotating/spinning with white, rectangular lights around the middle.  It made a very low, soft, humming sound. We just stopped and stared.  Someone asked what was it?  I was mesmerized and couldn’t believe what we were seeing.  I wasn’t scared but, couldn’t figure out what it could be.  The disk then stopped moving and just hovered in place.  It seemed to be still spinning.  Then it started moving from right to left, back towards the trees.  We took another road to the left to get our friend and we paralleled the disk for a few minutes.  Then, it disappeared behind the trees. A few minutes later, I expected to see the disk on the other side of the grove of trees, but it was gone.  We didn’t see or hear it anymore.   We could see stars and the blinking lights of planes but, never saw the disk again.  We went back to the party and no one said anything more about it.  I told my parents and they didn’t know what to make of it.  My friends and I never talked about it again.

I was in summer school at Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama, around July of 1978. My girlfriend and future wife worked at the Tuskegee Holiday Inn, just off of I-85.  I was on my way to pick her up for work.  Her shift at the front desk ended at 11:00PM. It was about 10:55pm, when I was about two miles from the hotel, on the same road that it sits. As I was driving, in pitch black then, with no street lights, I picked up in my peripheral vision, a bright light to my left.  When I turned to see where the light source was coming from, I saw a “Yellow Circular  Orb.  It was silent and matched my ground speed at around 50 mph. It was at about the level that the height of a light post would be, but again, there were none then. I have been down that road since then and there are light post now.  It moved silently alone with me for about 5 to 10 seconds, quickly moved to the front of my car, and in a flash, took a serpentine path towards the stars and seemed to because a star, as I watched it through my front windshield. My girl and I were in the middle of being mad, for some reason, at each other. When that happened, I don’t say much to her. But when I picked her up that night, and got about to the spot where the encounter occurred I spoke. As I started to speak, I could see the shock on her face, as she knew that I didn’t speak to her when we fussed,  She was silent hearing my story out. ANd from that point on, she always said that she believed me, because it was well out of the norm for me to have spoken to her under the circumstances. I was prompted to report this encounter all these years later, because of the obvious doubt that surround people who have seen this vehicles. There was also no where to report it then. I also have seen Yellow Orbs on more than one of the UFO shows, that look just like the vehicle that I witnessed that night. NOTE: Subsequent to this encounter, I got 10 hours flight training as a Cessna 152 student pilot and am a former flight attendant with two different airlines.

We were awakened by a flash of light.  I remember standing up and stepping out into the yard so I could see what it was. All of a sudden, there was a white flash of light that came from something above our property. I had a clear view of it easily. We didn't have any trees or tall buildings in the way, and there weren't any clouds that I remember either, although there could've been some clouds.   From the time I woke up until the light flashed again, I'd say about 10 to 15 seconds had elapsed.  When it flashed, it was the whitest, brightest light I had ever seen.  The time duration of the flash of light was only a split second.  When it flashed again, it had moved a little since the last flash, in a westerly direction, I'd say about 50 to 100 feet.  That is according to the height from the ground it seemed to be at.  It felt like it was around 100 or 200 feet in the air.  When it f! lashed again, it was exactly the same, and had moved the same more distance to the west... another 50 to 100 feet, the same speed, time interval, light intesity, direction, etc. There was no sound of any kind coming from it; it was silent, and everything outside was silent. 	In total, I watched it do this about 4 times. My sister stood next to me the entire time and watched what I watched. We watched this all happen while standing in the same spot in the yard. About a minute later, we ran into the house to wake up our parents and show them. It must have been around midnight, I'm guessing. We tried to make our parents go outside and look at what we were looking at, but they just looked out the front porch window, which was in the wrong direction, and the porch roof was in the way. We both got mad because they didn't just go outside and look up where we looked. Anyways, they never did see anything. To my knowledge, there weren't anymore flashes of light that night. 	To this day, my sister remembers seeing this beause I asked her a few years ago if she remembers seeing the UFO we saw when we were kids and she said yes, she remembered. We both saw the same thing, and both heard no sound. 	I know what I saw. It was pitch black outside. There were super white light flashes coming from something not very far above our property. There was no sound of any kind, mechanical or otherwise. What the thing did was methodical, and silent. It wasn't a helicopter or anything else with a search light looking for someone. It lit up everything. It was such an intense light, it could've lit up the entire town for all I know. This happened in the summer of either 1981 or 1982. Possibly 1983, but I doubt it. I was between 8 and 10 years old at the time. I am now 46 years old. I've never forgotten it, and my memories of it have not changed a bit.",2019-07-25T00:00:00,47.5587,-120.4889

In April 1989 right after midnight I was driving alone in my car south on the road between Pocatello, Idaho, and Tremonton, Utah.  I was on a stretch of land where I could only see lights of a couple of farm houses far off to the west of the road.  Just before the Idaho/Utah border I noticed some pulsating lights that were red, yellow, green, blue.  I thought it was a very large lighted road sign.  I have driven that road many times before and thought it strange that I had never seen a road sign along that road before.  I thought, ""What is a lighted road sign doing out here in the middle of nowhere?""  I was to later realize that the lights were right on the Utah - Idaho border.   As I got about a block away suddenly the pulsating lights started to blend into each other and a very large black disk shaped object slowly rose up.  It made no sound whatsoever. It was just after midnight and the sky was filled with stars.  I could see the disk shaped object only becau! se it covered the stars.  It was about 6 stories high and a block long with these lights now blending into each other around the center of the saucer shaped disk.  It hovered above me in the air for only a few minutes, and then suddenly went straight east (not upward, but sideways) and disappeared behind the range of mountains to the east.  I was so shocked I stopped the car along the side of the road and sat there for I don't know how long. I was trying to figure out what I had just witnessed.  Then what appeared to me to be a few min. later, a couple of cars passed me along the road. I became frightened that the object might come back, so I turned on the engine and drove to my home in Orem, Utah.  I arrived home around 3 am from what should have been a 2 or 2 1/2 hour drive, so I may have lost some time inbetween.  I did not know who to report the incident to so I called the Preston Idaho police department to find out if there were any other reports of UFOs in the area.  The wom! an on the line said there were none.  So I wrote a letter to th! at depar tment outlining the incident just so it could be officially reported to someone.  Later I noticed that my bellybutton was reeking a small amount of pus, as was my right ear.  The infections cleared up in a couple of weeks.     About 20 years later I went back to the area and looked at the field of sagebrush where the object had sat. I noticed three circles where the sage brush had not grown.  As I think back on the incident I feel it was an object being tested by our military, or why else would it be sitting right on the Utah/Idaho border?  A saucer from outer space would have no need to sit on an unmarked state border.  I have told only my close family members about the incident.  I later authored a book about Satanic Ritual Abuse (Twenty Two Faces:  Inside the Extraordinary Life of Jenny Hill and Her Twenty Two Multiple Personalities) and do not want to have my name associated with the incident as it would invite ridicule associated to my name. I wish to remain anonymous. I have had! no nightmares about the incident, nor any memory of abduction.

I started kinda getting an uneasy feeling, but kept going. Not even 5 seconds down the road, and I mean within seconds of finishing my last thought. I looked out my rearview mirror, and there was this light.  Just one, very low to the ground about the size of a basketball.  My instincts at first was a car with one headlight or a motorcycle. Then I remembered the figure at the window, and my body instantly covered in goosebumps. I kept driving which normally I'd have pulled over to let them pass as I have difficulty driving at night sometimes. The light that was following my car, was white and it was very low to the ground, like right at my back window.  Then it would slightly pull back, then it would disappear.  But seconds later it would be there again...  it kept coming and going.  It was not always on the same side of the road, but the idea was all the same.  So after about the 5th time this happened, I sped up. As I sped up I kept talking to my daughter not saying much, just reassuring myself she was still with me.  I at some points was going 70 mph because I was so scared, but it just kept catching up to me.  I floored it and just kept looking forward, but glancing in the rearview mirror. It followed me all the way to the end of the road. Once home and shaken and scared to death, I asked her if she had seen anything strange.  And she too had seen the light and said it kept making a flash before disappearing. I have never experienced anything like this as I said, and I've taken that particular road everyday to and from work.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,43.9565,-69.7653

Pisgah toward the south.  Pisgah has a LARGE tv tower on the very top; Mt. Pisgah is slightly over 5700'.  We noticed a white light moving very smoothly to our right, directly in line with the top light of the tower, moving away from the tower, but not extremely fast.  It then went the exact opposite direction without seeming to turn at all, back toward the tower.  It went what appeared to be close to the tower, stopped a brief second or so, then traveled the same line back away from the tower until it was in what appeared to be the middle of the line of travel it had been following.  It then shot straight up at an extremely high rate of speed and disappeared.   Everyone I've mentioned it to, at the time and in the years since, has just dismissed my account.

The Army helicopter 68-15444 was returning from Columbus, Ohio, to Cleveland, Ohio, and SE of Mansfield Airport while flying at an altitude of 2500 feet and on a heading of 030 degrees, SSG Yanacsek observed a red light on the east horizon, 90 degrees to the flight path of the helicopter.  Approximately 30 seconds later, Yanacsek indicated the object was converging on the helicopter at the same altitude at an airspeed in excess of 600 knots and on a midair collision heading. Captain Coyne observed the converging object, took over the controls of the aircraft and initiated a power descent from 2500 feet to 1700 feet to avoid impact with the object.  A radio call was initiated to Mansfield Tower who acknowledged the helicopter and was asked by Capt. Coyne if there were any high performance aircraft flying in the vicinity of Mansfield Airport, however there was no response received from the tower.  The crew expected impact from the object; instead the object was observed to hesitate momentarily over the helicopter and then slowly continued on a westerly course accelerating at a high rate of speed, clear west of Mansfield Airport then turn 45 degrees heading to the NW.  Capt. Coyne indicated the altimeter read a 100 fpm (feet per minute) climb and read 3500 feet with the collective in the full down position.  The aircraft was returned to 2500 feet by Capt. Coyne and flown back to Cleveland, Ohio.  The flight plan was closed and the FAA Flight Service Station notified of the incident.  The radio returned to normal 10 minutes after the incident, having gone completely dead on both UHF and VHF frequencies just after Coyne had established contact with Mansfield control tower.  Some witnesses on the ground reported seeing the helicopter as well as and object ""like a blimp"" and ""as big as a school bus"" hovering above the helicopter.  When the UFO's gr! een ligh t appeared it was described by the witnesses as ""like rays coming down and the helicopter, the trees, the road and everything turned green.""  Capt Coyne:  ""From a speed of 600 mph, it abruptly slowed down to our exact speed of 100 mph and hovered above us.""  Co-pilot Jezzi:  ""The object was cigar-shaped, metallic grey, with a dome on top.""   Staff Sergeant Healey : ""It was about 60 feet long, without any portholes or intake openings that we could see.  At first it was just showing a red light in nose.  Then a green spotlight at the back swept around and shone into our cabin.""  (Sources: Zeidman, NARCAP Case 36, Army Disposition Form 23 Nov 1973). Reviewing his instruments, Coyne noticed that the magnetic compass was rotating slowly, while the Radio Magnetic Indicator was functioning normally.  He descended to the previously assigned cruise altitude of 2,500 feet and made radio contact with the Akron/Canton air traffic controllers.

I'm reporting many years later.  It was a lovely summer evening.  Myself and several boys around my age were just killing time in a school building alcove we called the cage. It was covered by the building and had to open sides.  The side nearest the parking lot and an open area of blacktop and school yard and a ball field.  And just to our right or southwest of our location was an old tree.  After going over these events over the last years I have always wondered why this particular tree was saved from being sawed down being it was the only tree around.  They had even blacktopped around it. I know,having no proof,believe the tree was spared because other people may have seen what I saw and believed the tree had some significance.  So as myself and my friends were sitting there on the beautiful summer night.  I was the first to notice it.  A glowing ball like object floating over the tree.It h! ad the same color white as you see in many scifi movies,that bright white light.  Although my friends were scared of the object,i have always been very daring and I walked right up to it.  My friends followed when they saw I was safe.  I have to say, when I say I walked up to it, i mean I got closer, but before I could actually stand underneath it, it moved.  Like a steak, very fast movement.  I would characterize the movement as, zipping.  Well it moved to the back part of the school the other side then we were that was considerable darker.We all followed in wonder.   As we reached the new location it was situated a little higher then previously.  About phone pole high. I could here some neighbors who had been out walking their dog, referring to the object.  But I don't remember exactly what they were saying.  But I do know they were acknowledging it.  As I walked off to it's west profile,it started shrinking in it's space,and shaking.  It reminded me of how small grass spiders shake their we when! I used to poke at them with small stick,or like when vehicles! travel very fast,they shake.  By the time i realized that it wasn't shrinking in place but actually traveling away at the perfect angle to give the false impression.  And just as I realized what was truly happening it was gone.  We all went home and I told my mother who didn't believe me. So she called the oldest boy with us that night who was a very honest kid.  He currently holds a position of prominence locally.  Now I have never compared stories with any of the other boys involved.  Other then my mothers phone conversation with the one boy.One boy has since passed.  And when I did manage to run into one of the other viewers ,and remembered to ask about it.  This one boy told me that severe alcohol abuse had removed all memory from that time.",2019-09-19T00:00:00,41.59506666666666,-87.48469452736319

To the best of my recollection, this occurred on Highway 51 East between Mannford and Lotsee, Oklahoma, in the Fall of 1987.  It was a weeknight.  The time was approximately 2AM-3AM.  The sky was clear, dry conditions.  I was not chemically altered in any way. I lived in Tulsa and worked for the school system, after graduating from Oklahoma State University in 1986.  I performed with a band, and we had frequent gigs in Stillwater at various establishments. Returning from Stillwater to Tulsa after a show, I drove along highway 51 and, perhaps 10 miles outside of Mannford,  I noticed a bright light in the sky, fairly low on the horizon.  I passed through Mannford on highway 51, and continued on the stretch of 51 that slopes in a gradual hill up towards the area before Sand Springs, which I believe is called Lotsee.  Highway 51, at this time, was one lane each way, with shoulders on either side.  There was mostly scrub oak and brush bordering the highway. Here, through the windshield of my car, I saw a large craft low in the sky. I pulled over and exited my vehicle.  There were approximately 8-12 other vehicles pulled over, and people were standing next to their cars and looking up at the craft, as I was.  It was dark, not lit, rectangular in shape, and perhaps the size of a football field.  It made no noise, and looked as though it was ""parked"" in the sky.  I estimate perhaps 100-200 feet about the roadway. I could see, for lack of a better description, superstructure on the underside of the object.  It was not smooth underneath. After a period of time, approximately 5-20 minutes, the craft began to move silently away in a southwesterly direction.  Multi-colored lights cycled around the exterior bottom of the ship. One revolution, then dark.  Another revolution, then dark, etc. I, and the other motorists, all watched as it passed beyond the tree line and out of sight.  At this point, I entered my car and drove off without speaking to the other witnesses (no one spoke while the event occurred either).  As I drove past, I noticed everyone was doing this. I recall being extremely tired on the remainder of the drive home.  I entered my apartment, woke my sleeping wife, told her I had seen a UFO, and fell quickly asleep.  The next morning, I shared the event details with her.

My mom took me and a group of my friends out to a lake and we spent the evening walking in the hills and then started fishing as the sun was setting.  We were all just having a relaxing evening and there was only one other group at the lake, another family of maybe 5, it was just us out in an isolated area.  All of a sudden, just as the sun lowered below the tree line (so the sky still had an orange/purpleish tinge to it) we heard this strange noise like a mechanical sound but what made it so strange (aside from being out in the middle of nowhere) was that it didn’t just come from one spot.  The sound seemed to be coming from all around us, it surrounded us basically.  The two guys in our group went over the tiny hill separating us from the other family to ask if maybe the noise was coming from them?  They came back and said the family had thought the noise was from us.  We were trying to figure out what it wa! s when suddenly, a huge light kind of rose from behind the trees and just slowly kept rising in the sky until it stopped.  When it stopped, it looked like a door was opening (if you focused enough, you could see a couple of orange lights around the area that “opened”) and the light got brighter but you could see like 3 more balls of lights leaving from the “door” and then one of those 3 lights got big and released 3 more lights and this all happened in a sort of diagonal pattern.  Then the lights each grouped up near the center of the sky (very slowly and deliberately) and hovered there for a couple of seconds, it could’ve been longer, and then out of nowhere, they seemed to merge and then split into four groups and each went in each direction so one group went across the sky to the north and so on.  But it happened so quickly, everything else happened rather slowly but when they went across the sky, it was in the blink of an eye.  I don’t know how far away from earth they were! but if I were looking at stars, they would be millions of lig! htyears away from each other.  After that, they just hovered in their spots.  My mom finally got us all herded into the truck and immediately drove us home but as far as I could see, the lights never moved from their spots.  I forgot to mention, with the mechanical noise, it also felt like there was a slight vibration or something, like you could feel it in your bones but it was very subtle.

Cars were passing under it.   Light was shining through the windows on the top of the craft.   Bottom of the craft had many bright white lights of varying sizes along with raised areas and small square indented panels that looked like glass that emitted soft white yellow lights.  Craft was light metallic silver color.   It did not make any noise.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,,

I’m an equipment operator at a power plant working night shift.  It was a beautiful, crystal clear night, and I could see almost every star in the sky!  While moving material in my bulldozer, a peculiar moving light caught my attention in my peripherals.  So I turned my dozer around to get check out what I saw.  To the south-west approx. 30-50ft in the air I see a spherical orangish orb, about the size of a basketball frantically darting around.  I was a little alarmed and couldn’t figure out what it could be, and to get a better vantage point of the object I, drove my dozer up on top of the pile of material (approximately 55 feet high).  It took me about 20 seconds to drive up there, and by then the orb was still visible, but a little further out and at this point I was having difficulty seeing it thru distant trees.  I shut off my dozer and turned off the lights, and began to examine the area. At this point my supervisor, a very intelligent and rational degreed Engineer, drove around the pile.  I presumed he had circled around the pile and continued back to the power plant, making a routine round.  While panning the skyline from the top of the pile, I spot something peculiar at a low altitude, in the eastern sky.  It was a prominent equilateral  triangular craft with lights at each point, flashing sometimes in unison and at some moments, different times.  The lights flashed blue at times, as well as red and brilliant white.  The craft was just hovering there, completely silent.  Occasionally it would dramatically dart in different directions, hovering at each pause.  It was mind bending. I was about to call my supervisor over the radio, to tell him what I’m seeing, but decided against it, not wanting to be ridiculed and joked about for being “crazy”, or being told to put on my ‘tin foil benie’.  The craft began to very slowly hover towards my location. I scrambled for my cellphone in hopes of capturing a video.  At this point, I thought my supervisor had continued up to the plant when he had made his round about 5 minutes prior, but unbeknownst to me he had seen the same curious triangle as I, and had stopped to film it, and at this moment he was calling me over the radio, to ask if I was seeing this bizzare, anomalous triangular craft!  I was perplexed and relieved that he was witnessing this as well!!  I exclaimed that I was watching it too, and that I took a video, he replied that he was capturing a video as well and was baffled at this bizzare sighting.  The craft began slowly heading west, in my direction, so I jumped back in my bulldozer, called my supervisor and told him I would meet him at the bottom of the pile to discuss what we were seeing.  I quickly made it to the bottom of the pile, shutting my dozer back off, and told my supervisor that I had a pair of high quality 10x42 birders in my truck, and I told him to keep his eye on the craft while I go and get them.  I sprinted about 100 yards to whe! re my tr uck was parked, grabbed my binoculars and sprinted back.  He pointed to where the craft was, it was quite a ways out but we could still see it on the horizon where it appeared to vere at a sudden 90° angle to the south (as if it was going to circle around back towards our direction),  I quickly pulled up my binos, panning to see the craft & as soon as I got it in my view there was a bright flash of light & the craft was gone!  Faster than a snap of my fingers!  My jaw dropped, & we both quickly looked at each other and said, “Did you see that!?!”  We were perplexed frantically wondering what the hell this thing was & where it just went!?!?  We stood there gazing every inch of the sky, looking for it, sharing our videos with each other and pondering as to what we just saw.. to the south of our location about 5 miles away, there’s a small private dirt air strip that hosts a couple of fly over events each summer.  The small air field has a only a couple tiny hangers and can only accommodate small, single passenger personal biplanes.  We are use to seeing the small planes in the area, and can easily hear them as well as high flying commercial jets, even over the noise of the equipment, so we were flabbergasted that in the silent of the night, with our equipment turned off, the triangular craft, flying probably less than a thousand feet in the air was completely.  It didn’t make a sound at all, it was very eerie, causing the hair on my neck to stand on end.  It’s also worth noting that high flying, commercial jets are an often occurrence, and we occasionally see the biplanes in the area, our facility is a Federally Regu! lated facility, so the low flying airspace around the one or two mile footprint of the plant is strictly governed, & the only aircraft that we see directly over head (w/ exception too high commercial jets at 25,000-30,000 ft) is the helicopter belonging to the power utility may fly over to do a line inspection.  Other than that we never have air traffic above us..  So, that was another alarming factor of this sighting. After a few more minutes of talking with the supervisor we parted ways and went back to work.  About 30-45 minutes later, 2 large (very loud) dark colored military style helicopters flew over the plant on the exact trajectory as the triangular object did just shortly before! And the next morning on shift turnover, an employee from another crew, who lives nearby, unprompted, asked me if i was able to hear or see the big military choppers from the pile last night, it was strange considering the nearest [active] military base is a couple hours away, and we rarely see training exercises in our area. A very bizzare one of a kind sighting, an anomaly I won’t forget !",2019-10-04T00:00:00,44.42850000000001,-70.1499

On the evening of June 22, 2019, at 23:50 hrs.  I was out side with my dog before we were in for the night. I noticed off to the western sky, just above the treeline, there was a smallish red ball shaped object moving into my line of sight.  As it moved across the sky I expected to see it burn out quickly as you would expect a meteor to do.  However it did not.  It did not also leave a trail of any kind as I have seen from personal meteor sightings in the past. As the red ball continued across the sky, I listened for the tell tale sound of a high flying and fast moving aircraft but heard nothing.  To the north, Mother Nature was putting on a light show but there was no sound coming from that either. I looked for wing lights blinking, or any other sign of lights or such coming from the object but saw nothing, just a glowing red light surrounding the object just as an object entering the atmosphere would glow red.  As I stated earlier, I kept expecting it to burn out, but no. It continued across the sky until it went all of the way across my range of sight and disappeared into the eastern horizon. In all, this sighting lasted no more than 20 to 25 seconds at most, from horizon to horizon. Not a sound was heard. Nothing trailed out from behind.  No blinking lights of any kind. It stayed the same redish color from the second I saw it until it went out of sight. It appeared to be a rather large object as well because when you look at aircraft lights they appear to be tiny dots. This did not.  Comparatively speaking, it is like comparing a period at the end of one of these sentences to the eraser on the end of a pencil.  Big difference.  This was the eraser and aircraft lights the period. The most eerie thing was the lack of sound.  I hear aircraft at altitude fly overhead all of the time and expected something appearing so big to make some kind of sound.

I looked over, and the sky lit up once again! I stared in awe. I had now noticed that the sky pulsated with a red and blue light that caused the illusion of purple in some parts of it. It was so beautiful that one could mistake it for the northern lights (which was my second idea). It happened about three to four times within the timespan of less than a minute or so. I pulled out my phone to record it, but my phone wouldn't respond- and by the time I got to recording, it had stopped and my bus came moments later.

When i saw what a first thought was a satellite moving across the sky.  But after i while i saw another one right behind the first one flying in the same line.  This kept going and it looked like a dotted string moving across the sky.  There where like 30-40 lights following the same path with almost the same distance between everyone of them.  They flew a bit faster than the airplanes in the sky at that moment. At one time it seemed the 2 last lights stopped for a moment before moving along. The lights was brighter than most of the stars. I dont know if satellites fly in in groups following the same path.  But not according to a live satellite map. The distance between the lights is hard to tell.  But if you hold a ruler in stretched arm in front of the sight it was about 10-15centimeter between the lights. The event lasted between 5 and 10 minutes before all of the lights was out of sight.,2019-12-01T00:00:00,,

I was staying at a friend's ranch which backs up to the Santa Rita Mountains and some of the last 'open range' left in America. The government has so much land there they literally let people graze cattle or do whatever they want on the land. I was recovering from an assault with a baseball bat, struck to head several times and spent three years in rehab therapy. Coming from LA, I had never seen nighttime skies like that. The nearest town, Sahuarita, was 10 miles away and has a light pollution ban on any white lights, so when the magnificent sunsets were over, you were left with a sky that looked like a planetarium. My eyes were hyper sensitive to light following the assault, and I couldn't watch television or any synthetic light of any kind. So I would sit on the porch or stand out in the open corral and stair up the stars, usually meditating and praying my brain would eventually recover. One night, I was standing out in the corral, and I noticed a light, what I thought was a meteor or falling star streak across the nighttime sky. It was common place to witness 'shooting stars' as frequently as every few minutes. However this one straked across the sky from the south west across/ above the Santa Ritas and when I assumed it would disappear as they always had, the light stopped, remained in the air, got brighter white, then dimmed, then turned red, moved across the sky to my east. It stopped again, then went what looked to me as up, stopped again and began flashing green, red, and back to white. Over the next few minutes it continued to hover, move as fast as if I had a laser pointer, then stop again. I went from thinking my brain was hallucinating to having a reaction to my meds, to accepting this was real. I went back to the ranch house and called for my friend to come out and look at this. She reluctantly came out and when I pointed to the light she said, ""Oh yeah, you're just seeing this? I guess your head was pretty messed up!"" I looked at her dumbfounded, was this happening? She went on to say, that's nothing, when she was living on a ranch years ago, she actually saw one land while on a late night ride through the desert. My friend is a Champion Barrel Racer and works as a Science Teacher for 'at risk' high school students. She is one of the smartest people I know and has an advanced degree in Animal Science from U of A. Not someone who fell off the apple cart. My eyes were so sensitive to light that I began to see other strange lights, sometimes several at once (the most I remember seeing was a group of 8). One of the first things I did when my eyes began to accept synthetic light from screens was to download a Skytracker app so I could identify what I was looking at. I was able to instantly identify each star I pointed at and even satellites. For months, I would go out when my alert for the Space Station would pass by. But every time I saw one of these lights, the app showed black space on the screen. My friend's marathon running partner is a top operational engineer over-seeing top secret programs at Raytheon. I asked her if they did test flights over the area. She told me officially Raytheon in Tucson deals with guidance systems and does not engage with the Airforce base there, nor to they do any aerial testing themselves. Unofficially she said, we are a multi-billion dollar defense company, which means we make a lot of stuff. Expensive stuff with cutting edge 'new' technology. And that technology needs to be tested in real world scenarios. She finished by saying, there's a reason we're in the desert and not in some city like LA. And there's a reason the Airforce is here and has a secret ops division. So you're smart, I'll let you figure the rest out for yourself. When I described what I saw, she said 'theoretically, if we had a project that required aerial testing, I would know about it as it falls under my team. But right now, we are in development phase so there is n! o testing going on. What you saw most likely wasn't ours.""  I asked her later about it more, maybe 6 months later and as I had gotten to know her better, she opened up one night a bit more. She basically said there's a lot of stuff that goes on that people are unaware of. Since most people don't just stare up at the sky for hours they are unaware of what goes on. Whatever the light was, I continued to see more until eventually I became bored with seeing strange lights. I would say the longest I went without seeing strange lights was two weeks. I completely believe most of what I saw was military, but as my for lack of better words, my spiritual psychic side definitely became more aware after the brain injury and I began to have a feeling or 'vibe' about what I was seeing. There was a certain sense when I would see what I 'felt' was man-made. Most of what I witnessed had that vibe. But on at least 10 other occasions, what I saw had a different vibe all together and felt very foreign or strange. Sorry for the long story, I'm sure it could be shorter but my writing is still not great after the injury. I don't think I'm unique in seeing this. The local ranchers I met and talked to all seemed to accept that strange lights would and have appeared over the Santa Ritas going back as far as anyone could remember. One old man told me since he was a kid and far before we developed drones. Anyway, thought I'd share. I am back in LA now having mostly recovered, but I would think the lights haven't stopped and anyone wishing to watch them only needs to drive out past the town of Sahuarita 10 or 15 miles and you will see them too.

UFO Summary  I have been somewhat negligent in writing this ufo sighting summary.  I believe part of it is due to life events, as well as concern whether or not my report can provide any value, compared to other reports I have heard and read.  However, this event has periodically plagued my mind for the last two years and I believe by providing this report, and possibly talking to someone regarding my incident, I may be able to find some sort of closure.  I will try to be as accurate and descriptive as possible.  Please feel free to reach out with any questions you may have.  Also, if time permits, I would greatly appreciate someone reaching out to me for the purpose of helping me process this event. Event Sighting:  I believe this event occurred in approximately March or April of 2017.  The time was at approximately 9:00pm.  The location of this event occurred in the parking lot of Planet Fitness located at 1175 Hill Road North Pickerington, Ohio 43147.  I was walking into the Planet Fitness to work out, when I happened to look in the sky, oriented in the Southern direction.  Initially, I just happened to look up very briefly almost as if by impulse.  When I looked up, I happened to see lights in the sky and did not think anything of it.  I then immediately looked back down to see where I was walking as I was in parking lot about to cross into a driving lane.  Almost instantaneously, as I looked down, my mind recognized that something seemed abnormal about the lights.  As I realized this abnormality, I looked back again and became very uncomfortable with what I began witnessing.  While the event itself may not seem “spectacular” in any way reading this, I can assure you that as an observe! r, it was a very unnerving event once my mind started processing what I was viewing. As I looked back up at the sky in a Southern direction, I saw 4 lights that I would characterize as a somewhat muted red/orange.  It will be somewhat difficult to describe distances and dimensions, but I will try my best.  If you can imagine me standing on the ground looking up at the lights, I would say the object was approximately 60 degrees in the air, using the flat ground as a 0 degree baseline.  The lights appeared to be approximately 1,000 feet away, in the Southern direction from my location at 1175 Hill Road North Pickerington, Ohio 43147.  The lights were traveling in an East by North-East direction, very slowly.  From a general observation perspective, I would say they were travelling at approximately 8 miles an hour.  The immense uncomfortability in that moment came when I began truly trying to understand what I was observing. As I looked up to analyze the 4 muted red/orange lights, I could see that these lights were moving in what appeared to be exact unison.  At first I thought they may be some sort of airplanes very far away.  I took specific note of their movement in attempts to understand what I was seeing but again, when I truly attempted to analyze the lights, it was apparent that there was no visible variance between their distance relative to one another.  I also realized that it was a cloudy night with clouds fairly close to the ground, and these lights were clearly visible under the clouds.  This ruled out any chance of these being distant aircraft.  This realization made me believe that these lights were much nearer than I initially expected,and that they must have been been affixed to the same originating object.  They were almost directly over a water tower.  I became increasingly uncomfortable as I began to perceive the size of the object these lights seemed to be a part of.  If these lights truly were on the same object, I would venture to guess that the “craft” was the size of a football field.  Oddly, the lights were oriented in a “diamond” shape, in relation to the trajectory of the craft (East by North-East).  I will try to explain the 4 lights’ positions using the illustration below.  Points A,B,C, and D almost exactly illustrates the location of the lights in relation to one another.  Again, in this illustration, the craft was moving in an upward and left direction from my perspective, meaning that the light at point D was “leading” the craft. I could hear absolutely no sound that would be indicative of a massive flying object this close to my location.  I also began having the overwhelming and distinct feeling of fear, terror, and powerlessness.  While I can not say I actually saw the body of the object, I would say my mind “worked out” the shape of the craft while I was viewing this.  I could almost see the outline of a black shape almost the exact shape above, but I cannot tell if I truly observed it with my eyes or if my mind “filled in the gaps” from the lights.  At this point of my viewing/analysis, the lights began being obscured by the clouds and eventually disappeared above the clouds. Unfortunately I was so mesmerized by this event that I did not think to take a picture with my phone.  Overall, from initial sighting to disappearance, I would say the entire event lasted only 10-15 seconds.  However, the event felt like minutes. Almost as soon as the 4 lights seemingly connect to the massive craft disappeared, I happened to see what appeared to be a brownish orb coming down from the sky.  With myself still looking in the Southern sky at  the same location, the orb was falling from the East approximately 600 feet from me.  I will be honest and say I have no idea what to make of the orb.  I noticed it when it was approximately 80-100 feet off the ground and falling at approximately 8-10 feet per second.  The orb was behaving like, and almost the size of a grocery bag in light wind but something did not seem right about it.  The orb seemed too illuminated to be just a bag.  Again, it was 9:00pm at night and this object was almost 600 feet from me.  There were street lights across the street in the direction of the orb but I cannot see any way how an average street light would have been able to illuminate the orb as brightly as it was.  Also, the orb fell to what seemed the ground from a height of appro! x. 100 feet.  Logically, it the orb was illuminated by the street light, the appearance and intensity of the illumination would have varied considerably.  While there was some variation on the surface of the orb in relation to its brightness, it did not seem to match what one would expect from its orientation to the street light.  Also, the surface exterior of the orb seemed to fluctuate. It seemed to have indentations and protrusions that continuously varied in positions to one another, but there were no sharp edges.  As the object was falling to the ground, I lost sight of it once it neared the ground and honestly, I did not stay there to see if it reappeared.  The amount of fear I began feeling propelled me to jump into my car and “hide” so to speak.  I would say the orb sighting lasted approximately 8 seconds. Reporting To Police: After sitting in my car for a few moments, maybe 15 minutes trying to figure out what in the heck just occurred, I decided to contact the police.  I decided to call the actual police station rather than 911. As I have written a lot so far, I will summarize by conversation briefly.  I asked the operator who answered the phone at the police station if anyone has reported odd lights in the sky.  The operator paused for a moment and asked me what kind of lights.  Very hesitantly, and with telling telling her that I know I’ll sound crazy, I said “like unexplainable lights.”  I briefly described what I saw in regards to the lights.  She stated that no one has reported anything tonight, but that an on-duty policeman reported something similar in almost the exact location I did, approximately 6 weeks or 6 months prior. Unfortunately I cannot remember if she said weeks or months but I  know she said 6.  She said that the policeman had reported the lights, tried to chase them and had ! absolutely no idea what they were.  She also stated that in that event, they called wright patterson airforce base to verify if they were flying craft(s) and the military said they had no craft in the area. Summary: Overall, I have no idea what to think of the orb but I can say with strong confidence that the 4 red/orange lights I saw were connected to an ariel object/craft in the sky.  I believe myself to be a fairly logical person and following this event, I have dwelled on this incident for hours.  Based on the exact uniform movement of the lights and their positioning in relation to one another, the color of the lights (which never blinked), the fact that they were visible under low cloud cover, the fact that I could hear absolutely zero sound indicative of an aerial vehicle, and the fact that a police officer observed something somewhat similar recently; I have no choice but to believe this was some sort of ufo (terrestrial or non-terrestrial). Overall, I wanted to share my story and see if anyone would be able to contact me to provide their thoughts on the event.  Again, this event has periodically plagued me for 2 years as I’m a very logical person who seeks the truth in all instances.

I was driving my girlfriend to her doctor's appointment.  Our sighting lasted about one minute or less.  While slowing to exit from one interstate highway to another I noticed what appeared to be a metallic saucer-shaped craft high in the air. The craft was north of our position at about 45 degrees above the horizon.  I estimate the altitude may have been 10,000-15,000 feet (higher than a light prop plane but lower than a cruising airliner).  At the time there was a sunny clear-blue sky to the north without clouds and unlimited visibility.  There were clouds to the south but they were not a factor.  I watched the craft trying to determine whether it might be an airplane, but there was absolutely no discernible movement, nor were there any FAA lights, markings, noise or! vapor trails.  The disc was hovering and reflecting the sunlight.   I'm 58 years old, BS with honors, am familiar with military and civilian spacecraft and aircraft, meteorology, astronomy, and relatives from NASA, NSA, and Army helicopters.  This craft did not appear to be one of ""ours.""  After deciding for myself that the craft in question might very well be an extraterrestrial vehicle rather than a man-made aircraft I pointed it out to my girlfriend.  She observed the shiny hovering disc for about 15 seconds and came to the same conclusion.  My girlfriend also is mature, college degreed, and the owner/operator of an online store.  We both watched the disc hover, seemingly motionless, reflecting the sun, and then it appeared to vanish into thin air without a trace.  We scanned the clear-blue sky but the ""saucer"" apparently cloaked itself, raced off in the blink of an eye, and/or perhaps disappeared into another dimension of time/space.  We did not see or hear a! ny man-made aircraft in the sky in that direction at the time ! of our d isc sighting. Only the shiny metallic saucer-shaped craft.  No clouds, airplanes or helicopters.  However, both of us heard a military jet fighter roar over our house at approximately 10 a.m. the same day, about four hours before we saw the UFO disc.   We live in rural King William County about 30 minutes northeast of where we saw the disc. We have seen many black unmarked helicopters over our property, and occasional jets, especially in conjunction with other resident's UFO reports, but I believe this was the first jet fighter in a few months and we found it noteworthy since the fighter plane was monitoring our area a few hours before we saw the UFO. Just a ""coincidence""?  There is an Army base with heliports and airstrips controlled by the NSA, including ""secret"" underground tunnels, about 30 minutes northwest of our home but the aforementioned chopper and jet-fighter flights are not routine and nearly always coincide with MUFON/NUFORC reports by other local! witnesses.  My girlfriend and I believe the ETs are mostly benign and it's the ""shadow government"" and military/industrial/intelligence complex that people should be concerned about.  We believe the ETs probably monitor the shadow government facilities and vice versa.  We believe the latter information and opinion is relevant and should be considered in conjunction with our possible extraterrestrial disc sighting because of the unusual jet fighter roaring over our house the same day.  Note: Our shiny, reflective UFO disc sighting outside Richmond, VA, occurred on the afternoon of July 9, 2018 and I reported it to the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) on the morning of July 10, 2018 (MUFON case 93248).    Then on the morning of July 15, 2018 I discovered a NUFORC case from Springfield, VA, about a shiny, reflective possible UFO disc seen in the daytime on July 8, 2018, but posted to NUFORC on July 13, 2018.  The NUFORC case reminded me of our Richmond sighting first reported to MUFON.  Bottom line:  Someone in Northern Virginia near Washington, D.C., saw a possible UFO disc during the day on July 8, and then my girlfriend and I saw a possible UFO disc during the day outside Richmond (120 miles south of D.C.) on July 9, and a military fighter jet made an unusual pass over our rural home on July 9 about four hours before we saw the disc-shaped UFO.  All just a ""coincidence""?",2019-09-06T00:00:00,37.558607538635506,-77.50798002261591

They were approximately 100 yards away and were both about six-eight feet off the grassy ground.  Both moved slowly back and forth in tandem at times and over a distance in length of about 100 feet. 	Background to the grassy area was a line of alder and other shrubs about varying in height from four to seven feet and behind that stood the trees, both deciduous and evergreens varying in height from 50 to 60+ feet. 	These  orbs omitted no sounds or flashes of light or beams of concentrated light.  No other ambient light was present (there are no street lights nor were any porch lights on in the two houses that framed each side of the area in question).  The moon phase was waning gibbous. 	I was alone in the house and did not think to take a picture or video.  I was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

I got out of bed and looked out to see two large round orange lights sitting on top of the tallest tree in the yard (about 70 feet tall) which was about 40 feet from the house.  One light was slightly smaller (1-1.5 feet in diameter) than the other one (2-2.5 feet in diameter).  The larger one had a swirling center like the sun has and they just lit up the entire yard.  They did not move and were very close to each other but not touching. 	I watched them for about two minutes before they moved away higher toward the sky and then were gone instantaneously without a trail of light.

We usually clean up and try to be ready to go home by 1:40 A.M. every night.  And that night we did, we were out by 1:40 A.M.  It’s about a 5 minute walk to my car.   I drove out of the shipyard and decided I wanted a beer so I stopped at a gas station in Bremerton which is right on my way home.  At this point it’s about 1:50 A.M. when I left the gas station I have a 15 to 20 minute drive to my house.  I get to Gorst that’s about 10 miles or so from my house, and for some reason I start thinking how lonely it is out here there’s not a person or a car in sight.  I got a little bit of a creepy feeling about it but I brushed it off.  After all I thought to myself, it’s labor day weekend, everyone is out of town of course no one is going to be around.   So I drove on.  I get to downtown Port Orchard and as I’m driving through I couldn’t help but think about how empty it was, no cars, no people again I kind of got creeped out about it reminded me of an abandoned town.  Then I thought, it is 2:00 A.M. everything is closed there’s no business it’s labor day weekend and kept driving.  Now I’m on my final leg home I’m on Mile Hill Drive about 5 minutes from home or 3 or 4 miles.  Now let’s fast forward to what started to happen.   As I make my way up to my street I have to get in the left lane, so I glanced over to my left and changed lanes and saw some lights through the trees, I didn’t think anything of it.  Now at this point I think I drove maybe 50 more feet and looked to my left and up saw some lights.  I saw two sets of lights in the air parallel to my car.  Three in one clump and three on the other, in the shape of a triangle.  One set about a football field away and the other up and in back of the first set about a football field and a half away but trailing behind the first set. Above and behind the first set of lights.  That is something I remembered today, another detail I didn’t remember.  There is a grocery store at that corner of that intersection PJ’s market I first thought the lights were coming from the store.  Then I realized that store is closed, and immediately I did a double take and didn’t take my eye off the lights.  Those lights weren’t coming from the store they were above the store and coming down they were moving.  Now remember I’m in the left turn lane driving maybe 10 MPH and I could not see what this was, only lights.  I didn’t put two and together.  That is until the first set of lights starting getting brighter and brighter they were blinding, they were so bright I couldn’t see what was behind those lights, what was this holy ((word deleted)).  My vision actually got a little blurry.  So I stopped my car I was about 10 ft.  from the intersection, I kept saying out loud what is this I have to watch this holy ((word deleted))) what is it. ((three words deleted))   what is this.  Don’t get out of your car just watch it and see what it is.  Because I wanted to get out but didn’t I didn’t know what this was.  But I wasn’t scared that’s the strange! part.  Now this thing is coming straight down, it lit up the whole intersection it was almost directly over my car and coming down and I’m watching it and just keeps getting brighter as it’s coming down.  Now this thing stops descending and I’m looking up at it maybe 150ft. in the air and to my left above the store and the lights are not in eyes anymore.  I can see it,  It’s round slighty domed shaped on top, not a radical dome a slightly rounded top.  I would have to say 70 to 100ft. in diameter and flat on the bottom. It’s hovering, directly across from me, but only for a couple of seconds then it starts to slowly move directly over my car and down, at first I couldn’t see what the bottom looked like because of the lights.  As this craft moved over my car two of the lights went over my car and were not in my eyes, and now I could the bottom of this thing about half of it.  It was flat and gray and it was not shiny it reminded me of the same material used on a fighter jet.  I’ve seen plenty of those I know what that looks like.  It cou! ld have been painted metal too.  Now it’s about 50ft. from the top of my car about 30ft. above the power lines I saw one landing gear perfectly, it was retracted to it’s belly, half white half metal and it had a tire on it I could see it, it was that close.  The one light was recessed into the belly like what would be in the ceiling in a home.  The craft was rotating as well as moving to my right.  It moved directly over my car.  It started moving further over my car.  So I pressed my face up against the window so I could see what it was doing.  Now I can only see the very edge of it so I leaned over my steering wheel to see what I can see above me.  I looked up and what I saw was a smaller craft, about 20ft. wide hovering in front of me and a little to the left across the street above the power lines it rotated in place and was now sideways to me.  I could see the windows they were blacked out, about a half dozen but they were small this was a smaller craft. The fuselage ran the whole length of the craft and stuck out the back end.  The craft was not completely round, round in the front and batwing shaped in the back and the fuselage hung out over the back it was round and came to a point.  If you look at a stingray that’s what it looked but not round in the back.  Also remember, the intersection is still lit up, the big one is still above me and I have no Idea about where the second set of lights went at the beginning of all this.  Ok so now the small craft is in front of me hovering sideways it flies toward the center of the intersection makes a left drops down to about 10 ft. above the road flying east towards Seattle.  And then the lights go out the intersection goes back to normal with the street lights on.  I’m fixated at this little craft flying directly in front of me down the street.  It flies for a couple of blocks and illuminates in a light red glow.  I’m absolutely amazed at this point I can’t believe what I’m seeing.  It’s glowing red and ju! st takes off faster than anything I have ever seen.  I can see Seattle and the water from where I am.  It flew over the water, left a green luminescent trail behind it over the water, I saw bright white flash over the mountains and it disappeared in probably a second or two. I saw no jet blast and heard no sound.  Picture this I’m in the middle of the road in the middle of night not one car not one person all by myself wondering what the ((word deleted)) just happened.  It took me about 10 seconds after it was all over to figure out what do.  I just stared straight ahead in disbelief  and looked up to my left.  I said time to go home and drove home.  Mike was home I couldn’t tell him I couldn’t tell anybody at that point. I was trying to comprehend what just happened.  The next couple of days were kind of strange.  I felt very alone, and kind of trapped.  I have been very confused in my own thoughts.  Carrying on a conversation has been very hard unless I’m talking about this and even then my thoughts wonder.  Since this happened I’m a little paranoid driving home at night and I’m wondering when they’re coming back.  Because they will be back.   To me that’s they’re take off point.  That’s not the first time they’ve launched from that point.  It was to precise, to fast and absolutely flawless.  And all of it lasted I would say at most from beginning to end maybe 25 seconds.  And that’s with me watching the small craft fly down the road.  How did they know to take off from there?  It’s their runway.  Like I said they’ll be back whether I see it or not is another story.  But somebody will.  Now it’s time for a dash cam.  I wish I would have had one.  So anyway I will end this right here.  I want you all to know I love you all very much and we’ll talk soon.",2019-09-19T00:00:00,47.512492746113985,-122.61571813471501

PD)) Mr. Josh Brinkley of Santa Fe, New Mexico/Northern New Mexico- Official Encounter Statement Sept. 01, 2019 -  My hunting partner, Danial Lucero of Santa Fe, New Mexico/Northern New Mexico- Official Encounter Statement Sept. 01, 2019 - My hunting partner, and I had been scouting Cerro De La Olla mountain in northern New Mexico for a couple days and were headed up to begin our elk hunt early on opening morning.   I left ((male 2 in a good spot near the top of the mountain and headed up a bit further to mine.  Around 9:30 a.m.,  after seeing no elk, I headed toward the small caldera on the peak of this mountain, which I know well.  As I approached this caldera, I glanced to my left and saw two, identical figures standing side by side, looking either at me or directly away from me. 	They stood on the other side of small oak trees or ""scrub oak"" so I could only see them from their waste up.  Naturally,  I thought I had run into a couple other hunters, but as I got closer to the edge of the caldera, I couldn't understand what I was looking at.  They were about 35-yards from me and I could see them well.  Their heads seemed bigger than a humans' and  they seemed taller than an average man.  I stepped down a small ledge, taking my eyes off them for a couple seconds.  When I looked back they were still there, with black torsos and a silver cat- eye shape in the middle of what would be their chests or backs.  Their heads seemed to be framed in by two half moon shapes.  The one on the right was all black, the left one was a shiny white.  I could see no eyes of any kind or facial features on either of them.  Compared to the scrub oak, they seemed to be approximatelty 7-feet tall. 	I repositioned on the other side of a bush, taking my eyes off of them for a few more seconds.  When I looked back, they were gone.  I was so close that I clould have talked to them.  I walked to my left,  then all around the bushes between us and the field near us, but the ""beings"" were nowhere in sight.  I'm a logical person so I chalked it up to being the tallest, most identical, alien-space-suit-looking, super-hikers I'd ever seen.  Needless to say, I was bothered and  I quickly left the area to find Daniel.  I reported to him that I'd seen (what I thought) were two hunters on the top of the caldera.  Later that day, I confessed to Daniel that what I saw didn't look like two hunters.  As odd as it sounded, I explained the details to him and that I thought I may have seen aliens.  I could tell he didn't know what to believe.  We seemed to laugh it off but it was on my mind all night. Sept. 02, 2019 - The next day, we got up early and went to a different part of the mountain for our morning hunt.  We walked for miles without seeing a single sign of elk or deer.  We got back to the Jeep around 2:30 p.m. and drove past camp, headed to the northeast side of the mountain to try our luck there.  We had been driving for about ten minutes on the road that works its way around the base of the mountain.   Suddenly, we spotted what seemed to be a huge tent-like structure in the field in front of us.  When we first spotted it, I estimate that we were about 1/2 mile away. 	The road was very dry, mostly smooth and winding, with some straight-aways, random tight turns, and rocky patches now and then.  Driving towards it, our speed varied from 15 to 40 mph.    The first thing I said to Daniel was, ""What the heck is that thing?"" and I remember pointing at it.  Daniel also saw it and expressed to me he had no idea what it was.  We watched it as we drove.  Seeing it, at first it looked like a huge circus tent: white in color with a black diamond shape on the top, near the point.  The left side of the ""tent"" stretched far out, about 5 times the length (or possibly width) of the main part and seemed to be about 1/3 the height (if you were looking at a fighter jet from the side, jet pointing to the left, you would see  the tail rudder sticking up on the right and the rest of the jet coming out to the left).  We were unable to see the bottom of the ""craft"" or ""structure"" due to the rolling hills and winding road.! I thought it looked like a movie set, possibly a huge catering tent or base camp.  We studied it for almost a minute. 	As we got closer, we estimated this ""tent"" to be at least 50-feet tall and between 150-250 feet long (or  wide).  Neither one of us were alarmed and again using my logic, I assumed I was looking at a building or something man-made.  Believe me when I say that my first thought was not , ""Hey look!  It's an alien ship.""  It didn't have many features and appeared to be mostly solid white.  I could see some shimmering, as if part of the ""stucture"" had a sheen to it, with the black point on the top.  As it was sitting out in a field, in a flat spot a bit lower than we were, we were unable to see the bottom of it. As we drove, would see most of the ""tent"" but then as the road dipped, we would see around just the top, then another dip, we could see all but the bottom of it.  We couldn't figure it out and I kept assuming it to be the movies.  As we approched the ""tent"" (about an 1/8 mile), I was wondering to myself about the possible explanations for this ""stucture"".   We dipped in the road again and as we came level, the ""tent"" had simply vanished in a matter of 3 seconds.   A structure the size of a small school had just disappeared.   There was no dust, no noise, no sign that it had ever been there. 	You can imagine the words coming out of our mouths... we could not believe it!  We looked all around but found nothing,  so I slowed down as we neared the place where the ""stucture"" had been.  Now we were speechless as Daniel and I kept looking back and forth at each other in shock.  How could something that big just disappear?  Both of us saw it and tracked it for quite a while during the car ride.  Both of us saw that it had disappeared.  We didn't know what to do.  We continued a short distance down the road, then I pulled over, staring up the road, and looking back and forth at Daniel.  Over and over we asked each other if that really had just happened.  My brain hurt.  We couldn't make any sense of it.  I felt a little numb.  We talked about what we'd just seen as we scanned the field for about an hour, but found nothing.  Frustrated and confused, we headed back to camp and even spent the next few days hunting...if hunting is what you want to call it.  For me, it was more like pacing around the mountain thinking about alien space ships.  We spent all of our time together questioning and talking about what we had seen, constantly asking each other if it was real and if it actually had disappeared. 	We knew the answers and they scared me.  My friend, Bill Fenstermaker, sent me a number to a UFO hotline.  When I finally called, I spoke with Mr. Davenport who was very helpful with directing us on what to do next.  On Friday, 09/06/2019, I called the Taos, NM, news office and spoke with Staci Matlock.  We drove into town and spoke with her in person.  She seemed very interested so I located on the map where this encounter took place and shared with her everything that I remembered.  I was a bit nervous telling our story, but I felt like it needed to be recorded.  I believe that the ""beings"" on the top of the mountain and the possible ""mother ship"" that we saw, were from another dimension.  Maybe they're from outer space, or maybe someone isn't telling us everything.  I am now a believer. Joshua  Brinkley September 17, 2019.  Do not edit without consent from Joshua Brinkley.

It looked like it came from where satellites would be (about that high up) and the brightness was as bright as the brightest star.  The next day I ask the same thing and AGAIN I saw 3 blinks in the sky but this time to the East. -	06/06/2019 – Around 3:10am I was outside on my back deck looking at the stars; I talked really quiet saying, “If there are any aliens up there please show me your space ship; Do something.”  To the East moving from South to North I saw a moving object light up for two seconds; I said, “Thank you; Please do it again.”  About 1 minute later I saw the same thing this time North-East moving in the same direction.  It was like what people who see UFO’s call a Power-Up, but very short as if they only wanted me to see them.  The object appeared to be about 1 mile away from me;  The light went from complete darkness to brightness, fading-in from small to large and fading-out from large to small;  Hold your thumb and index-finger ¼-inch apart and then hold your fingers against the sky and imagine a bright-light about 1 mile away at that size [That’s about how large the light was at its brightest];  And the shape of the light was more oval shaped being wider on the left and right sides. -	06/08/2019 – Around 2:50am I was on my deck looking at the stars asking the aliens to please show me something; I turned south-east and noticed 2 bright stars, one on top of the other; I thought to myself, where the heck did those 2 stars come from?  I never saw those stars there before; Every night the same stars are in the sky; I stared at those 2 stars for about 15 seconds and then they both slowly faded away together in about 15 seconds; A cloud would cover one first and then the other; These both faded away together.  06/09/2019 I looked at the sky all night from 12am to 3am and I never saw those 2 bright stars to the South; That confirms to me my experience yesterday was aliens that created those 2 bright stars to the South. -	06/27/2019 – Around 2:25am I was laying on my reclining chair looking at the stars and said “Show me something aliens” and eventually I saw a light moving from South to North looking over my house towards the North; I think it was a dim Power Up that lasted only 4 seconds; It appears to be the same object I saw 06/06/2019 at 3:10am that did a Power Up. -	07/03/2019 around 1:00am I was outside on my deck laying back in my chair looking at the stars; Within 5 minutes I saw something moving from North to South and light up for about 3 seconds; It was up where satellites are; The light wasn’t super bright, just bright enough for me to see clearly; The last time I was out there I asked my alien friends to please show me something moving from North to South because the last 3 times I saw things moving from South to North; This confirms to me something is listening to me up there.  About 5 days ago I saw the same object moving from South to North and it lit up [a light] 3 separate times just 2 seconds each time and in a row and that was it; That’s when I realized the last 3 times I saw something up there they are always going South to North and asked them to please do something from North to South next time [and that is what I saw tonight]. -	07/03/2019 around 3:00am - I had another experience; I went out around 3am and looked at the stars for 10 minutes; I went in and got my laser; I shot my laser up in the sky for 3 seconds a little East and then said… ok aliens, I put on a show for you; Now you put on a show for me; Within 1 minute I saw a blinking light START where I shined my laser for 3 seconds and the blinking light went North; I stood up out of my chair and looked over my roof and it blinked a few more times and then stopped, nothing more. -	07/04/2019 around 4:00am I asked the aliens to show me something and soon after straight above my head as I was laying back in my chair looking at the stars I saw a quick bright flash of light and that was it; Nothing more; I said Thank You, I saw that; The flash of light was 1/8-inch round and appeared to be about a mile or so in the sky. -	07/05/2019 around 3:30am I had just sat down to look at the stars and within 2 minutes looking South I saw an object do two slow flashes of light and that was it; I felt like it was my alien friends saying hi to me; It was not fireworks; Super quiet, warm, and clear sky. -	7/18/2019 around 12:45am I was looking at the stars laying back in my chair and I said “Aliens show me something please”; I saw 3 bright blinks way up in the sky slowly moving from North to South.  They answered me within a minute. -	7/22/2019 around 12:50am looking at the stars asking my alien friends to show me something; About 3 minutes after that I saw a light moving across the sky from North-East to South-West and then faded away during flight; It was about twice the size of a star, solid white light.  Clearly not a satellite because it faded out completely above me to the right [South a little]. -	7/23/2019 around 12:30am I shine my green laser into the sky for 3 seconds and say “Ok alien friends show me something”; About 3 minutes later I see a white light moving across the sky from North-West to South-East and then fades away not too long after it passes over me.  Around 4:00am I shined my green laser in the sky for a few seconds, waited, about 3 minutes after saw a light appear above and to the North-East as it was moving and then fade away within about 4 seconds; 2 minutes later it did it again. -	7/24/2019 around 1:00am I was laying down on my chair looking at the stars; I said, “Aliens, bring your ship down here”; Within about 3 minutes I saw a detailed light flying from South to North only about 500 feet above me; It was like a ripple of light, three u-shaped lights similar to this: ((( flying above me.  Then immediately after I see a light moving across the sky way up high like a satellite from North to South and it seemed to make a little curve as it was flying; As it passed over me it went a little further and then faded away completely [That lets me know it was not a satellite]; And as that light was moving the other light that was only 500 feet above me flew by again from North to South but this time dimmer. -	7/25/2019 around 3:50am I was laying on my chair looking at the stars, I looked South and saw an airplane flying from South-East to North-West about the size of an inch with solid and blinking lights; Then, much lower moving from South to North a random blinking bright white light went over me and seemed to go higher as it went North and seemed to fade out; Then 4 minutes later it came back from North to South blinking randomly a bright white light as it went South; I sat there another 20 minutes and didn’t see anything more.  About 20 minutes after that I saw what looked like a falling star but I don’t think it was because it was right above me falling from West to East like a firework and it appeared to start at that point. -	7/30/2019 around 4:00am I was looking at the stars [a cool night wrapped in a wool blanket] and I said “Come on alien friends, put on a show for me” and I saw a light [tiny like a star/satellite] moving above and in front of me from West to East a short distance and then faded out; Then I said “Come down here close to me about 50 feet”; Shortly after I saw a stream of light fly by from south to north in front of me; Then I said “Now come 10 feet from me”; Then I saw a light at the top corner of my house above my sliding glass door light up dimly and moved to get my attention making me look; I definitely know something is communicating with me [an alien, a light being, something]. -	8/1/2019 around 2:10am laying on my chair in a wool blanket on a cool night I was talking to the aliens asking them to take me to Hawaii and then above me flying fast from East to West at the top of a tall tree in my yard about 150 feet up a very intense about 8-inches wide yellow and green light smeared across the sky [Yellow in the middle with green on the outside edges]; The color was so intense against the night sky it reminded me of colored posters that glow with a black ultraviolet light . -	8/7/2019 around 3:30am; I haven’t had any alien/ufo experiences the past 3 or so times I’ve been outside looking at the stars; Tonight I said “If there are any high vibration/frequency aliens that can hear me and your intent is for my highest good and will help me raise my vibration/frequency show yourself to me now please”; And I saw a stream of light fly by me about 40 feet up just over the roof of my house moving from south to north [Like if you took an almost white red-hot piece of coal/wood and through it through the air and it flew at a straight line horizontal to the ground; It was mostly white but with a little red]. -	9/2/2019 A few days ago my parents saw their first UFO around 11:45pm; My mom was looking out her bedroom window and saw a square object hovering about 300 feet off the ground above the trees to the North-West; She made my dad come see it as well; It had multi-colored lights on the bottom; Then it slowly started to move; Then a bright white light flashed ON; And then it moved out of view.  Around 1:30am that same night my mom said she saw a round white circle to the North that looked the same as the moon looks in the day; She made my dad get up to look at it as well.",2019-09-19T00:00:00,45.0061,-93.1566

There is no possibility that it was a cloud, it was precise and had an exact shape.  I couldn't take an adequate picture, but I drew a picture of the approximate shape.  If it weren't buried In a pile of old files, I would post it.   However, the large structure wasn't the only thing that convinced me it had to be an alien origin.  In the center of the larger object it appeared a set of lights began moving to possibly open up a what I would assume to be a hangar type area?  And then a light appeared and began moving along the outer edges of the overall object very precisely.  Moving most likely at hundreds of miles an hour.  It would stop every so often and ""light up"" the area it looked as though it was repairing the hull of something for only fractions of a second to a second or two at most.  Every so often it would move much quicker between what I would call "" apparent repair points"" and changed directions as it went along the structure multiple times, with very precise movements.  The overall structure took up about 1/4-1/3 of the sky that was visible within our eyesight and leaning back to see as much as we could.

I got up and went outside with a pillow to lie down on our bench to get a good general view of the sky before the sunrise.  My feet were facing south, my left shoulder to the east coast (the sun was beginning to rise a bit). I caught the first meteor in the upper right quadrant of view…. It was orange in color and zipped the usual speed (1/4-1/2 second in length).  A few minutes later I saw the second…in the bottom left quadrant….same seed.  It was bright white in color.  I then noticed an airplane…flashing lights in the right, middle area of my general sight.  It was going the usual speed….and quite a bit slower in speed as the meteors….I do not recall if I heard it. Then (at the same time as the plane was flying from right to left in the middle of my vision), all of a sudden a white orb appeared to the left of mid-field.... out of nowhere.  It was a circle/ball of light….opaque in substance as best as I could tell with my eyes.  There were no clouds in the sky (except a long thin one that was at the bottom of my field of sight).  The orb was quite a bit larger than the meteors…..about the size of a red light when you are stopped about 4 cars back.  Best I could tell it was way over the tree line but below the height of the airplane.  It traveled south to north for about 5 full seconds and then just disappeared.  It was traveling at least 4 times as fast as the airplane, but at least 4 times slower than the meteors.

The small cumulus cloud I saw I estimate at 3000ft because 3300ft is the usual lowest altitude for Cumulus clouds, which the object passed through.  No way they were at 10,000ft. Using my clinometer, (I am a trained surveyor and forester, also a Navy veteran).  I calculated a 10-degree upward slope, at 45 degree azimuth, looking at the object. I immediately went inside the house to draw what I had seen. 10 miles out, towards Canada, is where I think it made a 90-degree turn, heading East.   This would coincidentally point it towards military bases in the area. At 10 miles, the calculated speed was 18,000 miles per hour!  (2 seconds and 10 miles away)  Also coincidence, close to escape velocity of 25,000mph.  Slowing down on landing approach?  It was in broad daylight and whatever it was, did not appear to be in trouble or care if anyone saw it.

The small cumulus cloud I saw I estimate at 3000ft because 3300ft is the usual lowest altitude for Cumulus clouds, which the object passed through.  No way they were at 10,000ft. Using my clinometer, (I am a trained surveyor and forester, also a Navy veteran).  I calculated a 10-degree upward slope, at 45 degree azimuth, looking at the object. I immediately went inside the house to draw what I had seen. 10 miles out, towards Canada, is where I think it made a 90-degree turn, heading East.   This would coincidentally point it towards military bases in the area. At 10 miles, the calculated speed was 18,000 miles per hour!  (2 seconds and 10 miles away)  Also coincidence, close to escape velocity of 25,000mph.  Slowing down on landing approach?  It was in broad daylight and whatever it was, did not appear to be in trouble or care if anyone saw it. I’m not an artist but this the shape of what I saw and the ‘shimmer’ around the flying object: a boomerang shape with a 15 degree back angle on the wings.  About double the size of the sun, using your thumb as a reference. Like you said Peter, I hope this is ours. ((END ADDENDUM))",2019-06-20T00:00:00,48.00258533333333,-123.39789600000002

I was turning my head left to right making the sky brighter and darker depending on how the lenses were polarized. During this time, I saw what I originally thought to be 5-6 birds flying from North-East to South-West pretty high up.  It looked like they might have been seagulls as I could make out darker areas in the front and back.  Not having my glasses, I removed the sunglasses to see if I could identity what kind of birds they were.  Once I took the polarized sunglasses off they completely dissapeared.  Put the sunglasses back on and they were back again! Then the ""birds"" passed above some clouds which were much, much higher and were temporarily hidden behind the clouds.  The clouds they went behind were either Stratocumulus or Altocumulus clouds (6500' to 20,000').  No way I would have been able to see small birds at that altitude.  They also appeared to be ""rolling"" as they flew by.  And they did fly by very fast.  This all happened withing a matter of 10-15 seconds.  They went from one horizon to the other, apparently at a greater altitude than I originally thought and were not visible to the naked eye.  It was quite unsettling.

My husband and I were driving on the New Jersey Turnpike that parallels Newark airport when we noticed what we thought might be a helicopter in the distance right near where the airplanes took off.  The airplane would’ve been in the line of traffic from departing airplanes. I was in the passenger seat and was admiring the take off of an airplane that had the star of David on its tail.  I assumed it was and Israeli airplane.  As the airplane reach the air its Wing dipped kind of abruptly.  I thought that it would be a bit scary to be a passenger inside that cabin.  For a split second I say a dot in the airspace near the aircraft but immediately dismissed it as a bird or an optical illusion. As airplane evened out and seemed to turn around its course.  My husband asked me if there was a helicopter in the air nearby he asked me:  “Was something happening over there?” (pointing to the left side of the road in the nearby airspace.  He was wondering if there was some sort of activity happening. I looked behind him out the window and saw a shiny metal (silver) round object.  I thought perhaps it could be a drone and said “don’t worry about it,  I think it might be a drone,” but then on second thought and look it was not shaped like a drone.  It was more shaped like a slightly squished  sphere.  That’s what my husband said he saw as well.  He said it looked more like a can in the sky but it was shiny metallic. I honestly thought maybe it was a drone but then I looked up what drones look like and this did not look anything like that.  There was no obvious wing or propeller of any sort. My biggest concern was having a drone, or an object like this, flying so close to the airplanes at the Newark airport.",2019-06-27T00:00:00,,
