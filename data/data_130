I noticed a light floating in the air, over the hill in front of me.  I observed the light as I was approaching the intersection and stopped there to open my camera and take a recording.  The object appeared to either be made of light, or to be producing light from one side of itself.  It was hard to determine if there was a mass behind the light.  I have taken frames from the video and it does appear to have something attached but it is faint/small/hard to make out compared to the light.  The object floated back and forth, only changing elevation slightly.  You can clearly see the light changing directions.  Reviewing the frames from the video, the light is continuously changing/adjusting. I stopped my recording when I was startled by a vehicle approaching from behind me.  I lost visibility shortly after that as I was in the foothills of the Rockies. When observing the video, at 1:27, a shooting star appears from the top left corner.  The star flies in and then stops suddenly straight down.  Milliseconds later, a small white orb can be seen floating off the ground.  I was not aware of the shooting star when I recorded the video.

It was moving unlike anything from nature or a human made craft.  It moved slowly in an organic curving pattern, sort of meandering back and forth, toward the sun then away.  It almost looked like a paper plate blowing in the wind, however it seemed way too high to be an object from Earth and the distance it was traveling in each motion was fairly long — way too far for an object to be blown back and forth I think.

NUFORC IS AWAITING WRITTEN REPORTS FROM ALL WITNESSES, AND THIS REPORT REMAINS IN QUESTION UNTIL RECEIPT OF THOSE FOLLOW-UP REPORTS.  THE FACTS PRESENTED HERE ARE SUBJECT TO AMENDMENT. At 1816 hrs. (PDT) on Tuesday, September 03, 2019, our Hotline received a call from an adult male, who described himself as a bow hunter, hunting for elk in the vicinity of Taos, New Mexico.  He said that the elk season for bow hunting had opened on Sunday, September 01, and that he was hunting with two other hunting partners. According to the source, on the first day of their hunt, two of the hunters witnessed a very strange looking structure, which at first, they thought was some type of building.  However, the area they were in was so remote that they didn't understand what a building would be doing in that area of the forest.   One of the witnesses estimated the craft to be not less than 100 feet in length; the other estimated the strange craft's length at not less than 200'. The witnesses did not get a photo of the structure.  They departed the area, but returned to the same location again the next day, September 02nd, to scan the area for any evidence that might be present at the site where the alleged object had been seen resting on, or near, the ground.  During this second visit to the area, the one witness who contacted the National UFO Reporting Center went on to recount that on September 02, he and one of the other partners witnessed two tall, very strange, alien-looking creatures, who were seen standing in the bowl of a small volcanic caldera. The one witness who telephoned the UFO Hotline stated that he would submit a report, upon returning home from his hunting trip, and that he would attempt to convince his two partners to submit reports as well. The individual who called the Hotline added that all three of the witnesses had been quite upset by the events they allegedly had witnessed, and that they were considering returning home early from their hunt. NUFORC was impressed with what we perceived to be the apparent sincerity of the caller during the telephone conversation with him.

Perhaps not a craft, but definitely unidentified. If anyone has an explanation please post. Unfortunately I have no pictures or video it just didn't occur to me, if anyone does I'd love to re-experience this as I've never seen anything like it. Lights were blazing across the sky for hours, it was  was a bit cloudy and at first glance you might assume these light were a laser sky show, someone having fun but I've never seen anything like it.  Most lasers, when pointed to the sky from the ground don't just appear in the sky, you can trace the laser to the ground.  But there was no hint of a source and this ""projection"" went quite literally horizon to horizon...quite a feat. As if it were projected from above the clouds. Now as for the lights themselves...several patterns were displayed.  The most striking was a double helix that again went horizon to horizon in one direction and the width maybe 15 to 20% of the sky.  After awhile the pattern changed to something that made me think of a visual representation of the doppler effect.  Two waves crashing over each other encompassing almost the entire sky!  And another a seemingly random cacophony of swirls chasing themselves around the sky.  Full disclosure, there WERE supposed to be northern lights this weekend, which is why we mostly dismissed it as a group.  And if it were only the last described chaotic sequence, i would leave it at that.  The lights weren't all that bright, relatively speaking, standing next to a very small campfire and you can't see them. However, there is NO WAY this was northern lights, it was way too structured. and as far as I can tell, through hours of Google, there is no skylight or machine that can effectively do this.  Especially legally, and this went on for hours in the middle of nowhere 30 miles from any city lights or venues. Of course, depending on how high these projections or perceived sources were, the area that this may have been visible could potentially be huge. Also, and perhaps unrelated, the clouds further up and to the south had consistent flares of purple light or lightning. Very dense, and completely silent.  There was no pattern to the effect.  I believe it was a rare lightning of some sort.  But maybe I'm wrong? So alot of things that skeptics can use to dismiss this I guess.  But there was definitely something wierd going on.  Everyone was amazed, a few of us who understand how things work are perplexed by what we saw... Anyone?  Ps zero drugs or alcohol were consumed that night.  At least by myself.",2019-09-06T00:00:00,42.3828,-85.957

I looked up and saw a yellowish / white light. The light went out and turned back on in a different spot. The flashes were several seconds apart and did not have a pattern. It was behind trees for about 2 flashes. The next flash it had moved quite a bit from left to right. The next flash it had gone back to the left but a different area of sky. The next two flashes is when my wife also noticed it and it moved from left to right with each flash but again had moved quite a bit of distance. The next flash it was back behind the trees all the way to the left close to where the 9 year old first noticed it. The next time it went off it was gone. The light did move while it was 'on' but was slow moving. When it went 'off' and turned back on it had moved extremely far compared to when the light was 'on'. Minute or so later we did see a plane come by and could see the significant difference between the plane lights and the one we had just witnessed.

I stargaze out there almost every night so I am well accustomed to airplanes, helicopters, shooting stars, and satellites sightings.  At first I thought his object was simply a bright satellite as it was tracking in a smooth slow trajectory up over my house in an area of sky where I usually spot satellites as they traverse at night. It was after about 10 seconds of observation that I witnessed the small bright object pause, then continue slowly, then pause and hover again.  This told me it was definitely not a satellite and had to be a craft of some sort.  It then continued forward but made a slow ""S"" shaped squiggle of its flight path unlike any airplane, drone, or helicopter would generally execute.  It paused once more and then began to get brighter.  I realized it was descending from a much higher altitude to a lower one.  It was not quite directly over me at this point but very near vertical as far as the angle at which I had to look up.  Once it got low enough I could distinctly see it was circular and convex on the bottom, perhaps a sphere, but possibly more flattened.  Color was black or dark gray from what I could make out.  The bright light was not on the bottom but rather pointing out horizontally from one side. I was a brilliant white/bluish hue and did not flicker or blink at all as an aircraft lights might.  No sound was audible from it. I observed the object hovering at this lower altitude of roughly 750-1000 feet up for about 5 minutes. I ran inside after that point to grab my camera.  It was still present when I returned but had ascended much higher. I attempted to get a picture but it was too hard to get a clear focus as it continued to ascend and then the light faded out suddenly and it was gone. I have been stargazing for years now and have never seen something I couldn't ID as I am familiar with all kinds of aircraft, satellites, and shooting stars that frequent the night sky. This was something very different and I cannot figure out what it was other than a definite flying object with a circular profile when viewed looking up from the ground.

It was about 20,000 feet in altitude. It had a flashing red light in the middle and two solid white lights at each point at the rear. The white lights created a reflection off the bottom of the craft. It was clearly a shinny black metallic surface. It was being escorted by two fighter jets. The jets had the standard FAA regulation lights. The jet to the left was at a higher altitude than the craft while the jet to the right was at the same altitude as the craft. They were flying due south. The craft was silent. The only noise came from the jets escorting it. I ran to the back door and shouted to my wife to come out. She came out and witnessed the craft as well. We took pictures but our cell phone did not capture anything other than the indistinguishable lights. We watched it as i! t flew beyond our field of vision toward the south. At arm's length, the craft was approximately 2 inches in length.  In comparison, the jets were about a quarter of an inch.

While beginning my exterior security rounds at 2:15am I noticed an unusually bright light in sky approaching very quickly in manner that was not typical of most planes & jets in sky. As it approached very near my direction at a very fast pace I noticed more details unusual about this object. I fumbled to get my cell phone for video but it was so fast I could only manage a quick photo after it passed me. The most unusual thing I noticed was how large & long the object appeared and that there was a haze in front of the light(s) that were at the tail end of the object. At first I only saw it as one light in sky. I thought for a moment it was coming right at me almost as if it saw me. Then in the sky about even with me slightly north (airport to south) it was not very high I noticed there were two lights in a vertical line one after the other and the distance between indicating a very long object, much longer then a typical jet. It clearly appeared as one object. I thought for a! moment perhaps a blimp. The haze was very distinctive and oddly visible in front of the lights. It had a translucent appearance almost as like an ""aura"" and was shaped like a cigar (or torpedo). It did not look at all like smoke or an exhaust trail and most odd was again the length of the haze forward of the two lights that were in very clear view behind the long shaped ""aura"" of the object that could not be seen. It appeared to be descending in the sky but in direction not typical of the other planes that land at nearby airport but further south of the sighted object. My photo does not show the haze only the two lights at tail end. Lastly there is a nearby airport to the south of this sighting. Minutes later a descending commercial jet in typical fashion even at night was very visible and distinctly heard as it descended for landing. The object I saw to the north was equally close enough to be heard and much larger & longer had me creeped out by the ee! ry silence.  I called local police shortly after returning from rounds to report sighting and find out if anyone else reported anything.

I was dozing in the rear passenger seat when one of the boys in the front seat spoke up saying, ‘Hey, I think that thing is following us’.  I woke up to see a bright light out the right side above the tree line pacing our car some distance away.  This was in the days before common helicopter usage.  We were all watching it, and it was making no sound or vibration as it got larger and closer to the car.  There were no houses, no lights, no traffic or other possible causes which caused us some concern.  We sped up and the light sped up.  We slowed way down and it slowed down with us.  We stopped and it stopped.  The driver then decided to turn the lights off and try to outrun it flying down the straight highway at 90 mph in the dark!  The light stayed right with us.  We reached some trees and he turned the headlights back on, slowed down to highway speed and suddenly the light sped off to the right and was gone.

In 1960, when I was a science junkie in Jr. High School, ((name deleted)) (my friend), his Father and I had a strange, inter-active ""ENCOUNTER"" that to this day remains unexplained.  My friend retired from the Air Force, and several years ago, we met in person after he retired as a career Air Traffic Controller.  Of course, the elephant in the room was our ""encounter"" when we were young teenagers in Avon Lake, Ohio. Our recollection was exactly the same of the event which occurred in the Summer of 1960 shortly after dark.  My friend and I were hanging out in his backyard when we noticed the 3 white lights hovering among the branches of one tree.  He went and asked his Father to join us.  What the three of us witnessed in Northern Ohio that night was 3 white “lights” hovering among the tree branches 8-10 feet above our heads.  They were within a foot or two of each other.  Their glow could be seen through the tree leaves directly beneath these ""white lights"".  They were about the size of large, round dinner plates and appeared to be almost flat.  There were no other light sources or beams of light in the backyard of my friend’s house.  Any other external light sources would have reflected off of the leaves of the tree. Now here is where it gets unbelievable........ A couple times I threw a small rock at one of these 3 ""lights"" and each time the one I aimed at moved to avoid being hit.  Due to the close spacing between these 3 lights, no human(s) operating a light source would have any way of knowing beforehand which light I was trying to hit, and only the light I was trying to hit moved out of the way each time, while the other two hovered without moving.  These “lights” continued to hover until the three of us finally went into our homes for the night. Weather was clear and in the 70’S  Residential area  Any explanation would be appreciated.

After almost 40 years I have enough information to finally make this encounter public.  Although there will still be questions, but the most interesting thing about this case is the ongoing bizarre encounters in this area of Oregon!  ""THE ENCOUNTER AT BLACK ROCK""  I had taken a brief time away from the USAF and my fire protection career and was back in my hometown of Salem, Oregon.  I had met up with a Navy veteran who was also a martial arts instructor.  As we both loved the outdoors and hunting, one cold morning in the fall of 1979 we headed to an area I used to hunt in the early 1970's, near Falls City, Oregon...an area called 'Black Rock'.  (Don't remember the exact month or day)   The morning was overcast and cool, some rain off an on.  I had my USAF field jacket on for warmth.  We took JC's vehicle and headed towards Falls City, Oregon, then west into the hills called Black Rock, which is about just a few miles from Falls City.  Not only did I know this area, I spent a few days in the summer at Camp Tapawingo in the late 1960's, part of a church camp, which was close to where we were hunting. Driving on Black Rock Road out of Falls City, we took a forrest road and it was dark probably 6am in the morning.  JC was driving and from my passenger window I could see the trees on a steep slope to the right as the sky was slowly getting lighter, but was still dark. No roads above us... then there it was ... a 'BRIGHT RED ORB' floating through the trees at a 45 degree angle from where we were! (See drawing with this report) I said to JC... ""What the hell is that""?  JC responded ""Probably another vehicle.""  I responded... ""There are no other roads up there!""  He slowed down, I rolled the window down as this light was moving slowly above the trees, estimated distance about 100 yards or more.  If I held up my thumb it was just barely cover the object.  (I now estimate the object was 25-35 feet in width)  The object was solid, glowing like a star and round.  No other objects were seen nor aircraft in the general area. There was no noise as it was floating in the same direction as we where driving.  There was no wind that day.  This was not a reflection from our vehicle off the clouds or someone else's vehicle because once we stopped, the object kept moving forward.  After a couple minutes of watching it, it faded into the clouds out of sight.  We were a little stunned and wondered what we just saw!  We headed on to a higher elevation, slowly the morning was getting lighter.  Still overcast we hunted an area going up hill, it was late morning or early afternoon.  JC was below me several hundred feet and I was walking a forest road uphill until I came to a green metal gate.  No signs, the gate was locked.  I turn around startled because I heard a vehicle coming up the road.  It got closer, a blue Dodge, it stopped and to my surprise two USAF Security Police get out of the vehicle. (See drawing with this report)  The driver was a Buck Sergeant and his passenger was an Airman First Class.  The A1C had an M16 and the driver had a pistol on his hip...   He yelled, ""YOU ARE IN A RESTRICTED AREA!"" I responded, ""Hey, guys, I am on your side and I have hunted this area for years... what's up with this?""  He responded again, ""You cannot be here its restricted!""  About that time JC came walking up behind them which made both of them nervous…  The sergeant had his h! and on his pistol and the airman kept watch on me!  As soon as JC came up, we were told we needed to vacate the area ASAP.  Now, JC was one that no one could take his weapon away from him!  I had an old British Infield .303; I don't remember JC's weapon and both of us unloaded our firearms at the request of the SP's and they asked us to get into the bed of the truck and were escorted back down the road.  We both sat there with wonder on our faces as the airman was with us in the bed of the truck.  The sergeant came upon JC's vehicle, we got out and a few words were said but I don't remember all that conversation.  They left, and JC and I looked at each other dumbfounded!  Reflecting back on that day... some points to bring up...  The USAF pickup was real, it had all the markings, goverment plate USAF on the doors, both airman had the correct badges, patches and dress for that period.  And both were armed.  So, why were they there?  A few months later, I would re-enlist back into the USAF and head to Colorado, and this incident faded into my memory. A little history of this area;  Via Wikipedia...

Controlled by: United States Air Force Garrison: 689th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron Built: 1957 In use: 1957-1979  The nearest USAF installation to Falls City, Oregon was Mt. Hebo which is 64 miles plus or minus NNW of Falls City, Oregon, and it was confirmed by an airman stationed there, the complex had no SECURITY POLICE on site. Excerpts from my journal 27 May 1995; made trip to Falls City, Black Rock and Valsetz area. ""Spoke with several locals familiar with area about military vehicles, all same conclusion ""some weird"" stuff is going on up and around Black Rock & Valsetz as noted by a station attendant-several transport-hauling goods and equipment seen going to Black Rock last summer -Hummers and large trucks. Most locals believe there is a radar site, but with all the base closures-Mt. Hebo and other bases U.S. and worldwide, why would a small radar site remain open this long.  With NORAD having advanced system that can protect our perimeter 1000 miles out from our coastlines and 15,000 up into space, it's unconceivable that a radar site would still be needed in this locale. More from my journal 28 May 1995... Back to Falls City to go up Black Rock Road.  On 27 May went about 10 miles, road very trecherous, not for an auto, unstable at places.  Unable to locate spot I was at 16 years ago when confronted by SP's. Spoke with a local firefighter, said USAF and DOD are at radar site. Lots of road equipment and construction going on.  Warned that road is unstable, and there were gates locking us out from area.  Because of treacherous roads on canyons and construction going on warned not to go up there without a 4x4.  Suggested getting map from BLM on hiking trails and local roads. Conversation with 'JC' after close to 40 years after finding him on Facebook. 5 Febuary 2019 Question to JC;  ""It was 1980 or so... you and I went hunting near Falls City... I had my .303 WEARING my USAF field jacket... driving early up a forest service road we look to the right in a tree line and see a RED glowing ball floating.  Wow... we said... maybe a tail light of another Hunter on a road above us... but no roads higher than what we were.  Later in the day I come across  a green metal gate... next thing I know two USAF SECURITY POLICE are drawing down on me with M16s... then you come walking up the road...  Do you remember that?  Your old roommate and karate student...  How the hell are ya JC?"" (NOTE; later during our phone conversation it is determined it was the fall of 1979)  6 Febuary 2019  Response from JC;  ""Hey RG I had forgotten that but I remember now it was up by Black Rock as I recall and I remember the guy that was reaching for his pistol was nervous yeah I remember that we never did figure out what that red glowing ball was.""  Later that week, JC called me and we spent about an hour catching up as it had been close to 40 years since we had seen oneanother.  JC told me he had been battleing colon cancer the last several months…  We talked more about the Black Rock encounter to fill in some gaps.  I found it odd to myself, that for the last several months my old friend had been on my mind... he had been struggling to stay alive, but he beat the illness.  We both vowed to stay in touch. In March 2019 I saw a post on a Facebook Group for Cold War veterans about an individual being stationed at USAF Mt. Hebo Radar installation in Oregon.  I contacted him right away.  Below is our conversaton. 11 March 2019 My Question;  ""AK... this is a long shot question... I see you were at MT. HEBO in my home state or Oregon... fall of 1979 I was home on leave hunting and had an incident near BLACK ROCK in that vicinity.  Were you in security police during your time at Hebo 1979-1980... curious,  because my story is straight out of the X-Files... my career was fire protection in the USAF.""  22 March, 2019  Response from AK;  ""No, I was in ground radio. After everyone else left the ground radio guys were all that was left.  So when I left in 1980 there were only 5 left.""  24 March 2019 My Question; ""Thanks for getting back on this.  Were there any Security Police assigned to that facility when you were there?  If not, I wonder where the two we encountered at Black Rock came from.  Basically what happened is that I and a Navy vet buddy encountered a large 'red glowing ball of light' hovering above the tree line early in the morning.""  ""It was not another vehicle as there were no roads above us. We both were stunned by the object.  Later while we were hunting, I came across a green metal gate and a USAF vehicle pulled up two SP's got out, one with M16 and the other hand on his pistol and my buddy was walking up the road behind them.  They told us 'YOU ARE IN A RESTRICTED AREA!.  I said I have hunted this area since 1972... They escorted us out of the area in the back of the pickup, ...That was it.  It's been 40 years and I finally found my buddy JC who was there with me to verify the event.  So my question, if these SP's were not from Hebo, where were they from, what was that red object and why was that area RESTRICTED?  The plates, the SP badges everything said they were real USAF personnel.   Anything you can add to this would be helpful.  Thanks!  24 March 2019 Response from AK;  ""I wonder if this happened before I got there.  I didn't get there until August of 79. I don't remember any SP's especially after most of the site closed.  We moved the GATR site to one of the radar towers after they moved the radar equipment.  Until I got out, for the last six months, there were only 5 of us.""   My response and question;  ""Thanks for the info.  As I said, our incident was fall of 1979.  So the big mystery now is where did these security police come from?  Conclusion:  During that fall of 1979, there were only 3 USAF installations in Oregon. Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls, Portland Air National Guard Base and the small unit at Mt. Hebo Radar Site. So, where did these Security Police come from?  Were they investigating the RED ORB we saw, or was their presence something totally different?  With numerous locals there in Falls City and neighboring towns all saying that military vehicles have been seen in that general area of Falls City, Black Rock and even Valsetz (an old logging town dismantled in the mid 1980s after Boise Cascade bought the land there.)  Why were military in that general area from 1979 to the time of my last visit in 1995?  Again, Mt. Hebo Radar Site closed in 1980.  Last, the big queston is… ""What is really going on in that area of BLACK ROCK?  It's a mystery, and maybe another visit is due! ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by Mr. Ron Wright, of Oregon.

This event occurred the summer of 1981 near the end of May.  I was at an end-of-school party after my senior year.  (To clarify, as a teetotaler I was in no way impaired.)  I and a small group of people were sitting out on an uncovered patio about 75 feet from the main house making small talk and enjoying the quiet sounds of the summer night.  It was full-on dark and the moon was either low to the horizon or waning because I do not recall seeing it.  The house on the north side of town was far enough out to be removed from any light pollution providing an amazing view of a cloudless, star-filled night sky. I was in a lawn chair facing east.  Most of the group walked back to the house while I and one other person remained.  There was no wind that night, and the house was far enough away, so except for the crickets, frogs and other subtle noises, it was very quiet.

The bright light, the size of a very bright star continued on its course straight north, moving fast enough to be easily picked out in the vast field of stars.  In about 30 seconds it moved steadily to the north horizon and briefly stopped only to reverse course!  This really got our attention because satellites don’t do this!

I looked and saw what was about as tall as a 30 story building just sitting 100 yards from us in a cut cornfield.  It was about as wide as as a football field or so.  I looked at reports of this same ufo in the database it made me want to report my sighting.  The only difference is this craft was hovering with no lights.  It had windows running all down the left side like a tall building.  I also could see coming out right side a cone shaped metallic booster looking object like on our space shuttles.  It had little bit steam coming  out of it like it was a vent instead of being a rocket for propulsion. I also could see at the top what l swear looked like a head with bulls horns or something, a emblem of some kind.  It scared my dad so bad that when I ran towards it to get closer for a better look he screamed  at me to stop and wait for him go first to see what hell had landed in our field.  He finally caught me and led the way when all sudden it vanished and was gone.  We walked back then but to this day I wish I had gone on out there because I think still to this day it was still there it just cloaked itself.  I thought so much over years of this and my dad still doesn't have any explanations  either.We lived in perfect place I later thought for something  to land away out by ourselves 100 acres of land on a  dead end road no other houses would be able see this but ours.I stumbled  on this website hoping find others that have seen my ufo or one like it.If you look at rectangle ufo sightings the one I saw is described 30 storys high or so and width of football field with windows up and down it like a building  is described more than once.Im so glad I was able to read those reports that this thing has been seen all over and is REAL.It feels good to be able get my story on here too,I have looked in fi! elds and up in clouds all these years hoping see it again but ! have not I swear on my life and my father would too on that this happened one late evening in late 80s and I have never forgot it or been able to explain it but I feel now for sure after reading about people reporting the same ufo in detail, mine just was not lit up or could I see people in the windows like some other reports of this same ufo.

My first thought was that it was some sort of freaky heat lightening.  I told my friend to check it out and he looked up but the sky was dark again.  When it happened a second time, I realized it was not heat lightening and had no idea what it was.  The sky was dark, then suddenly I saw several lights that formed a vertical rectangle—but not a perfect one.   The lights were visible for a few seconds, during which time several pulses of electricity zapped from one side of the rectangle to the other sporadically and simultaneously.  Then the sky went dark.  My friend confirmed that it was definitely not lightening.  It happened again several seconds later, only this time it happened slightly lower in the sky and a little to the left of the first two pulses.  The next time it happened it was even lower and more to the left, but in an arc from the initial sighting.  We weren’t sure what it was or what to do so we kept watching.  After several more appearances, it was 90 degrees from the initial sighting and just above the trees, then lower than the trees, then all we could see was a patch of pulsing light through the trees where it had landed.  Now terrified, we grabbed our belongings and I headed into the house as my friend drove out of my driveway.  I shut the lights and stayed away from the windows hoping I did not have any surprise visitors.  At 2:30 I went to bed.

Then I opened the moonroof of my truck and I was finally able to see it.  Shortly after my son saw it as well. It looked like a large circular fireball hovering over a distant city somewhere west of us in NJ.  It was about as high as a plane would be flying.  The appearance of the ball seemed like a glowing orange fiery light and it seemed like it had some type of aura.  My wife’s first thought was that it was a plane on fire.

Once we got in the middle of the football field, we were surrounded by figures that kept fading in and out of our vision.  I couldn’t make out any faces, but they were a dark tannish dirt color.  Some were tall and some were short and a bit fatter.  The shorter ones were still taller than me and I’m 5’5.   We kind of stood in the center of them like we couldn’t move for about 5 seconds and then we bolted toward the gate (It was the only area that the aliens weren’t covering).  We didn’t stop running until we got to the street.  My girlfriend first told me what she saw and it is exactly what I saw.  I also completely forgot about the entire experience for a few years, until I had a dream about those aliens.  Can you give me any closure at all?   At the time, I believed but wasn’t educated in it, so I didn’t take note of losing time or anything.  Closure would be amazing… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)",2019-07-12T00:00:00,47.03031595092024,-122.89693098159509

The more I got to thinking about it, I decided to look up someone to report it to.  It appears the Air Force on longer takes reports, but I found your website in the process.  Rather than calling this a UFO, I would have to call it just a plain UO for “Unidentified Occurance”.  To this day, this remains the most unexplainable thing that I’ve ever witnessed.  I guess what I’m hoping to gain out of reporting this is to hear there was more than one person who witnessed the same thing. On Wednesday, November 26, 2014, at about 8:00 AM, my wife and I were traveling west bound on I-10 near Jennings, LA.  Unfortunately, my wife was asleep, which means I was the only one to witness it.  As I remember, it was cool weather with a perfectly clear blue sky. The best way to describe what I saw would be a hole in the sky that closed in on itself and disappeared.  From what I can remember, the hole was not symmetrical, but of an oval shape with somewhat of a jagged boarder.  The inner part of the hole was a pinkish color which was a definite contrast to the surrounding blue sky.  The outer border was very distinct like an extremely bright light breaking through a crack between the blue sky and the pinkish color of the inner part.  It took me a few seconds to comprehend what I was looking at when I finally started telling my wife to wake up.  By the time she opened her eyes and I was able to direct her to what I was looking at, the hole disappeared.  It’s hard for me to describe a size on it since it was in the sky, but I would say it was like looking at a nonsymmetrical oval roughly 1-3/4” long by about 1-1/2” high at a distance of about 12 to 14 inches from my face.  In other words, it wasn’t taking up very much space in the sky.  When it disappeared, it was as though it sucked itself into nothing until it was gone.  I would say it wasn’t any more than about 10 seconds from the time I first saw it until it disappeared.",2019-07-12T00:00:00,30.2547,-92.6759

I know it will be hard to believe but I know I saw it and now there have been other sitings I will report individually.  I have been an amateur astronomer since 1994. I have an 8” Dobsonion telescope.  I took it to a friends house to look at Jupiter, Andromeda, etc.  I cannot remember the exact date, so I am guessing. I grew up in the USAF and love planes and aircraft of all types.  I watched every Apollo mission as a kid.  I have seen hundreds of launches! I have flown hundreds of times all over the world.  I am an avid sky watcher.  I started seriously learning astronomy in 1994 to assist with my sailing certifications.  I have spent hundreds of hours watching the skies at night at different altitudes, locations, and conditions.  I have seen hundreds, probably thousands, of meteors, satellites, planes, helicopters, etc.  I can quickly identify a planet or constellation.  My friends and me were outside on their deck. It was a beautiful and clear-as-a-bell night.  No moon.  Minimal light pollution.  My friend asked, where is Jupiter?  I looked up to get oriented.  I looked over the peek of my friend's house and saw the usual comparatively large, slightly yellowish, non-twinkling dot of light that is Jupiter. We have all seen it hundreds of times.  I knew it was out that night because I had already consulted my constellation software and noted objects, locations and times.  However, I was not 100% sure this was Jupiter because I looked up knowing it was out and knew I would see it quickly.  I assumed it was Jupiter because it LOOKED LIKE JUPITER ALWAYS DID!   I pointed up and started to say “there it is” but before I made a sound, “Jupiter” moved to the right from a stand still, did a U-turn and took off.  Hold your thumb up to the sky at arm's length.  It moved to the right about half a thumb nail.  When it made a u-turn, it dropped down about 1/4inch and moved about two inches to the left and disappeared. There was no dimming of the light as it “flew away”.  It did accelerate.  It appeared exactly the same as Jupiter in size and light intensity and characteristics.  It did not appear to be in earth's atmosphere but rather, to me, it seemed to be in low earth orbit or higher. I said, in a fading volume voice, “did anyone see that”?  The only response I received was “what did you say”?  I had goose-bumps and felt weak suddenly.  To myself “Uhm, Jupiter flew away.  Did you really see that? Yes, I did see that.  Are you sure you saw that? Yes, I am sure.  Was it a bug?  I wish it was. Where is Jupiter?”  I frantically looked around until I found the REAL Jupiter.  I could not talk and did my best to hide it.  I never mentioned it again.  It scared the hell out of me because nothing I knew of, in my experience, could do what I just saw so clearly.  I had never seen a UFO before and was very skeptical because I could always identify what I saw from the many databases of flights and fly overs of all types of aircraft, space debris, meteors, etc.  I spun my telescope around and locked in to Jupiter as fast as I could.  I was shaking but I found it.  I was so relieved when I saw the yellowish planet with its four large moons in my sight.  OMG!  I took a year of astronomy online at Ohio State.  I have had physics, chemistry, biology, lots of math and am very aware of critical thinking and the scientific method.  I did some quick and rough calculations when I got home.  I guesstimated its possible altitude, speed and distance.  The most conservative number I came up with was that it pulled too many G’s for any life form to survive, when it did it’s u-turn, and it sped away at a minimum of 200,000 mph.  I started laughing (I was alone). I threw my pencil down and tore up the paper I was writing on, into as many pieces as possible and threw it away.  No one will ever believe this!  There must be an explanation. I cannot find one. Now what?  Sometimes, I cannot get this out of my head.  I think about it often.  I don’t know what to do with it.",2019-07-12T00:00:00,39.0429,-122.9158

When I got my things and was trying to leave, I noticed a big bright light right over the treeline in front of our house.  At first it was a couple lights strung out into a horizontal line, I thought it was just a plane in the distance.  My sister was walking with me out the door when we both stopped to watch the plane fly over because theres a small airport behind our house.  After a minute or so the lights didn't seem to be getting closer and then began getting brighter and the string of lights swayed loosely from left to right like it was hung from a string.  The lights would pulsate with brightness, each light seems to have the strength of a cluster of football stadium lights.  They were so bright but didn't seem to be shining on anything.  Then, the lights began to move around, seemingly ""adjusting"" themselves.  They'd stack on top of each other and fold in and out, move around.  There were about four lights that we saw and they'd flicker on and off.  They appear to be hovering, tilting or teetering in place, they'd clump and then the next second be in a linear position.  My sister and I were both very confused and waited for the flying object to get closer.  It felt like forever until it finally steered around a tree down our street and right over our neighbors house.  When it started getting closer to us, some of the light started flashing red and blue, so my sister assumed it was some sort of police drone.. but it was as big as, of not bigger than a family van.  When it was close, it was close enough for me to be able to hypothetically throw a rock at it and successfully hit it.  It got so close to us. The shape of the vehicle is hard to describe...  The body was a sort of flattened sphere and had two pill shaped ""turbines"" on either side.  From what I saw, it was a polished black color.  There seemed t! o be a sort of have around it, and made me second guess how we! ll my ey es were seeing.  What surrounded it was a type of hazy fog of some sort, but barely noticeable since it was dark out.  The only sound I remember hearing is a light strange whirring.  No helicopter blade sounds, no engine sounds, no revving or propeller, nothing. Just a quiet deep whirring.  I've Googled big drones and police drones, nothing near matches what my sister and I saw.

I am guessing that was January 31st, 2018.  A friend and I decided to look at the blood moon with my telescope.  We went to a very dark location about 2500’ altitude.  It was a perfect night for viewing.  We had turned away from the moon and were leaning up against my car and talking.  I am always watching the sky at night.  Even when I am talking.  I was looking southeast at approximately approximately 5’ from the horizon, if you put a measuring device at arm's length.  I saw a white light appear from nowhere.  It increased in intensity and size to the equivalent of Jupiter, if Jupiter was white.  It lasted 2-3 seconds, and it was done.  It did not move or leave a trail or make a sound.  It was a pulse of light.  It did not appear to be in the atmosphere of earth.  It seemed to be quit far away, beyond our solar system.  I watched the sky for a long time and did not see it again.  I looked ahead in all directions looking for a! path or trail.  I went back to the same spot many nights looking for it again.  I have not seen it since. I waited a couple of minutes and asked my friend, who was standing with me, if he “saw anything weird tonight”.  He said he just saw a flash of light. Without telling him anything, I asked him to describe it to me.  His description was the exact same as mine.  Thank god!  I’m not insane or maybe both of us are!  My first thought was that it could be a pulsar.  I cannot remember if pulsars emit light in the human viewable spectrum.  I have had physics, chemistry, biology, math, etc in college.  I took a year of astronomy online from Ohio State.  I’ve been an amateur astronomer for many years and have been an avid sky watcher spending hundreds of hours looking up from high altitudes and excellent locations.  I have learned a lot about what flys around up there.  I know a meteor from a satellite from a plane from a bug!  I never saw this before!  It left no trail.  Nothing visible.  I think it was probably a type of pulse from a star going through some type of energy emission.  I just do not know which one yet.  If you have any ideas, please let me know.

In June, 1971, I was living with my family in Hope Ranch, below the La Cumbre Country Club hill.  I woke up at 1:00 a.m., and looked out my bedroom window towards the hill and the starry night sky above the hill.  That's when I saw what looked like four hazy white circular lights fly quickly over that area of night sky and out towards the ocean.  If you hold your right arm and hand straight out in front of you, then tilt your arm and hand 30 degrees to the left (tuck your thumb in), the four hazy white circular lights were about the size (and location relative to each other) of your right hand fingertips.  They were equally spaced in a perfect slanted line, like the right half of a V-shape (including the center point of the V being at the lower left).  Their spacing didn't change.  The lights flew by many times faster than any airplane or satellite I'd ever seen.  Could not have been spotlights because they didn't act like typical spotlights (no moving around or twirling, no spotlight beams).  The lights made no sound as they flew over.  Saw no evidence of anything going on at the country club at that time.  Using Google Earth, I've checked the lights' flight path relative to my former home's location and the location of the country club.   Conclusion: the lights were moving in a southeast direction, which means they were coming from the direction of Vandenberg AFB.  They may have flown over Vandenberg AFB, considering how fast they were going. Have not seen anything like that since, as of 05/03/19.

It was ((male #1)) turn to drive, as we were heading Northeast on River Road.  ((male #1)) thought he saw a light and stopped the car; he thought it might have been the police and as they did not have their drivers license yet.  I couldn't see anything, but since I was the only one with a license, he told me that I better drive for a while just to be safe. I left the passenger side and walked around the back of the car while ((male #1)) and ((male #2)) slid over to the middle and right side passenger seats.  When I opened the driver's door, that's when I noticed the glowing white sphere on the paved road, above the road center line, 20 feet from the front of the car.  It seemed to be about one foot or more in diameter, hovering one yard above the road for about five to eight seconds.  It was very bright.  I looked in through the driver's door at my friends.  They were both in shock, with their mouths wide open.  I called to them twice and they would not respond.  I then turned back to what, I now call the, ""Intelligent Light Sphere.""  It then moved higher above the road and in a wave formation over an eight foot ditch, parallel to the road.  Along the ditch there was a stand of birch trees and the Sphere, with silent, fluid movement, flew beside them and found an opening. It easily flew through the opening traveling at five to ten, miles per hour.  It then descended to about one yard above a recently harvested cornfield where the cut corn stalks lay angular from the harvester.  It stayed in that position for a few more seconds and then again, in a wave formation, started to move up the Fraser Valley toward Hope, B.C.  It then accelerated and a split second later, quietly, zipped out of sight, toward space at tremendous speed!  It was just so cool!  I felt like it was saying to me, ""Look what I can do!""  My two friends and I were, obviously very excited over this encounter with this Intelligent Light Sphere. The thing that really sticks out in my mind, is how the Sphere looked when it left. Just as it started to move, it entered into a unique wave formation.  As it accelerated, it appeared to change it's wavelength and it maintained this wave formation until its very high speed made it difficult to see anything but a streak of light.  The wave formation, at speed, was like a sine or cosine wave with a wavelength of about 500 feet and amplitude of about fifty feet, approximately. I feel, what this ""Intelligent Light Sphere"" was saying is; ""If humans want to travel faster than they can now, they have to enter a wave formation when in flight"".

I'm not sure of the exact date but it was around the middle of October 1993. When nearing the city of Bowling Green I happened to notice a large round ball shaped object high in the sky.  It was SE of the city, very shiny like chrome and looked perfectly round. I remember the Sun glinted off the object to produce a very bright glint of light as if it were reflecting from a mirror.  At first I thought it could possibly be the front or back side of a blimp or a hot air balloon and I found myself paying more attention to the object than I was the road. I pulled off to the side of the roadway and exited my car.  I remember the Sun was to the right of the object and I shaded it from my eyes with my hand to get a better view. It must have been around 2 or 3 PM. Another driver pulled off the roadway as well. He had also spotted the object and was curious as to what it could be.  We watched the object for 10 to 15 minutes.  It was stationary and again still perfectly round.  We talked about it as we watched and a lot of the conversation was about what it could be.  We wondered why others didn't notice it or seem to care enough to even stop and take a look.  We both felt the object was a perfectly round ball shape, and shiny, though we did not feel it to be a blimp or hot air balloon. The sighting ended when the object went straight up at an incredible speed and vanished thru the clouds.  That movement was the shocking factor of the entire sighting.  It was incredibly fast and went from being stationary a few thousand feet above the ground to completely out of sight within 2 or 3 seconds. I have no way of determining the exact size of the object but it wasn't small.  It was several thousand feet in the air when it was stationary and was plainly visible.  By comparison at the distance viewed it was about the size of a dime from our perspective.  It must have been very large, much larger than a hot air balloon or blimp. I don't know what it was I saw. I do know the movement and acceleration was impossible.  I am an Air force Veteran and have viewed the capabilities of most of our aircraft in flight.  This object moved away at a speed that is not possible.  The only comforting thought is that I was not alone in seeing this. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, The object appeared to be about the size of a dime held at arms length. It did not appear as large as the Sun, though I never looked directly at the Sun to make a size comparison, but the object was very large.  I’ve never seen anything like it before or since.   Another thing is the distance.  I can’t be sure how near or far away I was from the object, as I was not directly beneath it.  I can make a fairly accurate ballpark guess that it was at 10,000 to 12,000 feet altitude though.  I’m really not into UFOs but I did want to get this on record as my health is not what it used to be.  I know others must have seen it that day and hopefully the report will encourage them to come forward. Thanks and Best, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2019-05-09T00:00:00,37.0327077294686,-86.41964444444444

Seeing is Believing:  Sighting Over Texas Coastline.,Portland,TX,2019-01-04T23:45:00,formation,2.5 minutes,"Occurred : 1/4/2019 23:45  (Entered as : 01/04/2019 23:45) Reported: 7/9/2019 10:25:54 AM 10:25 Posted: 7/12/2019 Location: Portland, TX Shape: Formation Duration:2.5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/147/S147440.html,"Seeing is Believing:  Sighting Over Texas Coastline. I had recently started star gazing often at night because of a high occurrence of shooting stars in the area and sometimes in the early morning hours I would see satellites or space debris reflecting through the air.  Recently Trump had threatened his nuclear weapon button was bigger in response to North Korea Nuclear tension via Twitter so my assumption for a while for what I had viewed that night was it was a defense test or Space-X Rocket Launch from the Brownsville, TX, location.  I did not report this incident initially, as coming from a military family and having been educated in Mechanical Engineering, I assumed what I saw was a missile defense deflection test in preparation for any foreign nuclear attack. I walked outside and looked around the sky trying to allow my eyes to adjust to the darkness which would allow me to see stars and satellites easier as sometimes being next to a larger city the stars can be harder to locate.  The night sky was clear enough from cloud coverage for me to be able to locate stars in any direction.  About 2 minutes after being outside I noticed a group of 3 stars around 72 degrees east that were brighter than when my head had panned that direction previously.  Now visually fixated on these objects, I noticed that the objects were tracking NE in regards to my position and phone compass.  Being the large pessimist I am, I tried to downplay what I was seeing and assumed them to be air planes of some type.  But there were no strobe lights or jet sounds so I thought these to be space debris for a moment.  As a few seconds go by, I realize that it seems as if these equidistant 3 white orb objects are traveling in triangle formation.  There roughly at abou! t 35 degrees upwards in relation to my point of view.  Only about 10 or 15 seconds into the ordeal I made a split second decision not to go grab my phone (stupid) in a selfish act to keep watching the event unfold as I had never seen anything like this before but being someone well versed in mathematics and engineering was convincing myself with logical thinking what I was seeing was nothing to be excited about.  Calmly, I watched at about 45 seconds into the entire event as a middle orb seemed to appear out of thin air.  The objects began to track back towards the eastward direction slowly but changing directions simultaneously with each other moments after the arrival of the new orb.  Remaining equidistant to the new object the three whitish orbs slowly started de-accelerating to a full stop in coordination with the new orb the air.  Levitating there for a few more moments as the event reached the 1 minute mark.  The original 3 orb objects at this time started moving around as i! f they were trying to push this new orb that appeared by directing themselves underneath the new orb.  The original orbs were starting to move around the new orb erratically unlike anything I have ever seen before. Zig Zag patterns is the best description but staying equidistant from the new orb object.  At this time I noticed strobe lights of airplanes coming from a local air force base heading towards the objects coming from the Southeast direction at 116 degrees.  As the jets made it to around 75 degree east track the new orb surrounded by the original moving orbs started to glow orange slowly.  Over a period of 20 seconds the new orb grew to be larger and larger and seemed to gain luminosity as bright as the sun in the night sky but only in that area of the sky.  It looked like an atmospheric re-entry of a large object but the other objects around it seemed to speed up during this process.  The orb toward the right of formation shot off faster than I have ever seen anything travel in my entire life.  It covered around 6 inches of sky in less than! a 1 second span.  I assumed this object was traveling mach 5 or 6 but there was no explosion or sounds.  All I could hear were the jets at this time that were now approaching it within my range of view and most definitely theirs.  It was obvious these jets were tracking these objects.  The orb that traveled away from the formation went like a chord through a circle in regards to my visible atmosphere.  In less mathematical descriptive terms, the object was like if you were to have shot a bullet through the top portion of an orange.  The object was moving so fast it almost looked as a shooting star would have in regards to speed but this object was more gathered and had no comet tail or sparks.  The new glowing orb faded and each orb slowly one by one flickered/disappeared from plain site.  Whether these objects just traveled beyond the atmosphere slowly or not..they just vanished. After not being able to confirm that there was a space x launch and others in the area reported seeing the same thing I took it upon myself to report it.  As a credible witness soon to earn a degree in Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in both Mathematics and Psychology… What I saw is definitely artificial. I would assume at this time it is advanced defensive or just raw technology possessed by the United States Government being it was so closely after the nuclear arms arguments.  This is why I did not report it for a while but now I realize if it is an adversary that has the technology.  These objects are being reported around US military bases frequently.  Reports like this might be useful into tracking the origin.  Regardless of my opinions..it does not change the visual event that occurred.  So I decided to come forward with the report even though people usually are shunned for this type of thing.",2019-07-12T00:00:00,27.8923,-97.3187

When out the right side of my peripheral vision I saw this object hovering in the sky.   I watched it as it moved into view of my camera, then towards the helicopter, before it sped away at what looked like lightning speeds.  Now, I know some skeptics are going to say, ""It could have been a laser light source,"" but that helicopter was at least a mile away from my house at the furthest part of its circular pattern.  What kind of laser light would I be able to see from standing on my porch approximately a mile or so away?  Who would have such a powerful mechanism to shine into the sky where it would be visible to others for miles?  Look how that object moves.  It is definitely an unexplained flying object hovering over South Los Angeles.  Hell, for all I know, that might be why that helicopter was in the air.

For a very split second we both thought firework because it the 4th and all but then quickly realized it didn’t have a smoke tail, no immediate implosion or noises made like it could have been a firework- it was absolutely silent where we were at this moment because we had the radio off and windows down.  The best way to explain or reference how high this sphere was in the sky, was that it was just above the distant tree line (10 or less miles out I’d say) but close enough to looked pretty large and to be able to see the sphere shape to it from the bright glow.  We both realized we have never ever seen a tower where this sphere was and it was definitely bigger than a blinking red tower light in the semi short distance it was from us and this was entirely way too bright to not have noticed something that obvious the hundreds of times we’ve driven this route home.  The sphere’s motion was pretty stagnant, did not obviously flash- it had veils of transparency from its glow but nothing could be seen indefinitely from where we were, solid but a beautiful bright inbetween tones of red & orange glow in color.  We passed through some dense tree area trying to figure out what we just saw & my husband saw it through the trees but it looked further away and smaller in size. We attempted to turn at the bottom of the hill (Rt. 50) to try and follow it but half way down the road we hadn’t caught any sight of it and thought it would have disappeared by the time we could get to a good clearing. Neither of us have ever seen something that beautifully bright before. We tried to think of everything possible that it could have been and rationally there is nothing to justify it. The video of the woman in SC or NC who recorded the red sphere in the sky (Dece! mber of 2018, I believe)  is exactly what we saw and she liter! ally exp lained and described the same exact thing we saw to an identical tee.

Also this orb changes color from blue to white which is also how we know it isn't a sidewalk light.  We have curtains that come up half way on the kitchen window and this is definitely moving up and down and left and right.  I believe we are being spied on. Also I see a larger orb sometimes more than one higher in the sky and it changes color from white to red at times and also it changes shape into a Cross (Christian Cross) also these orbs emit small objects at times and seem to be able to build haze or fog around them as to not be seen and I don't know what to think about these things.  These are such  unusual kinds of sightings and my health has been affected negatively since them that I thought I had best report these sightings which still continue.  The orbs overhead have been happening for a while unlike the other small orb sightings.  Also I have seen some small orbs of light in my house a couple of times.

Around 2.10 pm I saw a triangular object rise over the horizon on the northern side of the beach (airport side) and shoot vertically into a cloud.  The cloud was relatively small and the object didnt fly out on the other side of the cloud.  I told my wife who was siting alongside me what i just witnessed and both of us eagerly kept observing the cloud hoping to see the triangular object fly out.  As we were trying to spot the object fly out again, a second similar triangular object shot out of the north horizon and disappeared in the same cloud vertically at a very high speed. since the airport is in the backdrop, I remember seeing a commercial airline take off around the same point in the horizon (norther part of the beach) much slowly as compared to the speed of these objects which atleast seemed to be atleast 5X times the speed of the airline. Both my and wife couldnt believe what we saw.  I had my camera wit! h me that fished after the second object entered the cloud and started panning the horizon to spot them.  After 5 mins or so, I saw two figher jets circling in the distance over the mountains and the clouds trying to look for something.  I was able to take pictures of these jets which were possibly scrambled from the base nearby.  The jets were twin engine/ tail jets and couldnt in my mind be mistaken with the objects I saw earlier.  Another thing that was peculiar, that if the commercial airline jet that took off from the airport at 400+ miles an hour speed and these objects easily flew at 5 times plus speed, that implies that they flew supersonic but we didn't hear them making any sound.",2019-07-12T00:00:00,,

It appeared to be very distant, maybe over the James River, but high in the atmosphere.  Two more of these orbs appeared from the same location and they each went in separate locations until they formed a large triangle in the sky.   From our perspective they seemed to be travelling slowly, but considering the distance and likely height of the orbs, they were probably moving quickly.  Then one by one the lights vanished as the orange lights slowly faded out – from a sizable orange ball to a pin of light to nothing - they vanished slowly. Then, just as the fireworks began a fourth orb appeared from the same location and traveled like the first three until it was obscured by the fireworks display.  After the fireworks, we stayed in the cemetery until midnight and did not observe more of the phenomenon.",2019-07-12T00:00:00,37.00484489795918,-76.66419183673469

It was over the trees, rotating very slowly and following a non-linear path, I tried to get a clear view of it, however, it was further away by the time I did.  I estimate the it was about 200 feet above the trees and about 200-300 wide.  It was not a dronex not a blimp, not a helicopter or plane.  It moved too slowly and meandered.  I don't know what it was.  It had lights on the 3 points which is what gave away its shape and size. I was unable to take photos, unfortunately.  I do not wish to be contacted.

It would be visible and then disappear, I watched it do that 3 times.  At first, he thought it was something related to the fireworks that I was seeing, but he realized it was not fireworks when the light came back and moving fast, from south to north then abruptly making a sharp turn and headed east, then it just vanished.  This happened a couple of times before I had the presence of mind to get my phone and try to capture it on video.  Literally the moment I started to video it, it vanished. Waited and waited, but it didn't come back. Until after the next weird ass thing happened.  As I'm looking for this light, I see an enormous blue laser light cutting across the sky.  I've never seen s laser that was that big, nor have I seen a blue one.  My house is situated on a hill overlooking the valley, the orangish light had been over the mount! ains to the west and the laser came from the north (either from Colville Mountain or very close).  The laser beam was very big and the intensity was so strong, it stretched across the sky. It was very brief, though.  I have talked to a third person who also witnessed the laser, but from another location.  After the laser went out, I noticed the orangish light was back, but now it was in the vicinity of where I had seen the laser.  Once again, it flew along the tree line, back and forth a few times before it disappeared.  I did get some video of what was happening, the quality is horrible (I am not an accomplished camera operator), but the light I was seeing is distinguishable.  You can even see when it changes to an almost red color.  Forgive the fact that my ex is totally bombed and providing non-stop commentary in the back ground :)  I really do not know what I saw, only that it did not look like anything I've ever seen before.",2019-07-12T00:00:00,48.6791,-117.7527

It caught my attention because the usual object first appeared to be perfectly still and did not show any characteristics associated with a helicopter.   Later, it moved south at what appeared to be an extraordinarily high rate of speed.   When it accelerated, I believe I heard a faint, very low frequency rumbling.  Otherwise, there was no sound associated with the object. The object featured three lights in a triangular pattern.  When I looked at the object through binoculars, I could clearly see that one of the lights was a steady red and two were alternating between green and red.  The alternation occurred on a regular basis changing roughly once per second.  There was no evidence of landing lights on the aircraft, and through the binoculars I could make out what appeared to be a triangle. Yes, this was on the Fourth of July. But this clearly was not any kind of firework.  I also found it odd that if this was a research aircraft of some type, that it would be flying on a night when so many people would be looking up towards the sky.  10pm is a typical time for fireworks displays in this area.

I’m pretty sure it was the highest point on the way up the mountain.  Out of nowhere we see this light in the distance that just looks like a normal light in the distance.  I give an assumption that it’s either a planet or just a really bright star.  However, as we look an just talk about what possible planet it might be we see an aircraft with a pretty obvious chemtrail goin in the direction of the light.  As that aircraft grew closer to the light it started to do something strange. The closer the aircraft got to the light it started to do a weird shift in brightness.  As if though the light saw what was approaching.  The light started to shift in some sort of pattern like a kind of blinking.  That’s when me and my friend thought something was strange.  We were joking around because we thought it was normal but then it started to pulsate an slowly vanished. The longer I looked to the sky the less I could believe what just happened.  As quickly as we realized the light was there it vanished.  The only thing I could think of that may have obstructed our view was a very small cloud.  However even then I waited to see if this light may return. It did not.  My eyes couldn’t believe what happened.  The light was there one second and as if it was spinning it faded slowly away. It honestly frightened me to the point where I need to reassure myself multiple times that I was not the only person who saw it.  I’m an avid hiker an I’ve seen the skies many times to know the difference between a normality and a anomaly.

My girlfriend and I were up at Castle Lake, located above the city of Mount Shasta, we go swimming and hiking up there in the summer and we were curious to see if it was still frozen over from the winter, and if the trails were clear of snow yet.  There’s still a lot of snow pack so you can’t get up above the lake very easily, and most everybody had cleared out of there by the time the sun went down.  As far as I know we were the last people to leave, and it was almost dark.   As we were walking back from the shore towards our car, we heard a weird, low humming sound coming from the lake.  It was the kind of thing you might not even normally hear, except there was no noise or people or wind up there at all when it started.  We turned around and saw a flashing multi-colored sphere of light hovering about 50 feet off the lake, further towards the back of the lake near the cliff wall.   We both saw it at the same time and wondered if it was some kind of flare hanging in the air, but it didn’t look fiery and it wasn’t smoking.   My friend was wondering if it was the light of a climber on the cliffs, but we could see light strobing off of the sphere and flashing against the cliff wall so it was definitely hovering in the air and throwing off light around it.   It lasted for only a few seconds then it vanished again, along with the humming sound.  We weren’t freaked out by it or anything, but we’re still not sure what we saw that evening.

Around 8:50-8:55 there were LOTS of lights falling from the sky. I was driving with my fiancé from Cottonwood to Mesa, and I believe I was on the 101, traveling south, somewhere between the 51, and the 202. I noticed the first, and brightest, of all of the objects, and quickly woke my fiancé so that he could see it as well. At first, it looked like a huge falling star/firework (bright flaming rock with a sparkling tail), but it lasted a really long time (around 20 seconds), and it’s flight pattern was weird. It was falling straight down for about 6 seconds, then shot right back up (2-3 seconds), fell down again in a zigzag pattern (2-3 seconds), shot straight up again (2-3 seconds), then made a hard right turn in the middle of the sky and travelled a little ways (about 3-4 seconds) before burning out. I told my fiancé to grab his phone and start filming, and he tried but said that the camera wasn’t picking them up very well, but I kept insisting that he try. Seconds after the first light disappeared, it was followed by another similar light that originated out of nowhere, high in the sky, but must have been at least 3 miles apart as the crow flies. Then another one appeared in the opposite direction.  Then another miles apart, and so on. No rhyme or reason to where they appeared.  There must have been at least six of these lights  back to back, and all popping up in random places, miles apart. . Meanwhile, there were LOTS of planes/jets that looked like they were circling the area. At first (for a very brief second), I was thinking that maybe they were some sort of flare… but flares last for a while (about 5-10 minutes), and hover in one place before burning out. I’ve seen plenty of flares from the Gila Bend Air Force while living in Ajo, and those flares are completely different than the lights that we saw.  Even the colors differ. The last one was really strange. It dropped down SUPER low (about fifty feet above some houses), and then, before hitting the ground, it leveled out, turned right, and coasted above the houses for a few seconds until it fizzled out. That would have been the perfect one to catch on camera, but unfortunately, when my fiancé tried to view the video afterwards, he realized he hadn’t been filming whatsoever. I did some research, and there were similar reports in Florida the day before, and they were saying that it could possibly be remnants of a Chinese rocket…  But since when did remnants have a mind of their own and move up, down, and sideways?

I would estimate it flew at 5000 ! mph, given that I know jets fly around 500 mph. It was the fastest thing I had ever seen in flight.

The wind was strong and gusty W to E.  A friend and I were in his hot tub looking at the stars finding the Big and Little Dipper.  We turned our gaze towards the north star and as we did we both saw two moving lights spaced about 6-8 feet apart. The lights were 200-300' off the ground over the subdivision and flying into the strong wind at approximately 65km/h.  There was no audible noise from where we were watching in the hot tub, although the hot tub motor was running and it was very windy.  The lights flew about 350’ from our right (E) across in front of us to out left (W) and then did a hard 180° turn, flew back about 20’, blinked and disappeared. I am a commercial helicopter pilot and know of no aircraft that can fly like that besides a drone.  We sat and discussed that possibility for a while, hoping it would reappear.  We concluded that the movement of the two lights was too smooth and uniform to be two separate drones, too fast, agile and quiet to be one large one (6-8’ wide drone??) and the speed at which it turned 180° was possible for racing drones but not for anything of size.  Other possibilities we considered was some sort of light phenomenon, thinking maybe it was headlights hitting moisture in the air in just the right way, but it was very clear and cool with no moisture in the air. We eliminated theories until we had two possibilities left… something we don't know exists or an ET UFO.",2019-05-09T00:00:00,,

SOURCE OF ACTIVITY:  On April 27, 2019, at approximately 0351 hours in the City of Bullhead City, Arizona (Mohave County)  I REDACTED: I stepped out of my residence pedestrian door facing a southern direction to “get some air” while observing the nightly lit shy with a clear and unobstructed view, I  immediately observed a unknown aerial object moving at a extremely fast pace. OBSERVATION:  I REDACTED stepped out of my residence pedestrian door which faces a southern direction, to “get some air” immediately observed a faint then at times brightly orange colored object, that I first believed was a star, then begin to move in a very fast rate of speed. Based on my digital calibrated cell phone compass, the unknown orange colored object was observed from my point of view in a south southeastern direction at 100 to 120 degrees, based on digital compass bearing heading, while I was standing outside my residence pedestrian door in a southern direction. The unknown object appeared to be moving in a northern direction from a south southeastern point of view. The unknown object was at first extremely faint or not visible while I was spontaneously looking at the night sky. The unknown object then became more visibly lit, appearing orange in color, yet mixed but not twinkling like a star, but more steady or a type of solid visible light. The unknown object begin to originally appear “faint” then more illuminated, and was moving like a distant slow moving plane, then instantaneously accelerate in speed, nothing like a fast moving plane or normal type of plate or jet I would anticipate as adult with common sense, articulation, judgment and intelligent observational analysis with 2020 eye vision / healthy normal eyes and overall health. The unknown object speeded up so abruptly in a northern direction, that it quickly dissipated into the darkly night lit sky, lasting for approximately five (5) to ten (10) seconds in observation. I then stood outside for approximately ten (10) minutes to further observe the “calculated” trajectory based on time and observation, of the unknown object would further appear or make itself visible, and met with negative results, while fully observing the clear night sky from north to northeastern to south southeastern observation. ADDITIONAL/DISPOSITION OF OBSERVATIONAL ANALYSIS:  I have lived in major metropolitan city for most of my life and I am aware that ‘light pollution” obstructs a lot of stars in the night sky.  After living in Bullhead City, Arizona, a somewhat rural town of about 40,000 in population, the light pollution I would say with common sense is 1/10th of that compared to a major metropolitan city which would be the full 10th scale of light population. No doubt, what I observed was anything I can explain or understand.  The only reason I was able to observe such a fascinating occurrence, is because the light pollution is at a minimal. I hope wherever this report / log is submitted to, serves the individual or organization well, thank you.",2019-05-09T00:00:00,35.084078494623654,-114.56282311827957

About twenty minutes into our firework-watching, we noticed what looked like very distant, bronze-toned lights which were flying in perfect unison—making what looked like an enlongated triangle formation.  There were four lights, total.  One light made the point of the enlongated triangle, then two more lights, perfectly spaced, which made the bottom of the “triangle” formation.  There was, at a distance behind the formation, one more bronze-ish toned light.  This light was exactly like the other three, but appeared to fly at its own pace, and was not part of the formation.  The “triangle” and independent light were headed southbound and seemed to be traveling at a slow rate, almost at times appearing at a stand still.  The triangle formation stayed that shape for about five minutes.  The light that h! ad been trailing behind independently suddenly “dashed” off at such a fast rate that the only way to describe it is to compare it with a shooting star.  But between six sober, adult eye witnesses, it can be said, without a doubt, that the bronze-colored light that zoomed off was not a shooting star.  It was definitely a light on some sort of flying craft that had “shot off” in the opposite direction it had been traveling, and then completely disappeared from sight. The other three lights disappeared from sight as well only seconds afterwards, but unlike the independent light that had been trailing, these just “went out” and nothing more of them was seen. These lights were not bright white like search helicopter lights, and they were not white, nor blinking, like those seen at night on commercial aircraft.  These lights were small, bronze, round in shape, and stayed constantly on until their sudden disappearance from the night sky.

The synced activity was that these crafts appeared to be Zooming back-and-forth very high speed in the sky.  They were going from a south to north direction and then from north to south.  Then they would go from west to east and then east to west, and then they would circle amidst each other.  Then these crafts would fly directly over our head and then zoom back down towards a southerly direction.  The following day we saw numerous reports online that many others had seen the same lights in our area.  These crafts and lights made no noise.  They were very quiet.

They darted around one would move right then the other, sometimes they would be really close to each other and then one would move to the right so fast it made my eyes blur.

I will say that the short video I tried to get of these 2 moving things did not show them, but showed two small flashing lights hovering all around them.

I went up on my pool deck which is elevated approximately 10 feet off the ground which gives a better view through the bare branched trees.  My gazing began looking up towards the zenith as I often begin in this manner to allow my peripheral vision to take in all directions anything that might draw my attention, e.g. shooting star, meteor activity and any anomaly. Ten minutes into gazing and listening to the sounds of peepers in the wetland farm tract to the northwest, is when I noticed two red and white flickering objects out of the corner of my eye coming from my west (Lake Champlain/Cumberland Head, NY, transiting east.)  I continued to watch these 2 points of red and white flickering objects and determined they couldn’t be small planes because there was no sound and they weren’t moving in a linear way but seemed to be buoyant and bobbing going slightly up and down and then hovering and circling one another as they did this heading slowly east.  I could clearly see the flickering lights even through a slight haze-the distance I would guesstimate to be a mile maybe 2 from my deck.  This continued on for several minutes roughly 15.  The objects were just above the tree line not in the sky and to my eye they would have been near the shoreline by Pearl Bay by East Shore Rd. I have seen these lights once before in the same vicinity during the last month of April but never paid too much notice, just made a mental note of their unusual flickering.  It definitely got my attention last night almost to the point of nearly driving my car the short distance of a mile and a half to (the public beach) on East Shore North to observe more, but didn’t in the end.",2019-05-09T00:00:00,44.71970000000001,-73.3027

I had spent the night on the boat and was almost ready to go back to the dock.  I was about ¼ mile north of the 4 lane launch ramp at the north end of the lake.  At 8:30 am I was drifting with a slight breeze from the north, pushing me toward the dock to the south.  I had a line in the water, fishing, with a large brimmed hat and polarized sunglasses.  The weather was sunny and clear, typical Arizona. I glanced up, looking south, and noticed what I at first thought might be some spiderwebs caught between my fishing rods, which were mounted on either side of the console.  Whatever it was, it was diffuse, and somewhat hard to distinguish, much like the sun looks glinting off spiderwebs.  Its relative size was about that of a full moon, about the size of an aspirin tablet at arm's length.  It was completely stationary.  After a few seconds I thought what I was seeing might be some reflection hitting my sunglasses.  I moved my head up and down, trying to determine where a reflection might be coming from.  At that moment the object moved on a level horizontal path toward the west, out of my visual range, in a fraction of a second.  The acceleration was so great that by the time the object had moved to the right edge of my vision, I could no longer track it.  At that moment I realized what I had witnessed.  There were some people in kayaks, a couple of guys fishing and some other boats to the north and east of my position. The environment was quiet, and I heard absolutely nothing that could be associated with the object – it was completely silent. I would estimate that it was about 40 degrees in elevation and on a bearing of 180 to 200 degrees. Object size and distance were impossible to determine. The object appeared somewhat like two slightly elongated top hamburger buns, with the bottom bun inverted. There was a slight darker band separating the top and bottom sections.

My dad and I were driving as I noticed 3 bright white “things” flying in a triangle formation.  At first I figured they were planes, but their flight pattern was inconsistent, almost as if they were hovering around or flying like birds.   So then I assumed maybe they were birds.  But I see birds flying around everyday and they just weren’t the same.  They looked too big to be birds, and were SO shiny, and moved to fast to quickly (at speed of planes w/ flight of birds).   When I first saw them I’d say they may have been 7-10 miles down the road (if looking up) then within the 3 minutes were 20-30 miles away (give or take).  They would all shine extremely bright, but then all at the same time would fade and disappear into an almost translucent state.  Then they would shine again extremely bright, and turn translucent again.  This happened 3-4 times and was consistent.   Their flight pattern was in perfect triangle formation, but at one point they slowed down, almost to a stop and rotated around one another, then kept going back in their perfect triangular shape.   They continued on and disappeared from sight.   My dad also saw them but not for as long as I did.  Though he also had no explanation for it.  We talked about it for a while, trying to come up with what it could have been, and we think either ufo or some sort of government exercise with something we don’t know about.  I’ve seen a lot of birds and a lot of planes, but this just didn’t fit.  It was weird!!  Unfortunately, I didn’t get a video..  I know that’s a big part of legitimacy, but I didn’t want to miss anything for myself.   I just want to share this experience so that if anyone else saw this, they know they aren’t the only ones who did.",2019-05-09T00:00:00,39.9583,-85.9988

On the evening of Monday, May 6th, in Staunton, Virginia, at around 10:36 pm, I took my dog outside my house (in the backyard) for his final evening constitutional.  My backyard faces North / Northwest, (towards Bridgewater and Harrisonburg, VA) and it was a clear night and I could see the usual evening stars. As I waited, I glanced above the house directly behind mine (about 40 yards away, uphill). Over the roof, I saw what looked like the letter A without the connecting line in the middle hovering above the house.  I looked up the name of this shape and it is called a Chevron (an inverted V).  The shape seemed to be an equilateral triangle with only the right and left sides lit at equal intervals.  The shape was about 1/6 or 1/7 the size of the roofline. I could not gauge how far away the actual object was, but know my eyesight would preclude an object that was too far away.  I did not have my glasses on (I am nearsighted).  I just figured it was a plane in the distance because the multi-colored lights twinkled independently of each other. As I stood still and tried to make sense of what I was seeing, I noticed that the actual object was not entirely stationary.  It would move upwards a bit, then hover for about 30 seconds or so, then move a bit to the right, and then hover for about 30 seconds or so.  Then move back to the center and hover, then down to the left and hover.  The movements were smooth, repetitive, and in a subtle pattern.  It reminded me of an intricate dance centered in one area.   After about 2 minutes, I realized that it if the object were a helicopter, I would have been able to hear it.  It was quiet outside, and the object was no smaller or larger than it had been minutes before.  No planes would have still been the same size, or would be hovering.  Goodness!  I became more focused on what I what seeing.  I could see the center top and both bottom lights were white and flickering, rather than flashing.   From the bottom (right to left) the lights were subtly various colors: white, blue, red, yellow, white (center top), greenish, yellow, blue, and white (left).  It was if all the lights were really white, but every once in a while, colors were rotated in with the white, at an independent speed from the other lights.   I moved my head back and forth to determine if maybe I was seeing light through tree limbs or branches, and that is why it appeared to dance, but that did not make a difference. The A-shaped thing was subtly moving, and it made me happy, dancing like that.  I realized it wasn’t anything I could explain away. Even though there were tall evergreens and trees nearby, they did not come between the object and me. I ran inside my house (with the dog) to grab my cell phone (charging in the kitchen), and took it back outside to video.  I stood there videoing the object for about 2 minutes – and during that whole time I could see the object with my eyes, but the IPhone which normally takes excellent videos, showed nothing.  I tried again, and the videos came up black, with me talking and black screen, only. I ran back inside, this time I turned off all exterior lights (garage and porch) the dog came with all three of my cats, this time, and I ran back out to try again.  I spoke as I videoed again, and again, I could see the A object clearly, but the camera didn’t seem to record anything.  The object was still dancing and flickering.  I took 3 more videos.  After about 9 minutes of witnessing the object I noted that all lights seemed to be attached (it seemed like one object, not many) as they stayed equidistant the entire time.  The experience was very peaceful and happy.  When I looked down, my 3 cats and 1 dog were all standing or sitting quietly by me.  Anyone with cats and a 2 yr.-old dog knows this feline behavior never happens.  I took 5 videos in total, and all the videos have me talking with a blank/black screen with no images at all. I ran back inside the house, all the animals followed me, and I grabbed my glasses. I left the critters inside and ran back outside in the dark.  This time the object was nowhere to be found.  There was suddenly white cloud cover where the object had been, and a few clouds that seemed luminescent with a slight glow.  I don’t know where the clouds came from?  The rest of the sky was clear. I went back inside for the dog one and took him back outside one final time and he started running in the yard, in circles like a crazy thing (which he can do when he gets excited).  This darting around is hard on a leash holder.  I kept looking up but saw nothing else interesting. The dog kept running to and for in a spastic way, and I suddenly felt a little unnerved.  Why was he crazy like that?  I moved back inside, locked all the doors, and checked on the animals.  They were fine.  I did not go out again.",2019-05-09T00:00:00,38.13703786407767,-79.06304077669903

Close-up sighting of flying saucer.  This story was told me by my landlord whom I have known for 15 years.  He is a very stable individual that owns a small business. In the course of conversation the subject of UFOs came up and he swore that he saw one close up in June 1972.  He said he is sure of the month and year because he had a brand new Plymouth Duster.  This sighting occurred in Torrington, Ct. at the intersection of East Main St. and Torringford West St..   He said it was a Sunday morning around 8:30am as he was heading for work at a bowling alley located on East Main.  He was 20 years old at the time.  He was stopped at a stop light facing west.  On the right is a small brick building which has been there for years and remains today, surrounded by several small trees.  He looked up and was amazed to see a disk shaped object hovering just above the trees.  He said his first thought was, ""I am REALLY looking at a flying saucer!""  The object was the classic UFO shape, he said it looked like an inverted dinner plate, flat on the bottom, with a raised dome on the top.  He estimated it was 20-30 feet in diameter.  It was a solid rust or bronze color, no lights, and hovered motionless just above the trees, and made no sound.   It was no more than 100 feet away from his car.  He was fascinated by this object.  He put his car in neutral and got out to look more closely, but the object suddenly either vanished or shot off so quickly that it seemed to just disappear.   He went to work and told some co-workers who all laughed at him.  He said that to this day, every time he drives past this spot, which is nearly every day, he still looks above the little brick building where he saw a real flying saucer.  He said it made him a believer.  I have emailed a photo of the exact location of this sighting to you. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) He couldn't remember exactly, but looking at an old calendar, it was most likely the 11th which was Sunday.  He was certain it was Sunday, as he was headed to work at a bowling alley that closed a few years ago, but was in Torrington for many years.  The reason I say that is that I showed him an account on your site dated 6/10/72 that occurred in Millerton, N.Y. and Sharon, Ct., which is about 15 miles west of Torrington as the crow flies.  Many people reported a UFO on that date according to the account.  He was certain it was June 1972, but not certain of the exact date.  My landlord is a very sober individual, and he actually held his hand up and said, ""I swear on the Bible I saw a flying saucer"".  I have spoken to him several times since then, he is a great guy.  As for the photo, the trees surrounding that little brick building were much shorter then, this UFO was no more that 50 feet high.  He still looks at that spot every time he passes it.  I hope this was helpful.  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",2019-05-14T00:00:00,41.8394,-73.1255

We were approaching  the first mccleary exit, traveling northbound on the freeway, when I could suddenly see small white lights zooming around the sky  on the right hand side of the freeway. It seems like it was only 3 lights at first.  We started driving slower even down to 10 mph on the freeway.  We were afraid and trying to understand what was happening.  Suddenly another “strip of lights"" appeared and were doing the same squiggly moves in the sky, Almost like figure eights, as they seemed to be following one another.  We looked toward the ground for strobes coming from that direction.  In case it were people using some type of strobe lights or something like that.  But there weren’t any.  The area below the lights was just brush and trees.  I don’t believe that there are any houses right directly below this location, even to this day. The lights seemed to be in a snake like configuration as they zoomed about extremely fast.  They were also completely white lights.  The most being maybe 6-8 lights in total.  I can’t even guess to say what size that they were.  I don’t believe that they were very large though. I turned off of the freeway to go into McCleary and we thought that they  had disappeared because  when we were looking behind us we no longer could see them.  But as we came to the stop sign, we saw the  lights again strait above us through the sunroof.  They stretched strait across in a strait line directly above my car.  Then they just lifted away and were gone.  I honestly can’t even say that they “lifted away.’  They were just gone.  No noise.  No ship-like appearance.  Just lights. It was something neither of us had experienced before.  We were both extremely frightened.  And both of us afraid for me to even drive back home.

Once outside, all quiet, plenty of stars out, no moon I saw what at first looked like a typical satellite until the behavior did not act like a satellite which usually is a constant movement with a constant illuminessensce going across the sky. As the thought of this particular sighting seemed odd and unusual, it is remembered.  The object was as high as a satellite, much higher than jets or so it appeared so due to no outline of the object could be seen.  It was not a shooting star either. All quiet outside while looking straight up, this object all of a sudden when bright for like a solid 4 to 5 seconds and held its brighness and as it was holding its brightness the object DID NOT MOVE at all.  Then the object dimmed out slowly and DID NOT MOVE.  Then the object went from dim to bright again for 4 to 5 seconds and DID NOT MOVE. This pattern repeated itself three times and then stopped. I always wondered what it could possibly be, but really, what kind of information would anyone know on this type of behavior, not to mention the responses of ""crazy,"" so really I have kept it to myself.

The bottom two lights were approximately 40 degrees above the horizon and separated by approximately 8 inches.  The top of the triangle was approximately 60-65 degrees higher than the two lower lights thus forming a triangle.  The amber/orange lights were brighter and larger than any stars that I would usually see in my western sky and looked to be about as large as a commercial airplanes landing lights at 2 miles out. As I watched the lower bottom light (south) blinked off leaving the bottom northerly and top lights. I recorded these lights with my iPhone’s video.  While viewing the remaining two lights the bottom (north) light flickered out leaving the top light.  The lights were stationary and did not visibly move in any direction and I couldn’t tell how far or high they were in the nights sky. I did not hear anything unusual as well. After about a minute the top light flickered out leaving the sky dark. I went into my house, quickly coming back outside and I noticed one light again in the sky and recorded for 28 seconds as it flickered and blinked out.  I pulled a pair of binoculars out of my truck to watch this light as well, hoping to see more.

We found another that looked like the first, holding still in the sky, across from the first.  Distance is hard to judge, but they seemed fairly far apart.  While watching the second still light group, another one that blinked red appeared near it out of nowhere. It also flew in a circle and then went past the second still one.  It was slow moving but as it passed the still light, the white lights of the still light group got brighter and the red light got brighter on the traveling one- as if they were signaling one another.  We later noticed 2 others holding still in just the same way as the first 2 and the four of them were clearly holding a square formation as the others flew around.  Several more traveling red light formations appeared and did the same circular motions before going straight.  Most moved very slowly but some went unusually fast.   After about 15 minutes, all of the moving lights had disappeared as quickly as they had appeared, but the four still diamond ones held their formation.

I saw two lights traveling in a line, there were diferent in size: one was white and big, and next to it, a green one, smaller, one of them was flashing.  We are not sure which one. It is an ovni? I asked him.  He did not answer.  I was afraid because I remembered that our planes lights are usually red.  As we were staring, the lights went up in a line very fast disapearing on the clouds.  Our planes cannot do that kind of movement.",2019-05-14T00:00:00,,

I inch even closer to the window. These two lights blink back a forth together for about a min rapidly increasing their blinking speed.

The state park is located approximately 5 miles south of South Haven Michigan and adjacent to Palisades Nuclear power plant.  We checked in for a week long stay on Wednesday June 30th, 2021. On the evening of July 1st, 2021 my son and I returned to the campground from fishing in South Haven at approximately 10:30pm. At that time my wife, both children and myself decided to walk down to the beach despite the fact the beach and park lot leading to the beach having closed at 10pm. We proceeded to the beach at approximately 11:00pm.  From our camp site across the parking lot to the beach is approximately .5 miles.  Once we reached the beach I immediately noticed that in the distance on the horizon you can see the lights of Chicago. In the faintly illuminated sky of Chicago I notice a bright light just off the surface of the water.  Despite the perceived distance, the light was bright. Initially, despite the rough lake state, I thought it was an anchor light of a boat. From where we stood on the beach if looking directly across the lake was 12 o’clock the light would be at 10 o’clock. In miles Lake Michigan is approximately 70 miles in distance across the lake.  As I was explaining to my children that you can see the lights of Chicago in the distance a second light appeared directly above the first light that, to this point, was stationary. I said “look there is a second light”  At this point my two kids were getting scared and were panicking. We all had flash lights and I asked them to shut them off so I could try and see what the lights were. At this point the second light that appeared disappeared and the light that was stationary began to move from left to right. At this point it began to pick up speed to the point I said out loud the my wife and kids “look how fast it is moving”. It moved from the 10 o’clock orientation to 12 o’clock or straight in front of us in a matter of seconds. It maintained a perceived orientation of just off the surface of the water.  Once it was at the 12 o’clock position it stopped and the second light reappeared and disappeared. The light that was on the surface of the water went directly up then started closing the distance between where it was and where we were standing.  Once the light was what I perceived to be half way to us I told everyone to run back to the campground and not to stop.  From the time we saw the second light for the first time and the time we began to run to the campground was only probably 10-15 seconds.  Once we saw the second light we tried to film the lights but with the hectic nature of the experience and the dark conditions we only managed to capture just the light for a brief second.

They would get to the same area in the sky and the fire looking flickering would stop. Some of the objects seemed to fly back east across the sky when the flickering stopped. This went on for about 13 minutes or so. After I seen that I joked saying if they found some shoes and a pizza box let someone now what we seen. Then I started back walking with my pizza. The sky seemed darker after seeing the objects in the sky. I walked for like 5 minutes. Started seeing a red and white light flashing light in the middle of the sky which seemed like it just stayed stationary in the center of the sky. For some reason I was scared to look at it to long doing so made me feel uneasy. I would just look at the sky from time just to see if it was still there and it was but I would not look at it to long it made me feel uneasy. That’s what I seen will also try to send the video from my iphone as well.,2021-08-16T00:00:00,39.73540852059925,-84.16762780898877

We were chatting and looking at the stars as it was a relatively clear night with a few sparce small clouds. I happened to notice a fast moving object above the horizon to the east near Milwaukee. I have watched meteor showers, saw lots of planes in the sky and also the international space station and this did not look like any of them. It had a red light that would go from bright to dim but did not blink or strobe.   Red lights are on airplanes and helicopters so this is what I thought it was at first. My first thought was that it was moving very fast.  It was moving so fast we had to turn our heads from south east to north east to keep it in sight. Shortly after two more identical objects came rushing across the sky at incredible speed and slowed down at the last second to make a triangle formation with the first object.  They would move in all directions, up and down, left and right for several minutes rather slowly.  One of the objects would stray away slightly to break the perfect triangle formation but then quickly return. When we continued to watch and look closely we could make out it was orange red lights swirling around a yellow center object.  They seemed to reflect the light of the moon or glow at different times (one object at a time) and would out glow the other two for a second.  They looked like an atom with electrons around them. They moved all the way from east to north, then back to our east.  The speed would go from perfectly stationary to zipping across the entire skyline in seconds, faster than a shooting star or meteor.  Eventually they moved out of sight to the south, as they lowered down below the horizon which was a treeline miles away.

I am 58 years old and now live in the U.S.  As a child I had an encounter with something almost 50 years ago in Canada.  This encounter has had me intrigued with UFOs ever since. As a child I grew up in Chateauguay Quebec and back then it was a small town outside of Montreal.  My grandparents lived several blocks from my parents home and I would go and see my grandparents every Saturday morning for a glass of Coke.  I’m not sure of the year but I will say between 1970 or 1971. It was on that morning that I was riding my bike to my grandparents home.  What I thought was unusual was I seemed to be the only one outside at that time so I’m guessing it was early in the morning.  No one out on the streets or working on their lawns as I could best remember.  The sun was up, so maybe 7am. As I got to the end of my street, I cut across a lot or piece of property no bigger than an acre.  When I got to the sidewalk I heard a strange sound, more like an unusual sound.  It was noticeable enough that I shook my head side to side like when you have water in your ears or an infection.  To me the only way I can explain it was...it sounded like the hum from an old refrigerator. That sound to this day, although with time, does not bother me as it did when I was younger but nevertheless when I hear a similar sound it takes me back to that day or should I say that morning. After pedaling a hundred yards or so I stopped my bike and I had an impression to look up and when I did, I saw a ship floating above my head.  I’m guessing on the height from me to the ship, but across the street were 3 story buildings and this ship was a little higher than that, only directly over me.  I’m only 8 or 9 at the time but I told myself, “why is it not falling”. I did not hear a sound except for the hum.  Not at any time was I afraid.  As a matter of fact I was excited, or perhaps in shock. What I saw defies all description.  It was wedged in shape and all 3 corners were rounded. When I say wedged I mean it was longer to the front, a smooth surface.  I could see the outer rim of the ship was rounded, not sharp edges you would see on a flap on the wing of a plane.  The belly of the ship was flat, and I didn’t see landing gear or lines to see where the wheels would come out during landing.  I’m guessing that this ship was the size of a jet fighter.  It was silver and what I remember most about the ship was at each point of the wedge were half dorm lights on the bottom that shown bright.  A brilliant white light to be exact.  The back end almost looked serrated, like a saw blade.  As an adult now I can say there were no commercial or military markings.  I watched in amazement as it went higher and higher but ever so slow, like it floated on air.  I only saw the under belly so I can’t describe it anymore than what I saw.  How long was I there watching?  I’m not sure. Years later at my father's funeral in Calgary in 2016, I met my younger brother whom I hadn't seen in 30 years and I asked him if he remembered the UFO to which he said. “You wouldn’t stop talking about it that summer”  I wanted confirmation.  I knew I hadn’t seen things but just his remarks reassured me I wasn’t crazy.  He continued. “You came and got Jeff and I and took us back to where you saw this thing. You were excited and made us look for UFOs all that day.”  The story got even stranger years after.  My older brother takes me out to lunch and after hearing some heart wrenching life stories of his own he tells me of the time our late aunt Burnie saw what she described to him as a wedged shaped UFO going down the center of our street in Chateauguay on a blizzardy night roughly the same time period, first part of the seventies, only her encounter happened in the winter.  She saw the blinking lights through the window of our home on Mercier Street in Chateauguay Quebec, thinking it was an emergency vehicle only to be gripped with fear to see a ship moving down the street, floating 10 or so feet above the ground and traveling at a slow rate of speed before it disappeared into the snow wall.  The ship seemed to be what I saw but I did not notice any other colour of lights but white.  I never told my older brother about this event until that day.  I was ! floored to hear that someone else saw what I did but regrettably she passed away in 1996 and I never had the chance to speak with her about the event.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,45.36097241379311,-73.72629482758622

On the evening of October 7th 2020, a clear night, I began my observing run as an amateur astronomer. After my automated scope was set up and running, I decided to do some DSLR imaging of the Milky Way. I was using my Nikon 3200 camera with a William Optics Precision Refractor scope on a tracking mount. I was using Mars as a bright focusing point. During the focus procedure, while examining the image for focus and sharpness, I noticed an object that appeared to be out of focus in comparison to the rest of the image, which was odd. I removed the SD card to examine the image on my laptop. When I zoomed in on this oddity in the image, I can only say I was jaw dropped. There was a disk shaped object that just could not be in the image according to all logic. As an avid amateur astronomer for the past 30 years, I have taken tens of thousands of images and have never seen anything like this, and could not explain what I was looking at. My initial thought was that ! this was a lensing aberration, yet with the sophistication of the equipment and the amount of time that I have used this setup, that conclusion just doesn't seem to add up. Furthermore, it was a 9 second exposure image, meaning that the object had to be stationary in those 9 seconds, or it would be a blurry streak. If I had simply bumped the camera to create the warped shape, then everything else in the image would also be warped. But every other object in the frame is perfectly round. Any object of rational origin in or out of the atmosphere would not be still enough to create such a sharp image. The appearance of the object in the image implies that if it is not within close proximity, then it must be an extremely large object. Keep in mind, all of this was rattling through my brain within seconds of seeing the image. I immediately ran back to the scope, which again is on a precision tracking mount, so the position would not have changed. I shot additional images, only to! find that the object was no longer there. I grabbed my 100mm ! astro-bi noculars, visually scanned the area, and was unable to locate anything unusual or moving in the area. The object was simply gone. I went back to my laptop to re-examine for any other explanations, and I showed the image to my daughter. She is 16 years old, in an advanced high school program, and dedicates most of her time to her education. In short, she has a scientific mind, and was utterly blown away by this image as well. She has also been searching for an explanation, and is beyond stumped. I cannot dispute the logic pointing to the conclusion that this image defies all rationality. I am open to anything that would explain what I captured that night, but as of right now, I have no reason to believe that this is anything other than a physical object as captured in the image. As to what that object actually is, I will leave that up to others to decide for themselves.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,39.16412530864198,-121.02348333333333

Instead, I am reporting it because it occurred at 9:15 PM on the evening of July 16, 2020, and is VERY similar to the witness report made only 2 days later from Lakeview, Ohio, which I noticed on your homepage just this evening (October 19, 2020). I use your site as a resource for finding commonalities between my own experiences and what others may be seeing in roughly the same time frame, so I felt that it may be beneficial to someone if I reported this, seeing as how there was already one report made that was so similar – if there was a trend of sightings that week which occurred elsewhere, it may help to determine the path this anomaly was following during that time period (assuming that it is in fact the same object in the report from Ohio). The circumstances of the sighting were simple – I was conducting one of my regular, routine “sky watch” sessions and noticed this coming over, moving roughly south-to-north at approximately 9:15 PM. There was no sound associated with the object, and it moved steadily and slowly, without blinking.  Unbeknownst to me, at some point prior to that,  I had accidentally bumped the focus ring on the front of my camera (a Sionyx Aurora), and in the video you’ll hear me fussing because I can’t figure out why the camera wouldn’t come into sharp focus . It wasn’t until later that evening I figured out the problem, so unfortunately, the clip is slightly blurry.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,37.601,-78.6127

I would not have called it a sighting because it was so startling.  It was only after I related what I saw to my husband that I realized it was without doubt a UFO.  My husband was extremely tired that evening and had gone to bed before me.  So when I saw the sight, I didn’t wake him (and I’m kicking myself for not doing that) because he was so tired.  I saw up on a hill near the back of our home a flaming dome.  When I say flaming I mean this literally.  It appeared to be burning.  I could see the fires within it churning and burning.  It was vidid.  It had an aura.  Oddly the aura appeared to be something artificial because it did not appear ethereal.  It looked somehow like a designed aura.  It was sort of like scallops with a black edge.  But it was light.  I was dumbfounded.  I had an preconceived idea of what UFOs look like.  This fit nothing I’d ever heard of.  I decided to get a flashlight and go outside to see if lI could see it better.  But it was early in the morning and we have wild animals out here and I decided it would not be wise to do this.  By the time I got the flashlight and returned to the window, it had diminished.  I would say I was away maybe 6 minutes.  Then as I stood and watched, the dome simply gradually  diminished in brightness and somewhat rapidly vanished (as if disappearing into the hill).  It just collapsed  right before my eyes.  And it was just gone.  When I told my husband about it the next morning, he said it was probably a UFO.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,45.2874,-110.8689

The ones that can light up clouds. So here i am in my back yard at night about anywheres from 11 at night to 3 in the morning shining my light up there.night after night i did this.then it happened.and i have a witness.i saw them.they came in from the east north from a spot in the sky.first two appeared came down over my trees but back a bit .looked like about 3 blocks away.then 3 more came to line up with the other two.then two more.these two i waited for to see just where it was in the sky and if there was a hole . anything. And two more appeared 7 in all.a perfect side by side. Not one was higher or farther apart from each other. Not a sound and they came in very smooth like sort of gentle.at this time im frozen in place kinda worried wondering if more willshow up. Then as i looked at them there crafts glowed to dark or! ange to a lighter orange.i saw what looked like a table with someone behind it.then after about 7 minutes msybe 5.they judt left. The first one went west north then they all followed suit. Perfect in ever move.no sound nothin.now comes my contact if you can call it that.my cat about two weeks ago was dying hes loseing hair. So i was thinking on putting him down. Trouble is i cant.i love him.so i got mad and angry cursed the gods and all aliens even the annunaki.big mistake.all my life i new we were not alone but some of it like gods and angles i took as myth.not anymore. I was lying down with my cat half asleep but still alert and awake.i never head him or her but i opened my eyes and was looking into the most beautiful thing i ever saw.it was an eye. I saw the eye and the corner socket .the eye was just amaxing and big because thats all i saw. Then it was gone.well im a sane man no medical crap in my family. And no meds. Im not a drunk. Or dope addict.what i see i trust my! self. This hit me so fast and so hard i couldnt stay in my hou! se.so i wrnt for a walk thinking. But it was all just to real.i said no way was that a comic ir cartoon or myimagination i couldnt do that .. Then i said maybe somewhere in my mind i could have seen it at some point in life butnope. Not this this was to real and in my house.anyway as i was walking i saw the church . i live in a small town.i went over got on my knees never looked around judt got on my knees and prayed to god. Now what coulf make a man do this. Plus im still mad they never healed my cat. They were hear why didnt they fix him. Anyways all this stuff about space time travel or worm hole travel is very real. Thats why you dont see them in space alot. They travel by worm hole or something.the annunaki are real the grays are real. And they do call themselves gods.so its all true.they took away my imagination my thoughts on life itself. Ive changed .i dont watch tv shows like are we alone or have we been visited. That makes me so angry.and you guys no about this stuff.so yo! u also know im not lying  .because if you saw this eye your first thought would be wow.so ive learned that they will nothelp us in any way..but they do hear every word we say.we are being watched and you can piss them off. I did. And im a no body.so now i have to find away to dye without them knowing.i think they harvest our souls to maybe live longer in some way.but if they can appear in your home i thought only god can do this.but they can too.so now im scared for my soul.been doing research on this lately.aboutthe annunaki.and so far im right and itdont look good for us.ok thats my claim.im the firsthuman that accually had one in my home.and he or she came here because i got angery with them.i live in melfort saskatchewan.and the one who came here either let me see her or she or he made a mistake.either case ithappened 5 days ago.its now october 23 2020.thanks.,,,

The movie screen was near the Tibbs Avenue border TIME AND SKY CONDITIONS.  The sun had set with the sky still blue and cloudless.    Wind, calm.  It was still too light to start showing the movie. OBSERVATION:  I was working outside at the theater when I saw a silent white cloud (see illustration) a few degrees above the southern horizon and moving rapidly to the northwest.  I lost sight of it as it went behind the movie screen, but it appeared again at the north edge of the screen.  it appeared to reduce its travel to the north and was going away from me into the western sky.   Its shape was a diminishing dot with the color becoming redder with increasing distance.  It moved horizontally without any climbing or descending maneuvers.  I estimate the object moved through about 90 degrees of azimuth in less than 8 seconds.  I estimate the length of the object appeared to match about half an inch at arm's length. A number of theater patrons saw it.  The following morning, the Indianapolis Star newspaper had a 3 or 4 inch article about the police department receiving many phone calls from people who saw it.  The article also reported that the flight crew of a commercial flight approaching Indianapolis had seen this event.",,39.80764884833982,-86.14221402931499

I have spent many hours, through out the past two years, reliving this event, to pin point the most accurate date and time.  It was twilight and it was summer.  It was a perfect time, to go outside, sit on the step of my one room cabin, and gaze at the stars. I sat comfortable on that warm, sun baked cement step, and looked straight over to the lake and up to the top, of a mountain.  The sky was clear and I could still see perfectly, because it was a perfect twilight setting. All at once I noticed a black cloud, the only cloud around. It was just like, pop there it was, mean while the rest of the sky was still perfectly clear.  I sat and payed close attention to it. The black cloud kept coming and coming and coming it seemed to take forever.  When it cleared the mountain and the front of it was above me that’s when I realized this is not a cloud, this is a UFO.  At first, I was brave and repeated to myself land, land, land.  But when this thing got closer and I really got a good look at the perfect pure black cigar shape well the impact of the event got the better of me.  I grounded myself by repeating to myself, don’t land, don’t land, don’t land.  I’m up on my feet now I haven’t taken my eyes off it.  As it is, about to go over me, I can see clearly what appears to be, two exact attachments on each side that angle straight outward for many feet and then straight downwards for many feet.  The craft was silent and so was everything else around me. It was at least 45 seconds before the craft cleared me and the cabin. I ran to the back side of cabin and watched it just pass over the trees and realized it was a lot lower. I watched as it slowly cleared more trees and then it was pop, gone. I then walked into cabin as if nothing had just happened and went to bed. Out like a light.  I had no way to know what time it was. No clock no watch no electricity.    new info. The mountain is 2300 feet in elevation. Cabin sits one mile from foot of MTN. Appx. length of craft one mile.

I did not see a UFO,  but in 1970, when I was about 5 years old, I was awakened and called from my bed.  My mother, new-born sister, and younger brother were all asleep.  My great-grandmother was sleeping in her room down the short hall.  In complete darkness, I crawled out at the foot of the bed as to not wake my brother, who slept with me, then I went through the dinning room and into the kitchen and to the back door.  I was in nothing but my underwear. I unlocked the latched of the backdoor and stepped out onto the concrete steps that led down to the grassy yard. Half way down, I took a seat.  Then, In the middle of the yard a large head suddenly hovered over the ground. I glowed in a green light.  It's face was human-like but thin and bony looking, without Facal fat, and it had a small thin mouth. It's eyes were black without eyeballs and it had no hair. But what made it not human was it's giant egg-shaped head. It looked like a human face was stuck at the bottom of an egg.  Even with no eyeballs I knew the head was looking at me. I was not scared. In fact I felt nothing and thought nothing. I knew it was not a real head, but a projected image, a holograph of some kind- although I didn't know anything of the sort existed at that age. Then the head spoke to me without words or moving its mouth. It said to telepathically that THEY had follow and guided my bloodline since the defining of time, and that even my mother and father, who were not married, had been brought together brought together for bloodline purposes.  I could completely understand everything the head said to my mind. Then it put an image in my mind of a river and a group of naked black people on the other side eating some kind of fruit. It said I was a dependent from this group of early people and THEY had been with them ever since.  The head also said that was a war going on in an unseen place but also that some human serve both sides- the righteous side and the evil side. It also said that the Great War will come upon the earth too, and that I was to play some part in it. It also said that when I am a man I would meet others like me, who's bloodline THEY had watched and nurtured.  The head said that as I got older I would come to great understandings, of which I was not ready for then, but would slowly reveal the truth of reality to me. I was told that a gradian had been assigned to watch and protect me from harm and to make sure I did use my gift in the wrong way (And from then until I was about 24 years old, I felt the presence of my protectors with me).  I have much more to express; like reverse engineering my mind when I was still a young child, and when Iunderstood the structure of my own consciences, and my practice of mind reading I developed. Please note that did not speak much at all until I was 12 or 13 years old because I KNEW no body could understand me while I understood every thought others had. I would love to tell someone how I ascended and filled out the entire universe on two occasions, and how I am able to see the patters of the overlapping dimensions that make up physical reality.  I do not remember going back through the house to my bed but I do remember laying in the darkness before going back to sleep, thoughtless and without fear.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,32.326774803149604,-90.19263976377952

They came through our home with a whistling wind which boomed our ears and then those extra bright spherical lights as it was one leading all the others , i recall .The bleeping noise was so loud that wake up all of us including ,at the time ,my youngest sister crying as the all women were frightened but myself as i heve felt ,somehow, that there was no danger but trying communication with this repetitive bleeping which accelerate or diminished depending their/our movement in the apartment . I tried to chase those lights which changed shaped ,though remaining spherical as something was inside their outer coat . Loud and free floating as they were trying to impose their presence ; i was fascinated , wanted to know more but my ex gf after the second night of the appearance at the time of entering with the usual wind , she angrily shouted to them to go away and closed the window , and they never came back . i was angry at her because i am certain if she didnt react that way , they would have kept coming to see us ; the second night whilst i was asleep she told me, the morning after that they came against us in the bed and as she tried , frighten, to wake me up i reassured her that nothing bad was happening and told her to go back to sleep as nothing was happening. I didn't want to wake up and i didn't indeed. The apartment on the second floor was situated in front off the walls of a parachuting military Italian army ,and in Leghorn there is an important US base called Camp Derby although is about 15 km away ; we  have  tough of some king of military experiment , but i had the feeling of seeing entities more that a lifeless lights and sounds . Beep beep grave and more acute less grave when accelerating sound like they wanted to make sure we could see them ,like playing as i was moving and chasing them like cat and mouse staff. In that region of Italy i have hear a fisherman fishing and seeing a bright light coming out from the sea botton and going up to the sky ,and knowing that person i know he wasn't drunk or trying to play jokes of this kind . i have read about orbs , but with bleeping sound and for 3 consecutive days?? I lived till now wanting to know what that magical experience was , and franckly an experiment of the military it doesn't sound the answer as i have perceived a form of life and they were in front of us , at about 1_2 metres away and sized about a ping pong balls , but moving within their shape as they could split (and maybe they did as i recall all of this as a vivid dream , so vivid i have invented in my brain ,BUT we were 5 OF US!! Then we even went out and check the sky , at night with a friend of mine and his gf and he said that we saw white lights going up n down horizontally....but this i cannot be sure 100% I hope my writing is clear enough and i wish to share or to know more about this experience and if we were abducted ?

No Lights, No Sound. Son's Report of Father's Sighting This is a true story of what my father saw in Las Vegas 31 years ago. It lasted all of between 7-10 seconds, but forever changed his and my families belief in UFOs and potentially extraterrestial spacecraft.  In late summer/early fall of 1989, my father (a musician and sign artist) and his best friend (also a musician and local inventor) were coming out of my father's home just after having finished a jam together. It was dusk, and the sky above was colored a deep orange/red while the sun continued to set. At that time, my father lived in a house on the east side of Las Vegas on a street named Betty Ln. As he stepped out onto his porch while carrying his friend's guitar amplifier, he suddenly had the urge to look up.  Looking out west toward Red Rock Canyon, he observed what started out as a tiny black dot ""arc"" over the mountain range. The dot was rapidly growing in size as it crossed over the Vegas valley within seconds toward my father's end of town, and it was quickly apparent it was a ship of some kind. The ship was ""tumbling"" and ""skipping"" in the air as it came closer. My father excitedly grabbed his friend's shoulder, pointed up at the object while exclaiming his friend's name.  By the time his friend had looked up, the object was now approaching overhead above my father's house and they could now make out the shape and color of the ship. The closest way to describe it's shape was that of a ""Tootsie Pop"" (I also have his sketches of the object on hand for anyone who would like to see). It was a large sphere, estimated to be somewhere between 25-50ft. in diameter with a thick band that encircled its center. It's color and texture has always been hard for my father to describe. Everything about it looked ""alien"". The ""metal"" looked prehistoric, and the texture was almost like metal mixed with concrete. Somewhat similar to pewter in appearance, with a bronze/gray color. There were no lights, no windows, no hatches or anything on the craft.  As it came overhead, the ship rapidly and seemingly at random changed pitch and pivoted back and forth as it tumbled through the air. There was absolutely no sound or noise coming from the object whatsoever. At its closest point, the object was at a low altitude of approximately 300ft. above my father's house. When he and his friend were directly below, they observed that the object appeared to be distorting the air around it, making the ""metal"" of the ship appear to be moving or melting. They felt frightened and the feeling was beyond ominous.  After it passed his home, it suddenly shot rapidly upward over Sunrise Mountain into the sky, out of our atmosphere into space. The whole front end of it lit up and left behind a white phosphorescent trail as it departed, all still without making any sound.  All of this happened within a span of 7-10 seconds.  The two of them stood there, frightened and speechless until my father asked his friend ""What the f- is that?"" His friend replied "" I don't know, but it wasn't made in Detroit."" He also said he saw another ship out in the distance that my father didn't notice as he was fixated on just the one ship and that he thought that the ships were riding on electromagnetic waves. His friend has a quite pronounced stigmatism that may have been why he saw the other ship and my father did not.  They walked back into the house, and on television on channel KLAS-8 there were reports of 6 ships that were reported by multiple witnesses passing over Las Vegas.  They spent the rest of the evening discussing the event and the aftermath of what to do. Ultimately, they kept the story to themselves, as they felt no one would actually believe them and didn't know who they should report it to or what good what come of it.  My father had said he'd always wanted to see something like that, but once he did he wished he never had.  ""It was nothing but a giant question mark in my life. If we had come out of the house 5 seconds later we would have never seen it.""  It wasn't like the spectacular wonder of ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind."" In the end, it was a disturbing experience that has been etched in his and his friend's minds forever.  Incidentally, later that same year Bob Lazar came out about S-4 and the reverse engineering technologies that were happening there. We've always believed him, in that it is impossible that we could have created propulsion systems like the one my father observed.  And that's the story. Did anyone else see anything like this that year, or know someone that did? I am posting this report in the hopes it will be of value to the ongoing study of this phenomenon. And I'll always be keeping a look out.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

One evening in 1994, one of the mainstream news channels had said there was a chance to see ""shooting stars"" I believe it was (if memory serves me correctly it may have been an eclipse or something else, I'm not 100% sure of the exact event.)   This was very intriguing to my 9 year old self. I begged my Mom to let me stay up later than usual so I could watch the sky. She agreed. She called my Aunt who lived behind us, and invited her and my cousin to come along; they did. So the four of us watched the sky together that nite. What we experieced is something that has stayed with all of us until this day.     It was a clear night so we kept our eyes peeled as we waited; watching and talking amongst ourselves. I was allowed to stay awake for just a little longer. Although I didnt expect to see much, I remember being happy my Mother let me stay up for this. All the kids in school had talked about how their parents had agreed to let them watch the sky that nite, too.    We hadn't been out there on my porch very long. Less than an hour or so if I had to guess. I couldn't tell you if we did, or did not end up seeing the ""shooting stars"" or whatever it was that we were intending on seeing. What I can tell you, is that we unquestionably experienced a UFO sighting.     I remember where we were standing. I remember looking up at one point, and seeing a BRIGHT, low, and very large yellowish-colored light in the sky. It didn't move. It had NO sound. I do not know for sure the shape of what we saw, because the light was so intense that it took away from being able to distinguish the actual shape. It appeared to be shaped like a saucer, with intense light throughout. I remember thinking that I must be the only one who sees this light. I was expecting someone to exclaim ""what is that!"", but no one made a peep. It seemed like the longest and loneliest few seconds of my life as I stood there;  paralyzed throughout my body with intense fear. Unbeknownst to me, I later found out that the other 3 people said they were also too shocked to say a word, much like I was.    Then it was gone. Just as fast as it had appeared before us it disappeared. Then someone spoke, and we all looked at each other and began to freak out about it. Some of the things said were ""That was too low to be an airplane."" Or ""I've never seen something like that."" Etc.    Then it was back. It reappeared about a minute or so after it left. This time... it began to move. It moved like nothing is supposed to move in the sky. It was FAST. So fast, it left trails of light. It was off the the left, then the right. Then up, then down. It was very hard to process what I was seeing, because even at 9 years old I understood that there was no way that something that big, and that close could navigate back and forth and up and down like that without making an engine sound. Or any sound at all, for that matter.    While it was quickly dancing across the sky above us, it changed colors. They light went from pale yellow, to bright yellow. Shades of yellow and trails of light moved at light-speed. No slowing down to stop mid air. It stopped just as fast as it moved and repeated the process.    This sighting was the longest of the 3 sightings that nite. This went on for approximately 5 minutes. It had small intermissions of appearing to be gone, just to come back again.    We were terrified. I do not remember what was said-- if anything durring those 5 or so minutes. I do not remember why the hell we didn't turn around and run into the house to take shelter and hide. I especially do not remember who's idea it was for all of us to follow this craft into my backyard or why anyone would even think that was a good idea.    But we did. So sighting 3 (although hazy and confusing) went something like this: it's back, it's now in the sky behind us, and we should go out in the sandpits/wooded area to follow it.    ""Go get your jacket"" my Mom said. I ran into the house, grabbed my coat and ran back outside and we all took off walking behind my house and behind my Aunt's house. I will say.... in retrospect --- this seems very, very weird to me. I KNOW I was completely terrified. why would I agree to follow it? That part still boggles my mind till this day and the others I was with say the same. How stupid it was for us to do that, as scared as we all were. Especially 2 Moms thinking it was a good idea to take 2 kids to chase a alien ship.    I do not remember seeing it as we ventured into the backyard. I do not remember who chose the spot we ended up in, or why. But we stood there waiting. It was as if we knew we would see it again.    We did.   Sight 3 consisted of us looking up as if to say ""okay, we are here...start the show.""    It did.     This time it appeared higher than it appeared the first 2 times. And this time.....it came directly at us like it was going to crash into us/the ground and I was sure I was either going to die, or get abducted. The warp-speed yellow light went from miles away, and zoomed right TOWARDS us. I'll never understand how it was able to stop that close to us without slowing down.    I SCREAMED. My Mom, who was standing behind me covered my mouth. The two adults told us to keep quiet. (Very weird, I know.)  The light-craft again dissapeared and we headed home. My Aunts house was closer to where we were now. I dont remember saying our goodbyes, or even talking about what we saw. It could be because I was in shock, or perhaps my mind has only obtained the dramatic details, I'm not sure.    My Mom and I get home. I remember getting in my bed. We had just moved my room around, and of course my bed was now in front of the window. I thought for sure that I was going to get sucked out of my window and abducted. I just knew it. I laid there, blankets up to my face. Sweating, too afraid to move. While listening to my Mom tell my Dad the story of what just took place. I listened as my Mom recounted our experience to him as I picked up on the disbelief in my Dads voice, and it angered me. It angered me because I needed him to believe our story. What if my Mom and I knew too much? What if the aliens came back, and took us because we saw them and my Dad didnt know who took us,  because he wasn't believing our story. He would for sure not be able to save us from the aliens if he didn't know where to look, or send the police.    Those are the real thoughts I had that nite. Praying my Dad would believe us so he knew where to come look for us, because we surely were about to go missing. I was convinced our days and even moments left in the house were numbered. I also grappled with being angry at my Mom for letting me stay awake past my bedtime. ""Why would she let me stay up to watch the sky on a friggin school night""? and ""This is all her fault"" I thought to myself. My mind raced and I stayed paralyzed under my blankets, until I fell asleep.    I'm 36 years old now. My Dad still doesn't believe us. My Mom and I stopped telling people, for fear they would think we are nuts. We do talk about it here and there, my Aunt, cousin, Mom and myself knew what we saw. We know how ""crazy"" it sounds. We know we saw a lit up craft defy the laws of physics and gravity. We know it was a UFO.    What we dont know... is why we followed it as terrified as we were. That part we will NEVER understand. ",2020-12-23T00:00:00,41.9113,-71.13

My dad had rented a convertible and we went out after curfew. (everyone else was getting ready for bed and when we arrived back were all asleep). We were driving down the highway. We did not spot any other cars or any that we can remember. I would have been 8-10 years old at this point and my father would have been in his mid to late 30's. I could find out our exact age and general date of this sighting by looking at some pictures we took at the camp. (I do not have them handy as they are at my parents house.)  We noticed and object that looked spherical or circular in shape. It emitted a very bright light which made it impossible to see the exact shape. It was white/blue and the light seemed to shine off in every direction around it.(Similar to staring at a star). It was however very large. Similar to if you could pulled a star in very close to you.  It hovered perfectly still over the highway to the point we thought maybe it was just a light. When we about reached the point to be directly under the object it suddenly shot further out straight it front of us. The speed almost looked like teleportation but we could tell it moved and it had a light trail where it had moved. If not for the light trail we probably would have thought it teleported. It the proceeded to shoot far out to the left side of the sky, then to the right, all awhile keeping up that teleporting like speed. It shot back to the center of the highway and allowed us to almost come right underneath it again before rep! eating that sequence. It did this several times. I do not remember when this whole thing ended. I think it just shot off and was gone but my Father would have to confirm this with me. We still talk about it to this day but I can't recall either of us talking about how this ended. I honestly don't remember the end of this encounter but will try to find out if needed.  Thanks  P.S. the object did not make a sound. no humming or engine type sounds. When the object allowed us to come towards it on the highway it was almost directly over top of us several times.

My mother saw a crown-like disk shaped object (about the diameter of a beach ball, she says) that flew and stopped right in front o! f her and then vanished ridiculously fast into the sky as soon as she began to yell and pray. I tried to look up to find the boomerang shape craft after she released me but it was not there anymore. Till this day, my mother and I still remember that night and we talk about it from time to time. We both are certain that we saw something that night, I was between the ages of 7 and 9 years old.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829

Halfway through the survey I noticed a small shinny chrome colored globe about 18"" across floating  about 10' off the ground in the canyon. I at first figured it was a helium balloon. I kept working, but the globe wasn't blowing away in the breeze, and seemed always to be floating within site. I kept looking at it thinking I would see seams or some resemblance of a balloon or manufacturing, but the globe looked seamless. It stayed a distance of about 200' from me as I moved along the property finishing my survey of the lot. Before I packed up my gear I decided to go have a closer look because I was getting the creeps from this thing. The globe rised up about 3-400' off the ground when I walked towards it, then floated off to the West away from me until it was out of sight. I never got the close look I hoped for to ease my mind, but as I drove home I thought about it all day. A helium balloon can be round and chrome colored, but only from two angles (front and back). If the object was a balloon, it would have had seams and/or the fill spout off the bottom. The fact that it didn't appear to have a fill spout and always seemed perfectly round the whole sighting time just didn't allow me to accept it as a balloon. The fact that it flew off to the West towards Temecula also didn't make sense since the breeze was blowing in the opposite direction. I reported the event to my office workers when I returned back to my Nevada office but everyone just blew it off. This event has haunted me for 20 years, and I still can't explain the event no matter how much I think about it. I didn't see it until I started transmitting for RTK gps surveying, it didn't leave until my equipment was powered down. It was just too strange and unexplainable.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,33.528268601583115,-117.07936094986808

About 16 years ago, I was with my mom, my stepdad (at the time),  my  grandma, and my sister, at a family orientation weekend put together by SUNY Delhi. My brother was going to be starting his first year of college there.  Our whole family stayed in a motel for the weekend somewhere between Delhi NY, and Walton NY, along route 10. On our way to the motel, about 10-15 minute down route 10 we saw a very clear, and very close, self contained, basketball sized, orb of light. It floated across route 10 right in front of our car. It came out of the woods on the left side of the road, about 30-40 yards ahead of us. It floated approximately 5 ft above the ground the entire time, moving across the road in a horizontal movement, keeping it's height, and speed, consistent to about 5 mph, or a brisk walking pace. It was dark outside so it was fully illuminated by our headlights, and clearly visible.  Since we were driving towards it as it crossed the road, it arrived a! t the treeline on the right side of the road as we were parallel to it in passing. I was in the back seat and watched it float off into the woods about 40 more yards before we were too far to see it anymore through the thick foliage of the Catskill region. Everyone in the car saw it, and we are all still extremely mystified by it to this day. It's nice to have had others see it also, but it's hard to convince people who haven't seen it for themselves. I also admit that I am particularly skeptical of orbs seen in the sky, or caught on cameras, and in photographs, even after having seen one within 10-20 yards, with my own eyes.  This is in part due to there being far more potential for misidentification with something so far away, and mixed in with other bright lights like stars, and planes. But this was as clear as day, up close, with the naked eye, and with 4 witnesses. We could, and would all pass a lie detector test with flying colors if asked about what we saw on that am! azing night. And to be totally clear, there is absolutely no d! oubt beh ind what we all saw that night. No optical illusion, reflections, flashlights, or pranksters. I still have hope that there will be some resolution to this mystery, even though it has been 16 years. I regret not coming forward about that amazing experience sooner! I hope to be in touch with others who are interested, or have had up close encounters like this one.  Thank you for reading! Please feel free to share.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,,

Shortly after one of my friends walked inside his house one of us pointed out a strange sequence of lights that seemed to hover in place roughly 300-400 feet up and 600-700 feet south of where we were standing, slightly west of the gate 2 entrance of Fort Gordon Army base. We observed approximately 9 circular lights evenly spaced a few feet apart on a horizontal plane, blinking in random sequence, each emitting multiple colors of red, white, yellow and green light. The lights lit up in no particular order or color, sometimes one at a time, sometimes all at once, from right to left, left to right, and in pairs from the outermost toward the middle.

The lights did not drift, tilt, rotate or move from their position in the sky until the very end wh! en they abruptly moved further southwest in a straight trajectory slightly up and to the right, distal to our position, at an unnatural rate of speed. The object seemed to move without inertia, instantly achieving a very high rate of speed as it moved away toward a higher altitude, never passing over the horizon, and covering a great distance in just a few seconds until we could no longer see it.

I was laying in bed watching TV in my room late on Christmas night (but technically the 26th since it was past midnight) and through my closed window blinds I noticed a light shining through that I knew wasn't normally there because my bed faced the window directly. For whatever reason I was compelled to get up to see what it was and when I opened my shades I saw what I can only describe as a very bright ball of white light hovering completely still above a church steeple that peaked out above a line of trees in the distance less than a quarter mile or so away. At first I thought it was a helicopter with a spotlight on, but there were no blinking side lights that you usually see on planes, and it was eerily silent and still. It was almost like a glowing white star it was so bright. After a few seconds (I think?) or so, as I was trying to figure out what I was looking at, the light suddenly disappeared to black in a way that looked like the light got sucked i! nward towards the center until it was extinguished. I started to think ""hmmmmmm"" when no more than one second after it went dark did the ball of light reappear, now directly above my bedroom window! My heart started racing and I don't know when I shut my TV off but now I'm in the complete dark staring at this thing that's right outside my window and I'm horrified. It almost felt like ""it""(the ball of light) noticed me staring at it and came in for a closer look at me. Now I can see the underside of the ball and it has all kinds of colors going on as it just hovers there completely motionless. I wanted to run because I was afraid of it but my body was paralyzed in fear, and tears were coming out of my eyes but I wasn't making a single sound. I don't really know how long I was frozen there staring at it, my guess is probably under a minute, but suddenly the ball just shot straight up into the sky at a million miles an hour. The whole time I was unable to l! ook away from it, so much that I remember my face and hands sq! uished a gainst my window really hard as I was fixated on watching it fade into a tiny twinkle in the night sky then gone. Finally free from the paralysis, I woke up my mom to tell her what I had just seen and she thought I dreamed it... I didn't.

I was laid back in the driver seat, and noticed something in my peripheral vision. I turned my head to look and didnt see anything. I continue talking and a few minutes later I notice something again, I look and dont see anything, I'm thinking maybe it's a meteorite. A few minutes later it happens again, I look and see a point of light flying around. I got out of  my car to see it better. I'm standing on the sidewalk in front of my house under a streetlight looking up, I thought it could have been a bat but I saw no wings flapping and bats dont give off light in the dark, so I knew it was up higher. So now its above my house up high in the air zipping back and forth across the sky like a house fly and moving really fast.

Our video ca! mera battery was dead of course. I went back outside and it there was 2 points of light zipping around with each other, all over the sky. And then a 3rd point of light appeared and began doing the same thing. This goes on for several minutes more and all of a sudden they got into a horizontal line and paused, then shot straight up into the sky very fast and the two points of light on the ends flew off to the left and right, the light in the middle just kept going up until I couldnt see it anymore. They all returned and flew around more and then they started to have a trail of like glitter or sparkles behind them while they flew around. This lasted a few seconds and they continued zipping around. Then one by one they started to fly off to the east and they were gone, I waited a few minutes to see if they would return and they didn't and that was it. They had to be 10's of thousands of feet in the atmosphere. There was no noise or anything coming from the lights and the light! s weren't extremely bright but were white in color.

Invisible with Blue flame.

Beyond Comprehension. The object was first observed in the middle of our 3-seaon porch in Andover MN 55304.  I just happened to walk out to the porch as it was a beautiful fall night out.  I was reading a magazine on the couch when out of the corner of my eye, I noted a small blue flame slightly below eye level and as I was looking toward the house.  The blue light (flame) then disappeared.  Now, I thought for sure I saw something quite unique (not just ‘seeing things’), so to be sure, I did a couple of things.   I called out to my wife who was in the house.  She did not initially answer as she was putting the kids to bed upstairs.    That meant that she nor the kids could have had an object that could have caused a deflection in a window or something.  Also, there are periodic cars that go by a few hundred yards behind our house (and can be seen sometimes through the trees).  I tried to see if I could find a deflection of light on the windows from any cars coming by and could no! t come close.  I of course have never seen anything like this in the years of being on the porch, but none-the-less, I just wanted to confirm this.   I also moved my head around in all forms, as I wear glasses, and possibly I was getting some oddball deflection off a rim or something.   In all events, I was unable to remotely get any colored light to occur (or any reflections for that matter).  And also as a Christian, I was thinking that maybe it was some type of sign.  There was no feeling at all that it was intended to be a spiritual sign (which I kind of was hoping for...and I was not exactly a believer in UFO's).  In any event, after the first 2-3 second blue light flame, I went back to reading the magazine, and had to mark it up to just a very odd (but believable) sign that was just mysterious.  But after about 4 minutes, there it went again.  About another two-three seconds of a blue flame occurred, this time maybe about 1-2 feet from the original flame I had seen.   Now, based on the distance traveled, and where I first saw the flame, I believe that I walked through the ‘UFO’.  That’s right, the UFO was invisible, and I walked right through it.  By now, I know that I saw something beyond belief, but had no idea what it was.   And At this time, I was a little scared as I have no idea its intent.  I was thinking it could attack so I tried to play it cool and not stare at the empty space where I thought it occupied.   I would still glance, however.  After another 4 minutes, boom, there the light hit again.   This time it had moved about 3-4 feet so it was picking up speed, albeit very slowly.   But, this time, the light was on the other side of our three-season porch window.  It could fly through the window!  Not only that, but I would say that there was no slow down! for flying through a window.  This ‘UFO’ is now showing anti-gravity, invisibility, energy production, and matter transparency (i.e. fly through matter), all while demonstrating physical control.  And, when assuming it was sent as a probe to investigate our world, then it also means that it can maintain a memory of its travels while being all the things above.  Beyond belief.  After the third blue flame, I began to think it was not weaponized, and may not want to hurt me.  So, I did stand up and walked to the 3-season porch door toward the deck and continued to look for it.   I saw it again about mid-way on the deck, a little higher than eye level if sitting in a chair.  After another 4 minutes or so it started to pick up a little more elevation and was off the edge of the deck, about another 8 feet away.  I was now out on the deck following this thing.  One more light was seen about 12 feet off the deck, higher yet and near the pine trees.  After that, I figured I should be able to see one more blue light about 15-18 feet up from there and close to the pine trees (Based on the parabolic trajectory, I did not think it would have been in the tree).  Unfortunately, I was unable to see this last expected flame.  That evening, I watched the 10:00 evening news weather report (it was a cloudy night) and I was looking for a blip in the radar that might be a mother ship.  Yeah, right.  There was nothing seen on radar as one would expect. And, I also told my wife about what I had seen (that I saw a UFO) so that I would know I was not dreaming this.  A few weeks after, I asked her if I told her about the UFO, and she confirmed that I did in fact tell her about it (Confirming to me I wasn’t dreaming).  The ‘UFO’ itself was estimated as roughly the size of a single peanut (based on the flame size).  I was only 4-5 feet away from it initially.  Beyond reason, comprehension, and understanding, the ‘UFO’ that was observed in October was one of futuristic wonder.  Based on my estimates, it would take humans 600 years to understand and develop anything remotely close to this UFO, as we would need to harness and control light (I presume it was created with and internally controlled by self-controlling electromagnetic waves within its own ‘orbital’).  Something not even comprehended with current knowledge.  Probably 6 Eureka moments of Newton and Einstein will need to occur with significant ongoing development between each to achieve such a wonder.  Maybe it will take multiple waves of Artificial Intelligence to advance to such a level and reduce the time of comprehension.  But for today, beyond understanding.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,45.2573,-93.2741

In broad daylight, afternoon 2-4pm, the sphere was overhead, moving SW to East at airplane speed, but low, a couple hundred yards overhead.  The sphere was many times larger than a passenger jet and had a large hole in it, of which I couldn't tell if something hit it, or if it exploded from within, although I could see halls and floors within the hole.  It went from being visible to being invisible, and was surrounded by a tube shaped (self emitted atmosphere?) I could see the atmosphere at times, and there was what looked like lightening within it, as if the ship were damaged,(maybe someone shot it,) so it appeared to be shorting out. I imagine that is why it would cloak, then be uncloaked.  I was on Point Dume, raking up lemons, and watched it move across the bay of LA at I would estimate at the elevation of 500 feet. It quickly, (faster than aircraft but nothing supersonic or anything,) got to between the southern tip of LA's bay and the island of Catalina, and doinked into the ocean.  Two days later it exploded and part of it blew up into the atmosphere, and dozens of people got it on phone cameras. It was on the cover of the LA Times and is covered in many ufo documentaries.  I have seen the explosion on TV, but I seem to be the only person to have seen it enter the water.  A couple weeks later, a neighbor and I saw a blue sphere enter the ocean south of Point Dume.

There were three sustained white lights in a very close and tight triangular formation.

Suddenly, all three objects began advancing westward (toward land) in perfect unison. This is when I alerted some of my friends to what I was seeing. The lights kept perfect formation and moved very slowly. The lights continued to move for a minute or two before stopping on a dime and maintaining the formation. The lights held there for another minute or so, and then they simply vanished. No movement or anything. The lights were there and then they weren’t.

The field is about 2.5 acres in size and full of old cherry trees (it was an orchard back in the day) and knee-high orchard grass. My wife and I were in the kitchen when the kids came running in terrified, claiming they’d seen some small red creature peeking out from behind a bush. We were both struck by how seriously scared they were. They all saw it and explained how they watched it for a minute or so as it kept looking at them. I went out later and, based on their description, estimated it was about 70 feet away from them. We gave them the 20 questions; was it a fox, dog, etc.? But they insisted it was a creature on two legs and bright red. Like fire engine red, not a hue of red that exists in nature. The color they described made me skeptical. My wife and I were still mildly creeped out, but we! sort of wrote it off as kids seeing things. The kids refused to go back out that day.  Later that evening after dark, around 9-10pm, my 16-year old son (who had no knowledge of what his siblings claimed they saw earlier) came into the house scared, claiming he had seen something bizarre. He and two friends were walking just a few blocks from our house and saw a craft in the air. He said initially his brain couldn’t compute what it was. It was too low and not moving fast enough. At first, he thought it was a plane or helicopter crashing, but realized it wasn’t when he saw that it was triangular shaped with lights on the corners and was moving too slow and steady. He said there was a slight buzzing sound to it and it was dull metallic in texture.  He said it eventually went behind some trees that were around houses. He and his friends ran to keep it in their line of sight, but once they got to where they should’ve seen it, it had disappeared. He said given the speed it was moving and the time it took them to get into a better position, it should have still been there. So it seemed to disappear and the improbableness of it frightened them. He came home pretty shook about it and he’s not one to exaggerate or make stuff up.  Either event on its own is weird, but both happening on the same day was just bizarre and jolted us a bit. I was more disturbed by my older son’s experience, knowing the kind of kid he is. This motivated me to read about UFOs and I found your website and read up on others’ experiences. My older brother had seen a triangle years before, so I didn’t think that was too far-fetched, but I must admit the red creature experience was hard to believe and still is. However, I was surprised to find a couple stories on your website that also mentioned little bright red creatures. If you’re going to make something up, it seems like an odd color choice. I wonder how many others report a similar experience.  By the way, the date is approximate.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,40.29412297979798,-111.7016845959596

Many town people of Calauan and people form other places looked into this mountain in early 90s until now, but still no one has reported found it. Even if they found it they wouldn’t tell anyone.  That white UFO looks like its looking for something at those mountains that night and its whole body is lighting up bright white so I’m sure that is not a drone.

As I was one the phone with him, all the lights seemed to turn to the south “left from their direction of travel”. The speed of the lights seem to be very consistent. What really threw us off was when the first light made the turn it seemed to slow. It seemed to slow to wait the last light to make the turn.

Time is the most valuable thing in the universe surpassing water and oxygen, gold, silver. You get the idea.  But it's hard for me to talk about, let alone write about something so intimate and personal that has damaaged my life to a degree in various ways yet at the same time has improved my life in ways that most would laugh about cause they are ignorant.  How do I know you are not going to laugh at me? How do I know I am not wasting my time? How do I go know you will not exploit me to a higher authority? How do I know you will not use me to make money?  I have talked to you and mufon and I am not impressed by either of you but especially mufon.

I have made contact. Telepathy is not what, well at least the telepathy I have experienced was not what you see in TV and movies. The mutual exchanged info between me and ""them"" was done via the heart. They came to me off of vibrations my heart immitted mostly and then my mind. They are phenomenal. What they displayed to me is so out there it is only worthy of a far fetched fictional novel for an individual with a deep imagination and open mind.  They have the ability to do about anything. Yes anything. They can manipulate nature, they can show you things that have happened or will happen as if you were viewing a crystal ball. They can display themselves in any shape or form probably from what I seen.  But with them comes other phenoms. Spiritual phenoms and technology phenoms. They all keep track of one another. I do not know which one has impressed me the most through this experience. Actually yes I do. The spiritual one. No alien sorcery or technology can match what I have witnessed spiritually .  It all began after a tough time in my life. It started spirituality, followed by the ETs, and then I realized man has advanced itself to a degree high enough to moniter these brilliant events when they occur.  I love my country an my children and would never take part in anything that would do do the opposite. I suppose I am a bit selfish because I wish I had an answer on what has and is happening. I suppose that's why I reached out to you so that maybe I can share a bit more and you can give me an opinion?

Many of you have read this story or heard it on My Alien Life Podcast....  Here is an added illustration..  This is from memory, but is 99.99% accurate.  I have been creating this and trying to get this perfect for a year. This is exactly what I saw. If it were a movie, you'd see the color of this object change; much like how a squid changes its color in the ocean.  It was pearl white, but would darken and lighten in shades of grey and white as if it were reflecting the shades of clouds.  There is little doubt the skin of the object was perfectly smooth and was reflective; however I believe it was changing color for a purpose, or a reaction to something.  It was changing its color mechanically or bio-mechanically. At one point I believe it was a mile or so away to my right and as I turned off the main highway to get closer, it moved away.  It didn't move away from me in measurable distance.  It was as if the sky was a sheet of latex and someone behind it was pinching it and pulling it away and upwards, forming a concave cone of space. This cone was very apparent, however you had to be paying attention and at the same angle I was witnessing.  I truly believe if you were looking at it a 1/2 mile to my right or left you couldn't see the Tic-Tac because it was inside the vortex of space and time. It receded into space away from me; stretching the cone until it was out of my site.  Then the cone faded into the blue sky..   Here is my original narrative of the event. March 29, 2019 I was traveling through northern Montana at about 2:30 PM west of Kalispell.  The sky was mostly clear with a few small white wisps of clouds.  The four lane highway curved slightly to the left and for a few seconds I was able to see the western sky without obstruction. I noticed an object I thought may have been a kite or drone.  The highway took a slight right curve and now the object was about 10 o’clock out my driver’s side window.  I looked out and was able to locate it easier because it was closer and I could easily tell it wasn’t a kite or drone, however at this time I though it I may be seeing a white trainer type airplane at an angle that showed me the tops or bottoms of the wings.  It was approximately one mile away. I have mentioned in my podcast Star Wars I had a single sighting of multiple crafts back in the early 80’s.  I described these craft as medication capsules and now many are calling those Tic-Tacs. I was trying to get a good visual and drive at the same time and it didn’t take long for me to determine this object was in the same place for 30 or so seconds.  It wasn’t moving and I absolutely knew at this time it was not a conventional aircraft and I was also estimating it could be approximately 40 feet long (tic-tac) and wasn’t more than 700 feet up and to my left. In front of me less than ½ mile was an exit and an overpass.  The overpass angled slightly to the south and when on that overpass I knew the object would be directly in my front windshield and I would be higher than the highway and I would have a perfect unobstructed view. I accelerated and right before I hit the ramp I glanced over and the object was still present and hadn’t changed.  I came to a stop before turning left and glanced over and the object hadn’t moved.  At this point I honestly did not want to charge in the direction of the object as I felt it may retreat or disappear.   I crossed over the highway and the object was there and I do believe it was slightly farther away, but I had an excellent view. It was certainly Tic-Tac shaped, or slightly proportionally longer.  At first I thought it could be two objects close together as it looked like there was a bifurcation.  At this time the object was no longer totally white, but had tone gradations from white to gray to silver.  The distal ends were definitely white and rounded and there were white patches on the surface.  The different shades this object was displaying made me think at first they were reflections of clouds from the east.  Briefly I had the notion this object had a mirror or silver finish.  At this time I could clearly see the patterns were changing and it reminded me of how the color changes on a giant squid.  This object was pulsating with grey, white and silver and it was not totally bifurcated.  It was one object and the left side was displaying the color patterns and shapes exactly as the right side.  It was a pattern or almost camouflage as both sides were matching each other’s pattern.  The change was ! gradual and flowed slowly, but it was very apparent. I got to watch this display for about 30 seconds and the object started to get smaller or slowly moved away strangely.  When I say strangely, it seemed that the portion of blue sky around it moved and changed.  There was a distortion in the clear blue sky.  I was switching back and forth with and without polarized sunglasses to figure this out this whole scene, but it was almost like the blue sky in a circle around the object moved backwards.  Like the sky was making a concave cone and the object was in the center and the cone was stretching the sky away from me.  The object was traveling backwards at no more than 50 miles per hour or that was my perception.  Again at the same time I perceived it moving away or getting smaller.  Very strange.. Then like all good UFO sightings it was gone.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,48.1986275,-114.38388

I am just saying it doesn’t look like a bird, plane or balloon etc.  Below is a bullet point list of how to view on Google Earth and other notes or observations I may have.  I hope you find it interesting.  •	If in Google Earth (GE), type in this address to fly you there.  It is not my address or anyone I know.  It is just what GE lists as a location when in street view. &#61607;	1615 E. Cielo Grande Ave &#61607;	Phoenix, AZ •	Or if in GE, these are their GPS coordinates to get you to the same area: &#61607;	33 degrees 41’42.56”  & 112 degrees 02’51.63” •	As you can see, the round ball in the picture with the silvery top and what looks like to be a darkened shadow below. •	I realize that in GE Street View, things can become distorted.  That is why I am not claiming it is a true UFO. •	When GE takes you to this location, click to Street View Icon and try to go down to the very end of the dead end street to get the right view.  Reason being, is when I tried going back to this spot later, for some reason GE did not show that view and I had to play around with it to get it back up. Hopefully, you will not have that issue. •	When in Street View, for some reason when you click to go back and forth down the street, it sometimes gives you a view that does not show the object.  I am not sure if it is a left over picture from a previous Street View series or what.  But what I do look for is the bird that is sitting on top of the street lamp post as the indicator. •	Deer Valley Airport, which is a smaller airport is to the West. •	In testing my idea by going back out the street to find a plane flying in, you can definitely tell that it is a plane coming in to land at the airport.  But what I am looking at seems like a round ball which to me is definitely not a plane.  Thanks, and hopefully you may have an answer for this.  Sincerely,  Phoenix Arizona Resident.  I will also send an email to the address you list below with the pictures of what I am speaking about.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

It all started in the spring of 2020. All together I have had 100s of sightings and have had multiple interactions. I've also have had plenty of witnesses; which includes a high ranking officer in the Air Force.  Some of the UFOs I've seen are fireballs; but mostly different colors of light.. round. The interactions I have are flashes of light back and forth.  If I flicker a lighter or flashlight most usually they respond. One sighting I've seen with my girlfriend was one of the craziest I've ever seen. We were sitting on the back porch looking for any sign of a UFO because the night before we were seeing them all over. All of a sudden over the mountain in front of our house; huge balls of light (couldn't see an actual craft because they were so bright) one by one you could see them coming right over top of us. My girlfriend had our kids and was so scared she wanted to go in the house. The were flying in a straight line (no it was Starlink.. I've seen those satellites.. twice) and as they passed the tree in the back yard where we were they disappeared one by one into thin air. There was about 30 of them round about. It's like they left the realm of Earth or something. Very strange thing.. I don't think I'll ever see anything like that again. Something that is strange to me is that every since I have been seeing these UFOs ; I've also have been seeing military planes, drones, and helicopters. As the military planes came in the sightings have dwendeld down. It's hit or miss when I go out to see them, but almost every night I see at least a flash in the sky or what I call cruisers that just cruise thru the night sky then eventually disappear or zip off. I am a true believer and have seen it with my own eyes. There is a lot more I could tell but I would need much more time. I'm just glad I get to share my story with other people that have seen them too. I think it's also great that there is a team of people interested in what the government is hiding from us.

While it was not fully dark yet, I could see a lot of stars beginning to shine. I noticed a few stars rapidly blinking, and then realized it was a very large cluster of very fast blinking “stars”. They were in a horizontal swath. I called my friend’s attention to it, and he also saw it. Over the course of about 3-4 minutes, (though it may have been less), this cluster collectively moved slowly across the sky to the north. It stayed at roughly the same altitude and I could not determine how far away it was. I did see the entire cluster move behind the two-story roof of the neighbor behind me. I tried to determine if there was a pattern to the blinking, but it ! was too fast for me to make a determination of any kind of pattern. Some of the lights were brighter and bigger than the others but the blinking tempo was the same. The cluster maintained the same speed all the way across the sky until it was out of sight.

I live in a quiet suburb of Dublin, Ireland, in a house with a south facing garden. I am sceptical by nature, always seeking scientific explanations for anything unusual or unexplainable  At approx 130am, while taking in the cat from our garden, I noticed the night sky was fantastically clear. The suburb I live in has dark skies (for a city) but that evening was crystal clear with thousands more stars visible than normal. After a minute or so looking up and admiring the unusually clear night sky. 6-8 lights in a fixed equidistant X shaped array passed overhead very quickly in a straight line on a direct West to East axis direction.  The lights were about as bright as the stars, no brighter, so quite faint. No noise. Passed over very very quickly.  About 2-3 seconds from visible horizon to horizon. Much Faster than a plane or satellite.  Slower than a meteorite. And constant brightness (no flare or fade like a meteorite).  Thought it might be a drone formation given the quick passover speed but it is quiet where we live and there was absolutely no noise so couldn’t be a drone or a plane.  About a minute later two more similar lights passed overhead in an identical path and speed. Keeping same fixed distance between each other.  Then approx a minute or two later, two more lights passed in same trajectory/speed, except this time one of the lights appeared to be dancing with the other - moving closer, further, closer from the other light, like it was playing with it!  Never seen anything like it and got me thinking it was some kind of high altitude meteorological phenomena or hypersonic craft or satellite orbit but I watch the night skies frequently (very amateur astronomer) and I know a satellite flyby is much slower. I was amazed. And got me thinking perhaps Bob Lazar might actually be telling the truth!  Were there any other sightings reported around that time?

White tic-tac shaped UFO stationary, then moves at incredible speed. I was driving to work and was at the corner of Hayden and Frank Lloyd Wright in Scottsdale AZ, driving south on Hayden.  I was waiting at that stop light when I looked to my left and saw this white line in the sky that didn't look right.  I immediately pulled out my phone and pressed the video record button while rolling down the window.  I wanted to be sure it wasn't a reflection off my window.  With the window down it was still visible.  It was not moving.  Just stationary in the sky.  It was a white horizontal line (but the line was tilted) and it seemed to have a bright core.  It looked similar to what you might see with a vapor trail to a jet, however it had a beginning and an end (and the bright core).  Suddenly it moved directly downward and then vanished.  When it moved it seemed not to accelerate, it just sort of ""adopted"" a velocity.  It did not change its angle in the sky when it moved downward, it stayed tilted, just moving straight down.  When its vertical position in the sky got to about the same vertical position as the plane (also in the video) is when it vanished.  It was moving vertically for probably about 2 seconds before it vanished.  When it vanished it did not slowly disappear, but rather seemed to instantly vanish.  I could not park there and video tape it because of the pressing traffic.  As I taped it, I was driving too and sadly, when I reviewed the video, my camera accidentally had panned off of the object as I was driving.  So I missed its downward motion and its vanishing.  On the bright side, my brother analyzed the video frame by frame and noticed that after it vanished it appears again off to the left (North).  At this point it is not a line anymore but just the tic-tac shape.  When I stepped through the video I was able to verify my brother's claim, and in fact the object was visible to me in this video in about 5 frames as the white vehicle moves underneath it.

The weekend of September 26th and 27th of 2020, a friend and I were visiting Lincoln, NH.  I wanted to the see the site thought to be where Betty and Barney Hill were abducted, and my friend wanted to go Geocaching.  On the evening of September 26, 2020, we decided to go to the Pemigewassett overlook, and do a little sky watching.  We got to the overlook after dark, around 8pm.  The weather was partly cloudy, temperature in the mid 50’s, and windy.  We got out a couple of camping chairs and sat to watch the sky.  Around 8:30pm, we noticed a bright red flash on the west edge of a cloud bank that was to our north.  An object emerged from the cloud bank, traveling from west to east.  The object appeared to be triangular, with alternating red and white pulsating lights.  The lights would start at the east edge and alternate red/white moving toward the west edge of the object.  The object was approximately 1000-1500 ft in the air, and was at an approximate 70 degree! angle above the ground.  At that distance, with arm outstretched, the object measured approximately ¼ to 3/8 of an inch.  The pulsating lights made the edges slightly difficult to distinguish. The edge of the object was approximately 1/8 of an inch in height (also slightly difficult to distinguish due to the lights). The object moved slowly from west to east, and was completely silent.  The object was in view for approximately 20 to 30 seconds, and then disappeared into the cloud bank.  While not completely familiar to the area, the object was estimated to be about ¼ of a mile away, based on previously seen landmarks.  Shortly after this object disappeared, a second areal phenomenon was seen. This consisted of a bright, homogeneous, rectangular, white light in the western sky. Unlike, a meteor, the light was homogeneous, did not taper, “unrolled” (similar to how a roll of tape would unroll if it didn’t stick to itself), stayed in this elongated state briefly, and then disa! ppeared all at once. This phenomenon occurred to the west of u! s, and w as oriented (unrolled) from the NW to the SE.  Since I was not familiar with landmarks to the west, it’s difficult to estimate how far away it was, and the altitude, however, it appeared to be higher up in elevation than the triangular object was.  With the arm outstretched, it was located at a 70-80 degree angle above the ground, and measured approximately an inch in length, with a width of approximately 1/8 of an inch. This phenomenon was in view for about 1 second. No noise was associated with this phenomenon.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,44.0797,-71.6326

Approximately two months ago while walking from my house to my vehicle. I looked up briefly and scanned the sky. Taking pause for a moment on a section between a cloud formation, and at A range of about 10,000 ft slightly southwest of my position. I immediately spotted a single black dot with absolutely no identifiable characteristics. Clearly this wasn’t any conventional aircraft I’m am familiar with. This dot caught my attention as it moved out from the cloud for 2 seconds, and then reversing course immediately going back into the cloud. The object continued with this behavior 3 times before a second object of the same size and shape followed it into the adjacent cloud formation.  These radical movements simply could not have been accomplished by any aircraft I’m familiar with.  The speed with which they moved at that altitude was astonishing. I honestly never thought I would see anything in the sky that I was unable to explain to some degree . I did however.

"Two glowing blue objects with pulsing tangerine lights below, suspended absolutely still, in close view; dog agitated","Lake Kinderhook, Niverville Hamlet",NY,2020-10-03T04:00:00,rectangle,15 minutes,"Occurred : 10/3/2020 04:00  (Entered as : 10/03/2020 4:00) Reported: 12/20/2020 4:51:00 AM 04:51 Posted: 12/23/2020 Location: Lake Kinderhook, Niverville Hamlet, NY Shape: Rectangle Duration:15 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/161/S161242.html,"Two glowing blue objects with pulsing tangerine lights below, suspended absolutely still, in close view; dog agitated I live on Lake Kinderhook, New York, in Columbia County. On the night of October 3, 2020, it was cool, so I built a fire in the living room. It was cozy and though a couple of lamps were still burning, I fell asleep on the living room couch. My Shih Tzu Tucker also fell asleep, at my feet.  At 4 a.m. (I checked the time on my laptop computer, which I hadn’t turned off), I was still sound asleep. Tucker woke up and started barking furiously. He only barks when someone comes to the front door…a squirrel on the roof, for example, doesn’t alarm him. He kept barking and ran around the living room and into the sun room, very agitated. I got up and turned the lights out. If someone were in the yard, I didn’t want them to be able to look in and see me. I then moved to the sun room and peered into the front lawn. I saw nobody. Nothing seemed out of place. However, Tucker was still racing around, barking.  I then moved back into the living room and peered outside windows on the left and right of the room. Again, I saw and heard nothing.  Tucker was still barking and acting upset, so I moved into the bathroom adjacent to the living room and peered  through the window into my front yard. From that vantage, across the expanse of my yard, in front of a white garage shed on the next door property, which I also own, there were two identical objects suspended at a height of about 12-14 feet, just under the shed’s roof line. They were small and rectangular, each about 5 feet in length, I’d estimate. They made no noise and were suspended in ""straight line"" formation, exactly parallel. They were eerily still and quiet. The tops of the objects were like very thick bars with very slightly rounded corners. They were a glowing, extremely beautiful blue. I had never seen such a beautiful blue before, Underneath each of the thick blue bars was a row of small circular “thumbprint” lights, a brilliant, also very beautiful, tangerine color. Those lights were pulsing gently, dim-bright, dim-bright.  Tucker was still barking and I was terrified. I was trained in critical thinking, and quickly, I went through a series of possible explanations. I didn’t think they were drones because they were completely still and besides, it was 4 a.m. in a rural area. Who would be operating drones at that time, in our small hamlet? Then I thought of a possible laser projection, but these seemed like solid matter, not holographic, and again, the complete stillness of the suspended objects seemed wrong for a laser projection. Someone would have had to hold a projector; wouldn’t there be at least a slight tremble? Also, someone would have had to project them from someplace on my property, and there was no one there.  I ran into the living room and turned my cellphone on, hoping to take a photo. This takes a couple of minutes, so I left the phone on a coffee table and raced back to the window. The glowing, suspended objects were still there. I did not hear any sounds, but both the dog and I felt hyper-alert at that moment, the way you do when you sense an intruder. I watched them in the dark, then retreated to the living room to get my cellphone. Before I tried to put it on camera setting to take a picture, I made a quick call to our local Troopers and asked them to do a drive-by if they were in the area. I did not want to go into detail and risk being perceived as crazy; all I told the dispatcher was that there were some blue lights on the next door property, my dog was very agitated, and that someone involved in low-level drug activity had once lived on the property and might have returned to search for something. The New Lebanon Barracks said they would send a car.  I went back to the bathroom window then, with my cellphone to take a photo. But the two glowing, suspended objects were no longer there. I did not hear any sound of their leaving. They were just gone. My dog had quit barking, but afterwards he stayed unnaturally close to me, clearly spooked.  When the Troopers came, we walked around the property together and saw nothing.  That would have been the end of it, but a few weeks later, the charge officer of the New Lebanon Barracks called to ask about my report. I had put the event out of my mind, but quickly recalled the events of that night. She asked, “Is there anything else you want to tell us about the blue lights?” When I reported the conversation to my adult daughter, she had the sense that there probably had been other sightings. I just told the officer her troopers had been very professional and thanked her for their trouble. I did not choose to tell her the extent of what I’d seen.  In late November, my daughter visited me from Manhattan. She also paid a visit to her college friend Kait, who lives in a cottage on my lane. Kait told my daughter that she had had an identical sighting a week or two later—but she had seen the still, suspended craft above a field off Route 9 as she was returning home from her teaching job. It was near a local landmark, Period Picks Antiques. The time must have been around 5 p.m.; in New York in November, it gets dark quite early. Kait had pulled off the road and watched the objects for several minutes. Then she drove home. When I talked to her later, she said the objects were the most beautiful glowing shade of blue she had ever seen. That was satisfactory verification, to me, that she had seen the same objects I had. Nine weeks later, I have not seen them again. If my dog had not barked and run around, I would have slept through the whole thing.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,,

I was with my partner in the same bed with my 3 cats. we went to sleep quite late. We both woke up without experiencing any dreams which I thought was weird as I have been having for the last 2 months daily dream recall apart from other UFO sightings and experiences.  My partner decided to sleep and so did I as we felt like we didn't have any sleep or rest, as soon as I slept I started having a lucid dream where I saw my younger self drawing UFO´s that looked like saucers with encryptions on their surface or symbols.  After this I woke up in a sleepy state, I heard a telepathic voice in my head that was a male voice coming from that seemed to be a plasma like being in my room. I wasn't afraid this time as I have had other telepathic communications before this event. As I was still sleepy I wasn't sure what he was doing and it was a bit hard for me to remember everything he said as these experiences of telepathic communication can be a bit overwhelming.  At some point he said to me that he wanted to give me a check up out of love, as in compassion or kindness. As I felt he didn´t have any negative intentions I was ok with it so he then gave me a warning to prepare myself as he would show his real form, I started to see him change shape and sort of wait by my window, I looked to the right where my closet was supposed to be and there was an open doorway with 3 medical staff wearing green or blue medical uniforms waiting at the door for me.  I still felt groggy and walked voluntarily to the door way and entered with room that seemed very white and clean and it wasn't my home anymore, once I realised what was happening to me I started to panic a bit and my heart beat was very fast but I calmed myself down, I felt like they wanted me to go on this metallic bed and as soon as I did that I experienced missing time again and I had no recollection of the checkup that plasma being said he wanted to do but I found myself wondering into another medical room where there was an elderly man on a metal table having some sort of IV drip and then after that I woke up in my bed.  I went to my bedroom window to write my experience in my journal and looked out of my window and saw a white spherical craft in the sky passing by.

I had seen lights exactly like this before several times, all near or above water sources (see my previous post from January 2019 of seeing a diamond shaped craft hovering low over the Connecticut River while traveling home from work in Northampton/Holyoke on rt. 5). For this particular sighting, initially I only saw 1 light. It was definitely not a plane, helicopter, or drone as the light pattern was a rapidly changing almost opal or diamond like random color pattern, not a standard FAA color scheme or pattern that planes and helicopters have. I asked my fiance who was driving at the time if he saw it too and he confirmed that he did. It was not moving in the sky and remained stationary as we headed into Belchertown continuing on Bay Rd. and turned off on our street shortly b! efore Bay Rd. merges onto rt 9. When we got to our home, we could still clearly see the same light from our front yard. It had not moved. We went inside and about an hour later came out again and it was in the same spot. I noticed now that it looked like there was a small helicopter flying near it, like it was observing the strange light from a close distance. It was a much smaller, much dimmer flashing white light next to it. We watched this for another couple of minutes and the strange light began to go from bright, almost sparkling like color shifts to pure blackout (this could have been due to some clouds). It appeared to be right over Quabbin reservoir near the Belchertown/Pelham line which is a few miles from our house. After watching it for a few more minutes, it made a pretty sudden and small shift in direction, looking like it was headed towards us (headed west) in the sky. We could tell it was moving towards us because it got slightly larger in size and brightness! very fast. Once it appeared to have stopped moving, we headed! out bac k (traveling west) towards Bay Rd. to get some food on rt 9 when I looked up and saw that there were actually several of these lights lining what appeared to be the outline of the lower portion of the Quabbin reservoir along rt 9 heading into Ware. I counted about 4 or 5 that were low and close enough that I could see them clearly before we had to turn onto Bay Rd. and they would be completely behind us from the car. The lights seemed to be in a type of line or formation or like I said, lining the reservoirs edge or at least the lower portion of the water from my vantage point.  I had only seen these kinds of lights in a diamond shape per my previous sighting so to see them individually spread out like that was the only difference from my first sighting. The lights/crafts were far enough apart that it couldn't have been 1 craft but rather a series of possible sentinels or smaller crafts hovering over different points along the water. As we headed toward rt 9 via Bay Rd, I noticed another single light like the ones we just saw but it was over the Northampton/Hatfield area. It was also pulsating at a fast rate several different brilliant colors and was also low in the sky. It was the same type of light/craft but by itself, possibly over the Connecticut River. I am not sure why every time I see these lights they are hovering over or traveling along a river or other waterway, but I can't deny what I saw. After seeing the same type of light multiple times, this time having my fiance also see them and confirm what I was seeing/what I said I had seen befor! e, it made me feel like I wasn't crazy and legitimized my/our experience. We are moving to Belchertown shortly and even though this wasn't the first time, I suspect it won't be the last time I see some unexplainable things in the night sky near Quabbin.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,42.2723,-72.402

I am a 22-year-old white female college student studying English and Creative Writing. (Hopefully any talent I have in the field will aid in this description.) I wouldn’t exactly call myself a conspiracy theorist, but I am openly receptive to the idea that there are things among us that we don’t understand. I don’t know if this is pertinent, but I have a background of depression and anxiety, though I was experiencing neither during this event. (Up until I saw the UFO. Then, I will admit, I was very anxious.)  At approximately 19:30 on October 9, 2020, I was sitting alone in my car in a McDonald’s drive-thru on the north side of Terre Haute, Indiana. The sun was setting, but it was still bright out; the sky was a pastel pink. As I waited for the cars ahead of me to move on, I noticed what looked to be two stars hovering in the west—the direction that I was facing. They were bright white pinpricks of light contrasted against the sky. It’s hard to say the shape, simply because they seemed so far away. Upon closer inspection, I could see that at least one of them had a short trail, and in an attempt to reconcile the strange object, I told myself it must be a couple of planes, despite the fact that planes do not emit light in that way.  (The trail was odd looking, too. Not smoke, but it appeared to be made of light.)  The drive-thru line was not long, but long enough for me to stare for a minute or two. Long enough to have noticed any movement, or a direction in which the “planes” were heading, if there was any. But they simply hovered, completely still. The trail that had been left by the one had dissipated in a matter of moments. I pulled out my cell phone and attempted to take pictures, but the points of light were too small for my camera to pick up. At this point, I suspected that it might be a UFO, but had other explanations to put myself at ease, as well. I knew that Mars and Venus were supposed to be bright this month—perhaps that was all I was seeing.  However, as I was focused on the original two points of light, two more appeared. I first noticed the third, and then as my gaze shifted, a fourth. All close together, and all unwaveringly still. I distractedly pulled forward to the pickup window, and accepted my bag of food before pulling out of the parking lot and heading home.  I took Fort Harrison Rd west toward 13th St and continued to anxiously watch the points of light (what I even now struggle to call UFOs) as I drove. So intent on watching them in fact, needing to track any movement and at this point terrified of what it might mean, I was not as focused on the road as I should have been. I made it back to my home in one piece, but only after I told myself to look away and pay attention to what I was doing. I wanted to look around at the other drivers on the road, to see if they were reacting the same way, if they even noticed, but my mind was scattered, and I was far too anxious to do anything but race home.  The moment I arrived back at my house, I headed to the back yard to get a clearer view of the sky, but there were too many trees blocking my view, so I went back in. Sat down. Feverishly Googled what it could be, and found with a blossoming dread that it couldn’t be Mars and Venus. Not only are those planets located in different quadrants of the sky, but are visible only at different times of the day. Perhaps one of the lights I saw was Mars, but that doesn’t explain the other three.  Later that night, I did further research, and was momentarily relieved to find there would be a meteor shower that same night, but the details about the meteor shower didn’t line up with what I saw. According to a local news site, the Draconid meteor shower is small, and one should only expect to “see a few meteors streak across the sky in an hour.” And though the Draconid meteors move slower than those in other showers, they only last “one or two seconds,” which does not account for the several minutes that these UFOs were in my line of sight.  And these could not be stars. Even neglecting the fact that one of them had a trail, nowhere within city limits could you see stars shining that brightly, especially before nightfall. Truly, I would like for there to be some other explanation. But the more I go over the memory of what I saw, the more I’m convinced that the only logical explanation is UFOs. I relayed this experience to a trusted friend who used to live in Arizona, a well-known hub for UFO activity, and she told me that my description matches that of her own experiences. I did a few different Google searches to see if anyone had reported anything similar, but I came up empty-handed. So I decided I had to do it myself, even though thinking about it fills me with that same dread as before.  I don’t think I’ll be getting any sleep tonight.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,39.429084183673474,-87.3756556122449

While in my backyard on the night of 10/07/2020 at approx. 21:30, while looking to the sky for meteors from The Orionids event, I witnessed an abnormal craft pass overhead. The sky was dark overhead with normal city light pollution toward the horizon. I had identified Saturn and Jupiter at approximately 192 degrees S of my position, then Mars at approximately 81 degrees E. I took out my phone and opened my “Star Walk 2” application to help identify any constellations I might be able to see. As I looked away from my phone and into the night sky while facing approximately 40 degrees NE, a fast moving, dull gray in color, orb appeared from approximately 109 degrees E and traveled toward 316 degrees NW. Estimating by relation to the commercial aircraft in the area at that time, the object appeared to be at approximately 20-25,000 feet in altitude. The orb shaped object appeared to be approximately one quarter the size of a commercial airliner (50 feet +/-) in diameter. The object had no flashing lights (of any color) and seemed to “glow” rather than “shine”. It traveled nearly the length of my visible sky in a straight line in approximately 4 seconds. At that 4th second, it made a 90 degree right angle maneuver traveled a split second, then made another 90 degree angle maneuver to the left (which put it back traveling in it’s original direction), before disappearing out of my sight another second later. There is high altitude commercial air traffic in my area, traveling to and from two large airports. These commercial aircraft were traveling approximately, at least, 5 times slower than the object I witnessed. The majority of the flight paths for these airports are perpendicular to the path of the unidentified object I witnessed. The commercial aircraft are easily identifiable by their colored lights, airspeed and direction. I regularly see the Starlink satellites and they too travel in a path perpendicular to this unidentified object, and approximately 100 times slower from my perspective. I immediately checked the viewable time for the International Space Station from my global position and found that it had possibly been visible (dependent on viewing conditions) albeit on a different flight path and approximately an hour and forty minutes earlier. The unidentified object I witnessed by my estimation was traveling at at least 2,000 mph, with no marker light, no sound, and no sonic boom.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,33.93964338565022,-117.4001158071749

I was walking in the evening when I two lights moving in the sky at approximately 19:19 on Oct 9, 2020.  I did a double-take because I live a few miles from the Las Vegas commercial airport and frequently see planes multiple times a minute during take-off and landing.  I also am familiar with the light pattern planes flash when in the sky.  This caught my eye because a plane had just taken off and looked relatively large due to the proximity as it had lifted off the ground maybe 10 seconds prior.  I stopped because there was a bright circular white light I instinctively thought it was a star, but it was directly above the plane moving at the same angle and speed which I have never seen before and instinctively raised an alarm in my head.  I know planes take off somewhere between 130 to 150 mph due to my background and based on the size of the light.  From where I was standing the light looked to be roughly 3x higher on the horizon as I couldn't make a reasonable guess on its height.  The plane was approx. the size of a fingernail from where I was standing while the light was the size of a star in the sky so the scale and speed to which it was moving is a conundrum to me.  My biggest question is how and why two objects(plane and one unknown) were on top of each other. Basic calculations from where I was and the airport takeoff are approx. 6.5 to 7 miles to the east of me for the plane.  Approx. 4 seconds after I noticed the plane and the other object in the sky, the unknown star looking object stopped completely and was isolated/suspended in the air while the plane continued on its path.  After approx. 2 seconds after the light stopped it started to dim to the point where it was barely visible in the span of approx. 2 more seconds. Still suspended in the air the dim light sat for approx. another 5 sec and increased its brightness again for approx. 2 sec. after another approx. 2 seconds it dimmed again and I looked away to search for any context as to what, where, how it could be, I looked away for less than a second, and when I looked back the object had vanished.  Given the speed and rate of the object’s path earlier and that it was somewhat easy to spot in the sky, I can not fathom how an object can completely disappear in the matter of a second after being stationary for so long.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

We got to the end of the neighbourhood. We parked to look at it and it just disappeared.  I’ve never seen something like that.,2020-12-23T00:00:00,49.891260040733194,-97.15285022403258

One object appeared as a horizontally long oval (width only slightly bigger than height) with a light green glowing aura surrounding it. The object was going in a downward direction quickly and was fireball-like. One witness still saw the object behind trees on the horizon until it disappeared. The object appeared to be a few miles away in the southwest direction.  Between the time that the first witness saw the object and the disappearance was approximately twenty seconds. This sighting occurred while setting up a telescope (but not viewed through the telescope as it happened too quickly to attempt to view it and we did not want to look away) and no other unusual objects were noticed before or after this.  Both witnesses are not astronomy experts, but beginners with an interest in space. One witness observed meteors from the Persoid meteor showers in August. To compare to the meteors observed then, this object was much bigger, closer, slower, going in a downward direction (as opposed the meteors which went across the sky). Airplanes were the only other moving objects in the sky observed that night. However, this object also did not appear to be an airplane (the unidentified object was bigger, did not appear to have an airplane shape, and an airplane would not have been flying downward as fast).",2020-12-23T00:00:00,,
