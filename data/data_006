I happened to look out kitchen window and saw two orange fiery balls hovering just above the horizon.  I grabbed by video camera and filmed them.  Only a short time did both appear together as the one on left was lower and believe the tree line blocked clear view.  They did not move forward or back or up or down only when they finally disappeared as they seemed to slowly lower and sink into the horizon. The object can be seen clearly and rotating, I think counter clockwise. You can clearly see gases or image like fire encircling the objects. They appear like giant asteroids but how could they appear so close and yet not enter the atmosphere.  I have NEVER seen nor witnessed anything like it.  You can hear the dogs howl and whine in fear of whatever it was.  I tried to call local news etc., but guess they think I'm nuts.

It looked like it landed in north Kent.  It had all the characteristics and trajectory of a meteorite except it was a little slow for a meteorite, but I think that may be explained if it were moving toward or away from me.  It did seem to be low in the sky (I could see it at the top of my windshield and it ended up about half way down on the right side. I have seen one or two like it before in my life except they were not green.  It did not do anything funny like stopping or changing direction.

It was traveling over the Indianola area (Miller Bay), toward Saquamish and Bainbridge Island, south-west at 21:19-21:28.  There was also a bright white/green white strobe with every third blink of the red light.  Quiet and huge in width, height unknown, speed hard to estimate not knowing the height or actual size.  It did travel at a constant speed. Looking out my window in a south-west direction a very large object with lights caught my attention passing over our budding alder tree.  I jumped up looked out my window and spotted 3 steady bright white lights lined up in a straight line and evenly spaced to my upper left still moving in a south-west direction overhead. I looked at my watch and it read 9:19pm.  The center steady white light had a blinking red light near it and an additional whitish or slightly greenish strobe.  The whitish light flashed with every third or so red flash.  The red light flashed once every other second or so.  I grabbed our W.W.II tank binoculars mounted on a tripod and checked it out.  It was really wide, a lot wider and larger than any plane I have ever seen here, I could not establish what the objects shape was, I could only see the line of lights.  I ran out onto the balcony and did not hear engines, then I ran back into living room and watching with the binoculars as it disappeared into a long white wispy cloud. There were very few clouds in the south-west sky. I looked at my watch and now it read 9:23pm. I called my wife in San Diego and told her what I saw, while keeping my eyes on the cloud.  I thought it had gone, when all of a sudden it reemerged on the far side of the cloud (the south-west side) and made a left turn.  I again looked at my watch and now it read 09:28.  I followed it with the binoculars until it faded after what seemed to be 3-4 minutes.  I forgot to look at my watch this time because I ran into the den, grabbed a compass and ran back into the living room.  I established the course heading at approximately 200-210 degrees on the south-west leg from 9:19-9:23pm.  When it came out of the cloud at 09:28pm and changed its course to the left, I approximated the left turn to be about 60 degrees. That is a really rough guess.  I approximated using existing land marks, my compass, estimated time and the objects diminishing relative size.  I am still not sure just how high it was but it was big. There were small plane passing between me and the cloud the object disappeared into and they were really dwarfed in comparison to the width of the line of lights, probably about a 15:1 ratio.",1999-04-26T00:00:00,47.7505,-122.5373

I was awakened by what I thought was a car pulling into the parking lot.  (no car to be seen)  I looked around 360 degrees 2x.  The 2nd time I saw a shooting star and a big fire ball type of object simultanously.  It seemed to be steaming, and was pulsating.  I thought I was looking at a fire at first by the color but I realized it wasnt.  I became mesmerized while staring at it and then my adrenalin started flowing.  It/they  (what ever)  calmed me down with a internalized voice I thought at the time was my own.  ""Go back to sleep, your cold, tired, it's just a metiorite, it's nothing , look in the morning when it's not so cold""  Then I layed down, next thing I knew I was sitting up in my sleeping bag again watching this ""thing"" fading away.  In the morning I wake up feeling exhausted and very depressed and I thought it was strange that I should feel that way...I had no recollection until two days later when I was driving and looking at the colors of the sunset and I saw a meteorite...then I remembered.  I think that I remember only part of the event, and I don't know for sure the exact time or duration. It was a calm wind night, the first night I had camped all season long (windsurf season, in the gorge), that we had frost on the car.  The object didn't have a definite shape that I could make out.  My first impression was ""It's a forest fire""  but then  I realized that there were only about four trees surrounding it and they were not burning.  I also noticed that there was absolutely no sounds at all.  Dead silence.  There appeared to be steam arising from it and it's brilliant red orange glow kind of oscillated.  The steam was blowing towards the east as it was a prevailing west wind the whole weekend. (this happened very early sunday morning.)  As I sat watching, I couldn't take my eyes off it.  The steam or smoke dissapated and no more came from the object.  It continued to glow (pulsating) and I stared for I dont know how long.  pWhen I realized it wasn't a fire my mind tried  frantically to come up with an explaination of what I was observing.  I laughed to my self at the burning trees and thought ""....and moses only saw burning bushes"".  When I thought of the possibilities, UFO did come to my mind but not until I exhasted the most rational things I could come up with first like meteorite, or fire or ? anything!  I got really frightened and went into the fight or flight mode, when I was suddenely so calm it was as if I were drugged.  I think I was aware at the time that something outside of myself was calming me down, and that scared me even more.  Like I said before I still don't remember the whole complete thing, because there was a time when I started to lay down because I couldn't fight it anymore. (I tried!!!) and the next thing I can remember I was sitting up watching the light and it slowly ,over the period of a few minutes just got smaller and dissapeared.  The height of the glow of the light was at least 60 feet.  It was just as long and the whole glow was circular as far as I could tell.  I wasa parked aproxamately 30 feet away.  There was no noise and no smell.  There were no little green! men either.  I didn't see any kind of beings at all.  I did feel like someone was inside my mind with me.  No, I'm not crazy!  I was camped with 3 other vehicles.  I was in my subaru wagon, by myself.  My friend was in his ford utility truck, right belind me a blue old toyota and our friend in his voltswagon camper van.  I eventually asked all of them about that night and if they remembered anything.  I think I was the only one to either see or at least remember.

I saw the triange 18 years ago! Dear Peter Davenport, One evening between Nov. 1981 and Feb. 1982 at around 8 PM., I was driving home from work, northeast on route 94 in Vernon, NJ towards home in Warwick, NY. I saw what I thought was a 747 ahead of me to my left. It had a red and a green and a white light. I paid it little attention. As I proceeded, I saw a huge solid triangular craft through the bare trees in the sky not far above the tree line. The triangle was traveling way too slow to stay up in the sky; I’d say about 20 M.P.H. As the craft came closer (it approached at a position of about ten o’clock) each of its three corners were now illuminated with only one white light. I rolled down my window to listen because it should have been deafeningly loud at that point. As it passed overhead, I could not believe my ears - it was completely silent and there were no lights anymore, just a dark triangular shape. I had never seen anything so massive. As big as a football field was how I explained the triangle’s size to the police. The body was darker than the night sky behind it although I could not make out the craft itself. Immediately to my right was the steep incline of mountains. The craft rapidly accelerated in an upwards motion in order to clear the mountain range and lifted in a manner that I have never seen any aircraft maneuver - sort of like when you make your bed with someone and raise the sheet by all four corners quickly, then air gets trapped under it and it sort of floats down slower. My engine was still running, so I sped home where I immediately called the Vernon New Jersey Police Department. I gave them my story and asked how many others had called in, but to my amazement, he said no one else had called at that time. I never took UFOs seriously before. For years I kept this incident to myself because I had no explanation and I felt terribly alone and confused. Now, after reading Dr. J. Allen Hyneck’s NIGHT SIEGE and hearing your reports on Art Bell, I know that others have seen exactly what I had seen 18 years ago. What I found out recently, was that in 1985, my brother had also seen a UFO. I asked him to write down his experience for me. Here it is: March/April, 1985, 8-10PM Main Building, Housing Unit 9-2, Fishkill Corrections Facility, Beacon, NY As I worked one night in Housing Unit 9-2, which is a dorm-style ward, an inmate approached me at my desk and told me to look out the window facing one of the facility’s exercise yards. The window was open except for the bars. Directly over the yard and approximately 100-150 yards in the air I saw what appeared to be a circle of bright white lights which illuminated the yard below. As I watched for nearly 3-5 minutes, the circle of lights remained motionless and completely void of any noise. Eventually, the circle of lights began to move slowly over the unit in a northerly direction. It was then that I went into the hallway outside of the unit and watched there from one of the windows as the circle of lights moved slowly towards and eventually over Interstate 84. During this time trucks and cars traveling on Interstate 84 either slowed to a crawl or stopped altogether to watch as the lights passed overhead. When the other C.O.s and I questioned our supervisors about this, we were informed that what we saw was a group of planes out of Stewart Air Force Base flying in close formation.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,41.189,-74.4911

I thought it was some kind of firefly but when I looked directly at it I saw that it was on one edge of a black silhouetted cigar shaped object.  It reminded me of a weapon discharge such as a machine gun.  It was 'firing' in the same direction of travel as the object and appeared to be slowing the object down as if it were a retrorocket.  The object (which I estimated to be large...at least several hundred feet long) slowed to a halt over the hill.  The blue-white light ceased to discharge.  After a few seconds it slowly descended behind the hill and out of sight (there is a valley there where the Ludlow River (it may be called the Chicopee River actually) flows.  I watched for hours but it never came up into view again.  I had heard that the Ludlow police had seen it in a different area that night at about 3am but never verified this in newspapers recently.

I went inside and got my SLR camera & 400mm lens.  I went back out and looked at the remaining light, but the strong lens showed revealed no shape behind the light.  The other two lights now began to emerge from the clouds and the formation of the three was now close to linear and vertical.  I would estimate their distance to be about 2-3 miles.  I couldn't tell if they were making any sound because a helicopter was hovering 1.3 miles to the west, over the football stadium.  The orange lights had no accompanying aircraft-style strobes or red/blue positioning lights.  They did not move constantly, as a sattelite would and! the cloud cover was dense enough to obscure anything that high or faint.  I am 34 and I am quite familiar with the way civil and military aircraft move.  These lights moved similarly to helicopters, but had no regulation lights and didn't generate the sounds that a group of 3 military helicopters would make.  I asked a neighbor to look at them.

I had been working on a car and was at this time test driving it.  The event occoured at 20:47.  I was driving and looking at the stars since it was a CLEAR night. (visibility only distorted by minor upper- atmosphere turbulence)  I then noticed the object.  It caught my eye because of it's intense brightness.  I stared at it allowing myself to accuire a good sight of the object.  It possessed the likeness of a comet.  It was shaped as a ""tear-drop"".  It turned out a tremendous light.  Even brighter than the moon on it's most radiant nights.  It's light was pure white with no distortion apparent.  There is a tall radio antenna with warning strobe lights situated on it; however, this is not at all what I witnessed.  The object, though described as a comet had none of a comet's properties; i.e.  A tail, haze behind the comet, small size and the other distinguishing features of a comet.  The object not only very brigh! t but also seemed to be very low (between 1,000 to 3,000') and able to acchieve great speed.  The object was headed west on about a 280 degree heading.   Although I was driving between 75-80mph it seemed to pull away from me unlike anything I have ever seen.  I attempted to try and keep up with it but I lost sight of it  when The trees alongside the road blocked my vision of the object.   Make note I live near an airport and I used to live near an Air Force base.  I know how planes fly and I know the acceleration an airplane can obtain.  But as this object was 5-8mi.s out.  For an airplane to accelerate such as this thing did it and to dissapear from my field of view it would have to have an extrodinary engine, acceleration rate, and exaust hider (afterburner, it would be needed if this were even to be tried).  I have NEVER seen such a feat.  This event escapes my mind.  I have been made fun of and discredited even by almost everyone, including friends.

Flashing green and red lights, not much movement, but aparently a UFO because it was gone less than an hour later.  Had small movements, but kept generally steady and remained in the same location for over a half hour. The object was a white light with green and red flashing lights.  The white light appered to blink on and off, or just different brightness.  Well I was sitting at a local school at about midnight when I looked up and noticed the flashing lights.  When I began to study it more, I noticed that it was not a plane because it wasn't moving.  I thought that I saw it moving up and down swiflty but not more than just a little, so maybe my eyes were just shifting.  Then I thought that it was just a star blinking.  So I called the police department, and they told me serveral other people had reported the same incident.  Well, I wasn't sure then.  I got a friend and showed him, he didn't believe that it was a UFO, he said it was just a star.  So I gave it up, I mean who would believe that I saw a UFO anyways.  So I went on AOL for a while, and I went back out to check it at 2:30 am, and it was gone.  No trace of the object anywhere.  How many stars can disappear like that.  So I came ! here to report it as soon as I was convinced. As far as I know, there was only one object.  I only saw one that is.  And it really didn't have any shape.  I mean it did look like it was very far away.  A coulpe of things, there was another star on the west horizon, which the police thought I was seeing, and it wasn't it.

While I was sitting there I happened to look to the northwest where I saw what looked like four large, very bright white lights in the sky at about 30 degrees. It appeared that they were about one or two miles away from where I was, probably somewhere around 43 ave. or 51 ave. and Olive. These lights appeared to me to be in the shape of a very large diamond they were as bright as and maybe even brighter than those you would see on a commerical jet airliner. When I first saw them they were coming straight down out of the sky in a verical direction. I thought at first that they were the nose, wing, and tail lights of a large jet crashing into the ground, but what was really strange about this was that they were moving downward very slowly. As the lights came down closer to the ground they began to disappear behind the houses in the area, I was thinking to myself that very soon I would be seeing a large fireball in the sky from the crash, but it never happened. As I sat there thinking about what I had seen I decided that it was not a jet crashing because it was moving to slowly. I also decided that it was not helecopters because all of the lights moved downward at exactly the same speed, it did not look like flares because all of the lights were of the same intensity and were a bright white color more like you would see on a jet for it's landing lights, except much bigger and brighter. I could not see the body of any craft partly because the lights were so bright but also because it was so far away from me. I do remember that as I was looking at it thinking it was a jet crashing, I thought that it looked to big to be a jet, at that distance it would have been at least 10 times larger than a jet. A couple of days after this happened I was talking to my mother and told! her what I had seen, after I told her about it she told me that she had just seen on the local TV news a story about the ""Phoenix Lights"" that so many people all over the valley had seen on that same night.

I should have stopped because we were passing by and my sister was in the car reading and did not look up until I  started yelling 'Did you see it?!? Did you see it?!?' By that time, the saucer was obscured by the trees, but she did see the very bright light. I turned around as soon as I could to come back for a second look but it was gone.

Being a person with a rational mind I ran inside and told my wife, and mother to come see. I realized that a multiple sighting would have more weight than a single eye witness account. They rushed outside and I had them look in the area of the object.  I was actually suprised it was still there 3 min must have passed since I first saw it.  ""I thought it could be a weather balloon"" My mother has poor eyesight and can not see even with the help of her glasses.  My wife could not see it until it emitted a orange glow from underneath that lasted about 1.5 sec.  That helped her focus in on the object.  Shortly after it emitted a blue orange glow underneath and went up out of the atmosphere. Out of site. No sound was heard during the whole event and it was quite windy.  The object never diviated from it's local position, was not affected by the wind.  At that point I desided it wasn't a weather balloon I continued to scan the sky about 1 minute after the object left the atmosphere a military jet flew into the area where the object was and circled as if searching for something then it left. Usually jets don't fly in our area that low.  I then called the local MUFON group and and told them what I saw.  They blew me off.

I was looking at the sky, toward the north, at around 11:30 pm.  The sky was very clear and I was looking at a group of stars that seemed to be in the shape of the little dipper, but it was neither the big or little dipper.  This grouping of stars was much smaller.  Aproximately 1/10 th the size.  As I was looking at the stars one seemed to just disappear as if sucked into the darkness.  I thought this was funny and Iblinked and kind of shook my head to make sure I wasn't seeing things and when I looked up again the place were the star or so I thought was a star was just darkness.  I looked at my friend and said did you see that.  He had not seen this so we started to watch the sky in this area.  Within a minute of seeing the star or whatever it was disappear we both saw a light flash.  The light was kind of an off white color almost like the color of light produce by a house lamp.  This light was in the sky next to where the star/UFO was but the light I noticed when it flashed was quick and concentrated, not like glare you may see coming from a light source.  About a minute later we saw another flash in the same general area and of the same nature as before. This went on for about 3 minutes.  All three flashes were in the same general area according to our location.  Then the flashes stopped. My mind at this point didn't know what to really make of it at the time but I kept watching to hopefully see something else to make some sense of it.  With in a minute or two  we saw a streek in the sky of the same color light as the flashes but the streek was moving in an S-shaped pattern.  I drove home that night scared out of my whits and a little excited.  There was no aircraft in the area and nothing unusual about the night except for the light.  The light was farther away as in out of the atmoshere of the earth or right at the edge of the atmoshere.  Up until a few months ago I never really thought much of it other than I couldn't explain it.  I was watch a ! documentory on U.F.O.'s and they showed one that took on this S-shaped pattern and one that seemed to become longer and then shorted as it moved.

As we were traveling along 148th (Lake Youngs Road) southwards  we had just gone past 224th,   It was a cold clear night, moonless, I was leaning my head against the door glass watching the stars when I saw the object.  At first I thought it was a reflection on the glass because the image was faint.  I had my husband turn off the interrior lights and it was still there.  I couldn't hear anything so I had him turn off the radio. I rolled down the window.   It wasn't making any sound at all.  It was staying with us as we drove along.  My husband never saw it because of it's angle to the roof of the car.  I wouldn't have seen it myself if I hadn't been leaning against the window looking straight up.  When we came the stop sign where 148th crosses 240th street I watched the object go on over the hill.  In 1974 there were no houses up there.  I heaved a sigh of reliefe because this really spooked me.  Then as we were coming up on the stop sign at 256th a light caught my attention.  It was the object again.  This time coming at us head on about 30 feef off the ground.  We were stopped at the stop sign at this point and I paniced because at the nose of the object was what appeared a wide wind screen, with phosphorus green light emitting with the shape of a  humanoid in the middle.  I screamed at my husband to get us out of there.  He took off with tires screaming,  I lost my memory of the trip home from this point.  The next thing I remember is coming up on the stop sign at highway 18 on Wax Road.  I am completely calm, not worried or anxious.  We arrived home about 5 minutes later.  I took our baby son into his room and put him to bed and then took myself to our room.  The clock on the side of the bed said 3:18 A.M.  This trip we took from our friends home would take 20 minutes any day of the week, day or night.  We had lost 2 hours.  But I managed to convince myself that I must have read the clock wrong before! we left Renton.  I didn't know anything about UFO's or their characteristics at the time and it was easy to write off as just a strange incident in our lives.  After I filed my previous report (9/6/97 incident) I was just browsing your sight.  I read the report of the UFO Flap of 73, the Coyne Hellicopter Incident on 10/18 73 and  just freaked when I read the discription of the object.  It sounds so much like the object I saw on that cold January night.  I asked in my last report for someone to call me.

I am not sure of the year or date, it was after midnight, somewhere between 1969-72, I was very young maybe 8-10 years old, parents withnessed. We came home from my aunt and uncle and it was no other vehicle around. When I saw it, I told my parents to stop the car and shut the lights off. I felt instinctivily it was what we had to do. We wached the objects flowing over the small mountain range for maybe 3-4 minutes. It was absoluttelly silent. They were quite distant, but anyway, the winter night and cold had brought sound if there were any. SInce this wasn't any fantasy objects, and no outrageing things beyond this happend, I believe it is a trustworthy sight, and not some exagerated nonsens. No big deal, but we saw them. They were not aviation or other. Just three ufo, that's that. No sound, clear winter cold sky. --  --  -- formation, firetails which started somewhere in the midle of the crafts could have been from a jet, but it wasn't. The speed of diseapearance was to fast, and they just went straight up to the universe in a faster than eye flash. Well, it was not a special thing beside of I saw what I saw, and can't denie the fact, but we was a little stunned I remember. I wonder if there were more sightings in norway that time around that area, close to the Swedish border, about two hours drive from Oslo(pretty deserted at that time, forests). I do not believe in anything before I see it, and I saw it. The crafts moved from the right to the left at the nightsky, and all held the same tempo. They also vertically went straigh up in the same formation, but this time the first one at the first, and the next one , and the next, like a neckless. It looked like they took of upwards without changing the horizontal position of the crafts, like that modern airforce jet which can lift veritcal stright up. The crafts was never landing, just flying (flowing) and then svishh....I am sure no planes ever have been built to have that speed of accellaration in just less than a second, then or now. Well, this isn't ! a big record to remember, but I thought I just mention it. I am a sceptic so I really never speak much about such things, but I know we are not alone anyway. Any intelligent non arrogant person should understand that. The color was light yellow glowing like any distant light for instance from a strong light and not changing, so was the fire tails but you could clearly see what was the firetails, since the object moved.

Earlier this week I heard Peter Davenport on Art Bell's program and heard the woman who saw the object near Lake Arrowhead.  I didn't hear a lot of what she said because there was a lot of static.  It reminded me of a situation that happened to me about 2 years ago in the same area.   I left Lake Arrowhead and I was heading down the mountain.  When I got on Highway 18 I saw this round glowing object nearby on the lefthand side of the road.  At first I thought it was the moon and I remember thinking that it was so pretty and so close.  Then, and I'm embarrassed to say this, I realized that it wasn't the moon because I was heading west not east.  This object kept pace with me and it was playing games and taunting me at the same time.  When I speeded up to get a better look it moved away but still kept the same distance between us.  Then I realized I was witnessing something quite interesting and certainly not a normal occurence.  It was rather large too.  The next weekend I went back to Lake Arrowhead.  I went into the Stater Brothers market to talk to Sharon who worked in the bakery department because I wanted to tell her about my experience with the object.  She got this knowing smile and said, ""Oh you saw it"".  I said ""yes"" and asked her what it is.  She said these glowing objects/balls come up along the road.  (I must say if you have never driven Highway 18 it is very winding and there is the mountain on one side and the valley below.  It is a very spectacular sight from this road).  So they come up along the valley side of the road.  She said that these objects appear to selected people, they are friendly, and they are communicating with us telepathically, teaching us and warning us. She said they appear quite regularly to selected people.  Anyway, I thought this might help you to piece together a pattern because I know there have been quite a few sightings near Lake Arrowhead, Running Springs and Crestline.",,34.2726,-117.19679999999998

This report is from my first experience - or at least the first one I clearly remember. I had recently turned 5, so the exact date & time are approximations, but I clearly remember the year, and that it was just a few days before Christmas. While asleep in my room that night, I saw a rather bright bluish-white light come in through the window. It was much brighter than the moon would make. I got up out of bed and went to see what it was.  As soon as I went into the beam and looked up, I became paralyzed and unable to move. The object was about 2x to 3x the apparent size of a full moon, and was shaped kind of like a half-moon, but it was tilted at a bizarre angle, and the flat side wasn't flat at all - it had a scalloped appearance like you'd see on the tops of ancient medieval castle towers. Although it was difficult to judge height & distance because I was so young, I'd guess now that it was hovering about 50' above the ground at a distance a distance of 150' to 300' away.  This would make the object around 20' in length by 15' in height - but these are only rough guesses.  There's no way to know for certain how long the object was there, but my best guess would put it at about 15 to 30 minutes. Immediately after the sighting, my hearing seemed to become very sensitive. Small objects like pins falling to the floor sounded like pieces of rebar being slammed into concrete; I also remember feeling what I might now call an altered sense of reality. From that point on, I'd start having these strange, almost dream-like periods that would always begin the same: a series of rectangular shapes colored in bright yellows, greens, and blues would appear and rapidly superimpose themselves upon one another in my visual field. After a moment or two, a small area of intense, scintillating green would appear near the center; followed almost immediately by the paralysis, the apparent enhancements in my hearing, and an overwhelming feeling of terror. This ""thing"" would happen almost every day; usually at night but sometimes while wide awake during the day. It wasn't until many years later before I learned a way to ""control"" or ""stop"" these in their intial stages, and eventually the incidents of them slowed to the point where they only occur very rarely anymore.",,58.53633908045977,-134.71346206896553

I began to think about what I had seen and decided to say something.... I was driving west on Rt. 50 toward Fairfax.  My friend and I both spotted this thing ""hovering"" over Rt. 50, with lights that seem to revolve around the center of it.  We slowed down to look at it.  It looked like a blimp, but wasn't.

Got up to change channel on TV and was drwn towards the window by bright orange glowing objects outside and to the south behind the church. Six Objects in formation. One other that was much lower and cruising appoximately one hundred feet above the power lines. They came over the apartments where I was living and I could see them quite clearly from the center courtyard second floor catwalk. They (6) stopped in mid flight just when passing to my direct west and abruptly changed direction from due north to west. I'd say that they were each about the size of a quarter at arms length away from the body. The rogue ship that was lower never did come up above the horizon from where I was watching this. At this point a neighbor was awakened by what he thought was an explosion and came outside to where I was standing with another person to watch the sighting. I did not hear any noise from the objects during the ten minutes that they were in my complete view. As they ascended at 45 degrees azimuth they seemed to be shooting sparks out from the rear and I could see small silvery disks being ejected from the object that were not illuminated except from the orange glow of the UFO. They quickly were lost sight of after they descended into the darkness. At this time three other presons were returning home from a late night poker game and immediately came up the catwalk to see what was going on. This was approximately 8 minutes after they were first spotted by myself. The next day I talked to another of my neighbors who also witnessed it but was too frightened to come outside and watch it with us. After nine minutes of observation the two objects to the right and left of the center object blinked out. The remaining two objects sped off at a fantastic rate of speed. I could still see them for only a few more seconds before they were out of my vision range.  After the sighting was over we called the local radio station (KGIL) to report the sighting. The overnight board operator said that he received one other report from someone in Van Nuys, CA. The next morning, we called the local US Air Force to report the sighting. the officer told us, ""We do not know what they are."" Also, I observed a LAPD patrol car going down Vanowen St. at Ethel Avenue to the West. I not sure if he saw it too. But, I think that it would have been very visible to anyone that managed to be outside and looking up. I managed to somehow snap a single photo from a Kodak instamatic 126 camera of a single object. It was not very impressive! But, I still have the negative available. Unfortunately, I didn't remember taking the photograph until four years later!

I was armed and never once did I think of shooting at the object.  For me it was all time had stood still for this brief moment.  The object turned it's lights off and stayed hovering above the trees and me for a few more seconds and then it just suddenly took off at a speed unimaginable.  Then, i didn't understand it, but today I would consider it a blessing, to view these objects.  And I would live all these years never forgetting.  The siting in Pgh. and in Ga are just two of many I would go on to witness..  My next siting would occur in Texas, some time later, at Lake Belton, in Belton County, TX.  This siting was a cigar shaped object and looked like a lit up bus.  There was no sound as it passed over head.  Then, as with now there was no known technology, that could explain these events. I know, firsthand, because I was in the Military Intelligence community at the time and viewed all known Strategic Initiative Technologies, under the then Jimmy Carter, (Carter) Administration.  I would then and now still look to the skies, for more events i have witnessed in my youth. In Georgia the shape was a fireball at first.  And upon my closer encounter, it was rectangular in shape.

Deep black sphere about 1 meter diameter emits paralyzing orange beam,Juneau,AK,1982-06-15T14:00:00,sphere,10-15 minutes,"Occurred : 6/15/1982 14:00  (Entered as : 06/15/82 14:00) Reported: 10/24/1999 16:16 Posted: 11/2/1999 Location: Juneau, AK Shape: Sphere Duration:10-15 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/010/S10339.html,"Deep black sphere about 1 meter diameter emits paralyzing orange beam This sighting is from 1982. At that time I lived in the Juneau Receiving Home, awaiting foster care. Around 2 in the afternoon on a mid-June day, I had stepped out back for a cigarette.  In the back of this home was the driveway, a freestanding garage, and a dipsty dumpster. A woodland area surrounded the whole back side.  About 100' from the porch and well into the wooded area lies a 10'x10' patch of concrete with a basketball hoop on it. When I stepped out, I noticed a deep black globe, about 3 feet in diameter, hovering in place about 80' away and 18"" or so off the ground - right near the front edge of the basketball court.  The sphere was a pure black, almost as if it were a hole in space; yet I could tell it was fully 3-D and very real. Almost immediately after I noticed it, the sphere started drifting smoothly towards my right at about half a mile an hour. A low humming noise became evident at this point. The sound could be best described as the sound effect they use on Star Trek Voyager to indicate power going to the warp core; but it seemed lower and more intense. The object then emitted an intense, fan-shaped orange beam of some kind, directed towards my right; but sweeping slowly from right to left. As the beam swept past, objects in its path (tires, pop cans, etc.) glowed a kind of phosphorescent orange color; while the general background was darker. At this point I was more than concerned; I became somewhat frightened. When I turned towards the back door and reached for the doorknob (still looking at the sphere), the beam hit me, paralyzing me where I stood. And that's the last thing I remember, until finding myself back in my room some minutes later wondering just what the hell had happened. Just before this sighting occured, I had been trying to record shortwave radio broadcasts on my new JVC RC-M70 boombox. The tape was still running after the sighting - so being the curious person I was, I played my tape back.  At first, all I heard was what I expected: static-filled shortwave broadcasts. About 20 minutes into the tape, these broadcasts were replaced by a very odd warbling noise, modulated and remodulated with all kinds of harmonics; rising and lowering in general pitch with a period of about 20 seconds.This sound lasted for about fifteen minutes; after which the usual static & faint shortwave station sounds resumed. Sometime between 1982 and 1990 the tape became lost though.  I sure wish it hadn't. There were no apparent physical effects from this encounter; although those strange paralyzing ""dreams"" from a previous sighting came back for a few weeks afterwards. The object didn't appear to be suspended by string or wire; the general terrain in that area would have absolutely forbidden any means of support for the kind of smooth, natural movement it had.  Not from above, not from the sides, and not from below.  My opinion of the object was that it may have been a probe of some kind; it was too small to have been a ship and it most definately wasn't a balloon. I never found out what happened to it; for it was already gone by the time I realised what had happened. Back during this time period, I was messing with lasers and electronics; and had constructed a device which produced some unusual EM effects; however this device had not been in operation for about a year before the sphere showed up; so I found no obvious connection between the two.",1999-11-02T00:00:00,58.53633908045977,-134.71346206896553

We were first contacted Saturday night, January 7, 1995, by an Operations Officer in TEMA, who reported to us that the event had occurred, and that their offices had been activated, as a result of the strange event, and subsequent explosion.  The latter was so dramatic that a member of the local aviation community, who had witnessed the event, immediately following the explosion, drove to the airport and took off in an aircraft to search for what he was certain had been an airliner that had exploded in midair.   TEMA contacted the U. S. Air Force, apparently informing them that a possible UFO event had occurred, and inquiring what TEMA should do.  According to the TEMA official we spoke with, TEMA was informed by the USAF to contact the National UFO Reporting Center.  TEMA did contact our Center by telephone, and faxed to our offices a seven-page document, written by a Warren County Deputy Sheriff, in which that officer describeded the explosion, according to eyewitnesses.

I walked out the frontdoor of my home to my car to go to work at approximately 0800 hours.I was facing the east.The weather was sunny but with just a few light,scattered clouds.The clouds were no hindrance to visibility.As I proceeded to my car,I looked up to the north-northeast sky and observed a large,purple object (one only) that sent cold chills down my spine.It appeared to be moving very slowly over the southeastern corner of Lake Hefner in a southerly direction and then turning to the southeast.The speed was similar to the speed of a blimp.The altitude was less than 1000 feet.It appeared to be at a distance of approximately no more than 1 to 2 miles.It was completely silent.I was in a state of disbelief or denial about what it might be.I was trying in my mind to tell myself it was something manmade.I also knew for certain that it was not an airplane as I am familiar with the physics of airplane flight due to the type of work I do and who I work for.It would have stalled out as big and slow as it was moving.Next I tryed to tell myself it was a blimp,but I am familiar with say,the GOODYEAR blimp,and it was not that due to the coloring.It had bluish looking panels going around the craft in the middle laterally.They appeared to be flashing to a degree.I wondered if it might be some sort of advertising device on a blimp.I told myself it was very odd looking but beautiful for a blimp.It was very strange because that was the only lights on it.No beacon lights(red,white,or green) were observed that a normal craft would have.As I was observing it`s motion,I yelled for my wife to come outside,which she did.I pointed it out to her and she also saw it,along with my granddaughter,who also observed it.I said ""keep an eye on it and I will run back in the house to get a camera"".I did this but could not find the camera.This took no more than 30 seconds.I ran back outside and it had disappeared.I asked,""Where did it go?"" My wife said it accelerated so fast it appeared to just disappear.We asked ourselves what coul! d it have been.The complete time of the event was no more than 2 minutes.First,it was definitely not a plane.The HARRIER jet is the only plane I know of that could move like that and it was not in the shape of a plane.Secondly,if it was a blimp,how could it just disappear like that?? I have watched blimps land or accelerate and it takes a little more time to accomplish than the 30 seconds I was in the house.I listened to the radio and checked the newspapers and never heard anyone else report this event.I am at a loss to know what we observed!My background is:Machinist for the U.S.AIRFORCE for 28 years and 53 years old.My wife is a clerk for the OKLAHOMA ((deleted)) and 2 years younger than me.My granddaighter is 8 years old.I dont use any type of alcohol or drugs, nor anyone else in my family.I can report that we all were very sober for this occurrence.I regret not having the date of this event nor any photos of the craft.Also I wished I could have reported the event sooner.I hope that by telling of this occurrence to someone who knows something of UFO`s that it will help me to purge my mind of the frequent question I ask myself:""What did we see?"" and I hope that maybe someone may have seen something similar to this somewhere.If you are able to help,I would be very grateful!",,35.47186177914111,-97.52630349693251

The sky was very clear and we could see lots of other stars, but this one was slightly larger, and moving slowly.  At first most of us thought it was some sort of satellite and I remember we were all pretty casual about it.  We watched it for at least ten minutes, travelling from East to West, fully expecting it to keep going until it disappeared.  Then to our astonishment it stopped and two smaller ""stars"" appeared either side.  They shot out accross the sky in different directions at fantastic speeds, before returning to the bigger ""star"" then repeating the excercise over and over again. I remember we were all stunned,as we had absolutely no idea what it was we were watching. Others were starting to get excited and some were getting nervous. I just stayed with my family and kept watching.  After a period of about 45 mins, the two smaller ""stars"" seemed to merge with the bigger one and with that, the big ""star"" literally shot up into the sky, at such a speed, that if we had blinked at that instant, we would have missed it.

Several months later I received a call from a Control Tower Operator in Oakland who would not tell me his name but verified what I saw was viewed on RADAR at the Center. The objects ere circular in shape and the sun reflected off the material. I and my two class mates were working in a venitian blind company just outside of town when the event occurred.  We were all in our teens. Subsequently I had observed other phenomena througout the years. My girlfriend (eventually my wife) were parked on a hill overlooking the Burbank Airport one summer night in around March of 1956.  A cirlular object floated over our heads and just sat there.  We were sitting in a convertible and just looked up and saw a huge cirlular object with several lights underneath.  It hovered there for about 20 minutes.  Planes were landing overhead above the object.  Eventually it sped off over the Burbank mountains. Soon after marriage driving from Burbank to our new home in Orange, California at about 2 am in the morning, we were tracked by a bright green ball type object that followed us over the organe groves until we reached out home. Then next day the papers were full of sightings over El Toro Marine base near by. Several years later while living in Villa Park, California (near Orange,CA.) I was awakened after midnight with what sounded like rocks on the roof. Then there was a brilliant white/blue light that came from our Patio and lit up our room.  I ran outside to the Patio and the light was not there. I looked up and saw an object in the Western sky that appeard to retract a bright light from beneath (like airplane landing lights) and up into the object.  It then sped off towards the ocean.  The next night I saw a bright light streak across the sky from North to South. Subsequently I was approached by a person outside of Reno, Nevada and had several years of education regarding UFO's. I met with Linda Moulton Howe in Oceanside, California about 5 or 6 years ago.  I related the story to her.  We communicated for a while and then lost contact.  Professor Hynek and his assistant was also in contact with me regarding this 'person'.  But when I sent a tape recording to Hynek and the audio was completely erased including the emulsion, Hynek thought it best to cut off communications with me.  That was the last time I heard from him.  The year was about 1975 when I leved in Villa Park, CA. The original tape from the interview also dissapeared from my safe.

One such morning I looked to the north and saw a light sweeping across the sky with a very slight undulating path. I pointed it out and we all speculated what it might be. (this was a bunch of pretty smart guys due to our mission) We discounted inversion reflections, F-86D with afterburners (no satellites yet!) meteors. While speculating, here comes another one! Well for three nights in a row, we saw 4 to ten in one night. Although they were comeing from different parts of the norther horizon, they seemed to vanish pretty nearly the same place on the southern. (as determined by a fiducial point, an antenna)The path, when check on a map, was straight across the libyan desert crossing the Tbilsi Mountains.I did talk to an airman at the A C & W squadron (radar) after hearing the F-86D's scramble obviously in response to these odd lights. He said, ""Oh, Yeah. We see these all the time"" and quoted a speed I can't remember but was very fast.(it was odd to scramble jets at that time of the morning unless it was for an earnest cause- the officers do like their sleep!)",,,

I am sending this because I your site I found out that there was a UFO flap in 1956.  Until today I was unaware of this.In the summer of 1956 my parents and I lived in Wyoming.  They decided to go to Yellowstone and it was there that I saw what I am telling you now.  Even though I was three I recall much about the trip because Yellowstone was such a special place.  I think my parents were probably very impressed so it stuck in my mind.  Anyway we had spent the night parked along the road, not in a camp ground or in a cabin.  My mother recalled that it had been a very spooky night, very dark.  As we left the park the next day we traveled south along a narrow highway.  We were in a black Hudson, and I was laying in the back window-well (it was my favorite place to ride on long trips).  As I looked up at the sky and trees I saw three objects coming up from behind us about 100 feet above us.  They followed behind the car staying in between the trees that lined both sides of the road.  I remember I had seen them as we were coming around a curve.  They looked like metal painted orange with yellow rib!s on their undersides.  Each was a disk about 20 feet wide and on top was a dome with a large glass or window.  In each was a human like figure.  One disk pulled away while the other two closed in on the car dropping to about 30 feet altitude.  The disk nearest the car tilted downwards at an angle so that I could see the pilot clearly.  In my three year old memories I recall thinking of the pilot in the lead craft as a HELICOPTER PILOT wearing dark sun-glasses.  My family at that time was too poor to go to movies and we did not own a TV, so the only thing I could relate the objects to were helicopters.  I waved at the pilot and he held up his left hand palm facing me and waved his hand kind of slowly back and forth.  I jumped down into the back seat and leaned over to tell my parents that there were HELICOPTERS behind us.  They looked out the windows but the objects were gone.  All I recall is that they didn't really question me about it much and dropped it.  This memory alway!s stayed with me and was never forgotten.  I didn't dwell on it but every time I saw our Yellowstone pictures or recalled the trip I also recalled the 3 crafts.  However it wasn't until I was about 10 that it suddenly dawned on me (being older and wiser) THOSE WERE NOT HELICOPTERS!  DO you know it was not until last year (1996) that it suddenly dawned on me that those guys might not have been wearing sunglasses.  Last year I did a little study and began to notice that appearances of 3 saucers with the outlines I had seen also seemed to turn up in other areas.  But there is more to my story.  neither of my parents recalled the incident (which seems normal since at the time I had told them it was helicopters and hence it wouldn't have been something to stick in their memory for several years.  Note: in about 1989 my mother called me in a panic one day to tell me a dream she'd had (my mother almost never recalled dreams and claimed she never dreamed).  She told me that she had dr!eamed that a UFO was over her house and that beings were coming into her bedroom and surrounding her.  But she said she woke up to hear a real noise over her house: it was a National Guard helicopter (there was a helicopter training base north of town: Norman Okla.).  What I wondered about was the connection of the helicopter noise to the intense UFO dream she was having.",,,

He stopped the car and got out and saw a saucer shaped object to the northwest of us. It was dark while a red light was on located on the bottom in the center. When the red light went out there was a glow coming from a circular area out from the center. This glow was greenish-blue in color. We stood next to the car for about 2-3 minutes watching the object as it was stationary directly above us. It did not wobble, there was no sound or distubance to indicate a propulsion. It then moved to the east following hammerly Road. It went over a Parking lot at Wirt rd. and Long Point Rd. where there was a carnival being held on the parking lot. It stopped over the carnival as if it was watching. We could see the lights reflecting off the bottom. It then started moving east bound following Long Point rd. We got back in the car and went home, which was about 3 miles north- west from that location. We were able to keep it in view the entire distance. We called my uncle that lived about 10 mins away and he came to our house where he and my father tried to observe the object through an eight inch telescope. They only said it looked like it had some type of windows. We last saw it following Hempstead highway to the north west After this night we rarely discused the sighting between ourselves and never with anyone else. The object was the classic saucer shape and would be about the size of a 24 inch plate held at arms length while it was above us. While it was above us and when we saw it over the carnival it appeared to be about 300 feet up. I only realized several years ago that the red light on the bottom was like a lazer light in the scanners used in stores. There could have been missing time. My father, mother, and uncle have since died of cancer. My mother had a rare form of eye cancer.

In the late summer of 1960, a group of youngsters (myself included) had finished dinner and were playing a game of hide-and-seek in the neighborhood.  I imagine there were about 8 to 10 children, mostly in the range of 5 to 10 years old.  I was 6 or 7 years old.  The sun had just set, but the sky still had a warm orange glow.  We played for some time and finally it was my chance to be ""it"", the one who counted then went to find the others in their hiding places.  I recall that I couldn't count to 50, so I counted to 10 five times.  I was leaning on a tree in the side yard of our house.  By then it was pretty dark and I felt compelled to look up.  As I did so, I observed the leading edge of a circular object emerge from over top of our house.  I was transfixed: I just stood there speechless and stared at it.  It was bigger than our house and perfectly round.  I assume it was a disc and I was observing the bottom of the craft.  It was uniformly a brilliant red-orange.  There were no external marking, windows, lights, or construction details.  Just what appeared to be a self-illuminated object.  It was perfectly silent, which added to the drama.  As soon as it dawned on me that I was seeing something extraordinary, I was filled with the strange sensation that it or they  had seen me, too.  I ran into the house to get one of my parents.  My mother was finishing up the dishes, but she came outside to see it.  It was no longer visible.  We looked in the direction of the sunset and the sky was almost the same red-orange of the craft.  This has made me wonder if the craft was reflecting the sunlight or glowing on its own.  None of the other children saw it and my mother commented that I'd seen a falling star before returning to the kitchen.  I knew I had not seen a falling star.  I was always nervous that whoever was responsible for that craft knew I saw it and might someday return.  In the years following this incident, I have had many occurences which can only best be described as psychic.  I've had lucid drea! ms and numerous sleep-walking episodes -- once even going into the front yard of my grandmother's house and staring at the eastern horizon, only to see the moon rise just at that moment.  My entire family and I observed a spherical craft while on a drive one evening in Greene County, TN.  I discovered in a casual conversation one day that two of my three brothers had also seen spherical craft during their lives - in the exact same neighborhood where we lived when I had the episode mentioned above.  We believe in the reality of the experience, but have no conclusion about the exact nature of the phenomenon.",,36.50270386100386,-82.5479583011583

Light changed to a large cicular object. During the summer of 1962, my friend and I were at the beach fishing for striped bass.  We had decided to make it an all night fishing trip.  It was a warm summer night and to the best of my knowledge no one else was on the beach.  I was sitting on a beach chair when my friend saw some- thing and yelled, ""what's that"".  I looked up and saw a round rather dull orange light approaching us directly off the ocean. My initial thought was a lost fishing boat using a rather large spotlight to find its way.  It was an odd sight but at the time seemed to be a plasible explanation.  There was a river inlet close by which fishing boats used regularly and I was used to seeing boats in the general location, al- though not that close to shore. I would say the light was 50 yards off- shore and maybe 15 feet above the water.  The width was about the same as a large floodlight, the kind you see at movie premiers, maybe a little smaller.  The light was slowly approaching directly at us and I started to become nervous as it appeared the fishing boat was going to run ashore right at our feet.  When the light reached about 25 yards to our front it suddenly commenced to rapidly accelerate.  It was still heading directly at us and I jumped from my chair, ran back a few feet, and turned back around.  I expected to see a fishing boat run up over our position and ground itself.  To my surprise the light was gone but now there was a large circular object to our front at an altitude of maybe 150 feet. The object was lit but I don't remember any details or the exact size.  It departed to the NW at a steady slow rate of speed. At the time it seemed to be an exciting adventure.  I was 17 years old and my friend 16 and wow we say something spectacular.  As I think back there is something very disturbing about the event. What happened to rapidly approaching orange light?  Why didn't we see the large circular object until after the orange light disappeared?",,,

My father said that my neighbor, ((Name deleted)), was telling him that he was upset over the fact that I literally disappeared from off my front stoop.  I stood there and looked at him.  How could I have disappeared off of my stoop??  I told him that things like that do not happen.  He said it did.  He said he was working in his yard, he saw me sitting on the stoop, he turned his head for a second, and when he looked back I was gone.   I said he must have been mistaken.  I said I must have gone into the house.  He said that there was not enough time..he said he just looked away for a second.  He was really upset about it.  I dismissed the entire thing as something he THOUGHT he saw, and forgot about it.  Who ever heard of abductions during the '60's.  We had sightings, but that was about it. Many years have passed and now the UFO information we have has grown and opened up many new avenues of thought.  One of these is abductions.  As I was first learning about this during the early '90's, I suddenly had a flashback to that conversation in the street with my dad and our neighbor. But I had no memory of any abduction..I still don't.  But what I do have is a very strange memory puzzle that fits together..and it has to do with me being on my front stoop.  When I put put these three pieces together, I came up with this strange story.  Piece one had to do with me sitting on my front stoop.  I saw a light coming from out of the north headed in my general direction. I thought it was a jet.  To think about it now why didn't I see the body of the jet..it was broad daylight on a summer afternoon. I watched the light seem to slow down and suddenly shoot off to the east.  I remember saying..wow,  a ufo. That was the first piece of memory I have had floating in my head. The second was a memory of me being on the stoop,  and suddenly I felt like absolute garbage.  I was nausious and felt a little dizzy.  I had no clue what was wrong. I tried to get up.  I figured I would go lie down on the patio lounge.  As I got up I felt worse..I was completely disoriented. I staggered towards the gate to go into my back yard and wound up in the garage standing by my bike wondering what was the matter with me.  I finally made it to the lounge, and I remember my mother telling me later that I slept for about two hours or so. IF..these pieces belong together, the picture looks like this.  I was on the stoop.  I saw the UFO coming. It slowed down.  I was grabbed and my neighbor witnessed it even though he looked away for a second.  I was returned, saw the UFO leave..and then the sick disorientation set in.  From there I walked in a disoriented state, from my stoop..to the garage..to the lounge chair and slept for hours.  I now know that this has been going on in my life since the mid '50's.  As a child I had little people in my room that would advance toward my bed...and that was all I remember. I have had visitors in my teens and adult life. I have managed to pull all of these memories that have been floating in my head for years as undefined strange events,  together to make sense of it all.  The only one I did not understand until fairly recently, was the inner nagging drive to study a particular topic. I had no idea why,  since I was 5 or so, that I had to study this topic. The information did not appear in my life until my early 20's. It continued in dribs and drabs straight to today. All of this info is on my 20 page web site. http://www.((address deleted)).HTM That's my story.",,40.781,-73.2522

Very low in the air, 500? It just hung there, sort of tilted to one side.  Many cars and people stopped and watched as this object.  All NB/SB traffic on I-5/Hwy 89, people of Dunsmuir and Mt. Shasta MUST HAVE SEEN THIS! I was a 5 or 6 year old child at the time.  We were returning to Mccloud from Mt. Shasta via Hwy 89 at the I-5 interchange.  My mother pulled over at the entrance to the Drive-In Movie theater and I saw other cars stopped and people outside of them looking up into the sky.  I remember my mother being awed, and all the others who were watching.  This cigar shaped, metallic, windowless, soundless, unlighted object was hanging, slightly tilted, in the clear blue afternoon sky.  I know this was the time frame because I remember the sun was behind us as I looked up at it.  I was not overly impressed (at that age) but I could tell the adults were.  My dad and I always watched the space shots, I remember him telling me the news said it was some type of satelite or rocket part falling from the sky.  But it never fell, or moved at all.  I remember even as a small child I knew this was not true and wondered why this explanation was given.  I do not know the duration of the event.  It was actually rather boring after you got over the shock of this strange thing in the sky.   Eventually we quit watching and drove on home.  I do not know the duration of the event but estimate it as 30 minutes +, (about that time is all we watched but it was there when we went on, still hanging.  I have always wanted to speak to others who witnessed this, especially those older than myself (I'm 39 now)  I wrote this because of seeing other, similar descriptions in other locations during 1964/65 ish.  I will send a map, by mail.  I have not looked for microfished newpaper coverage.  Many, many people had to have observed this object as it was in a very visible, high traffic area being over the interchange of Hwy 89 at I-5 on a very clear, sunny day.  The sun was not in the same part of the sky, it was in the west, behind anyone looking at the object.  It was most directly over the Drive-In Movie theater/Mott Airstrip in the triangle shaped area NE of  the Hwy 89 at I-5 junction. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,41.3181,-122.3202

I got out of my car & looked up & saw a bright,circular object in the sky.  It was stationary, and looked bigger than a full moon. I'm not sure of the exact date or time, but it was during the summer of 1965; it could have been June, July, or Aug., and it was between 21:00 and 22:00, just before dusk.  I was 19 yrs old and returning from an evening college class, when I drove through the intersection of 17'th St. & Prospect Ave. in the North Tustin/Santa Ana, Ca. area.  I noticed 5-10 cars pulled off the road, including a Calif. Highway Patrol car, and people were out of their cars (including a Ca. Hwy Patrrolman) and gazing upward, towards the south, at a brightly lit circular object that appeared as bright as a full moon, and slightly larger.  I knew it was not the Moon, however, because I could see the Moon in another part of the sky.  The object, which I would estimate was a half mile to one mile away, did not move while I watched it for several minutes.  Since I was only about a half mile from my house, I hopped in my car and drove as fast as I could to my house, because I wanted to point out the object to my Mother & Brother.  By the time I got to my house the object was no longer visible.  I never saw anything in the newspapers, or other media, about this event, and I have never seen any other anomalous objects in the sky, either before, or after this event.

Large number of police saw 3 objects within an hour of our sighting but on the other side of mountain that they disappeared over.  Interceptor aircraft attempted to engage.  See below. Sometime around this time,  (1966-1969)...It may very well have been Labor Day Weekend in Sep 1967, I was camping near Crestone, Colorado with several cousins.  It is 40 miles north of Alamosa.   We had just watched the sunset and could just see the other side of the valley to the west.  We all saw the same thing.  I saw it first.  It looked like a very large meteor was about to hit the other side of the valley.   I got everyone's attention as the object got closer.  It was a ball of fire coming down from space.  At around 30,000 feet, it split into three balls of fire.  At that point our mutual reaction was that it was a mirved missile hitting the western range of mountains surrounding the valley.   We started to take cover behind a very large boulder when the three objects made a 90 degree turn and came across the valley straight at us.  Our thoughts later were that they were intelligent and had detected us watching and decided to buzz us.   They took approximately 5 seconds to cross the 40 mile wide valley flying perfectly horizontal and in a 3 abreast formation with one slightly ahead of the one on either side.   We were at about 9000 feet on the side of the 14,000 foot Crestone Mountain range.  The three objects were trailing several thousand feet of sparks (?) and looked like they would pass just overhead and hit the mountains behind us.   We rushed to the other side of the boulder and took cover, but the three objects disappeared over the mountains peaks to the east.   We stood around in silence for a few moments and then started asking each other what we saw.   We were all recent college graduates.  I  was leaving for Air Force Officer's Training School on the 13th of September and then going to Pilot school, so it very well could have been September 1967 right before I left.  We decided that it could not have been UFO's or anything in the Human inventory, but we still were thinking (hoping) meteors.  We had all expected a huge impact explosion and minor earthquakes when they surely hit on the other side of the mountain range, but felt and saw nothing.  The three objects had made a roaring noise that had drowned out attempts to yell at each other until the silence after the passage.  The next day we went down to the Crestone trading post to buy a newspaper, but there was nothing in the paper.  We telephoned the Alamosa Sheriff's office and asked about large meteor impacts or UFO reports...nothing.   The next morning, we bought another paper and discovered that less than an hour after our sighting the Colorado Prison on the east side of the Crestone Mountains had seen three lights hovering around the prison.  The Colorado Highway Patrol and local police had chased the lights around for over two hours while the off duty guards were recalled to duty in case of a helicopter prison break.  Nearly 300 police saw the lights that night.   Finally, the Colorado Highway Patrol called Petersen AFB to check for radar images and the base reported positively and at the request of the Colorado Highway Patrol launched two F106 intercepters.  The Air Force thought they were police helicopters patroling around the prison or looking for escapees and didn't know the lights were being chased by the police for two hours.   The pilots had the images on radar shortly after takeoff and were closing fast.  The lead pilot asked for permission to fire weapons and while waiting, the radar images and the 3 lights went straight up accelerating far faster than an air to air missile could have flown.   The weapons release was never given to the pilots who had attempted to follow them until their F106's could climb no higher and the objects went out of sight straight up into space.   We all purchased copies of the newspaper to keep forever, but none of us have ever been able to find those newspapers or any other record of the incident.  One of these days after I retire and have lots of time, I would like to find the old newspaper files.  None of us have ever taken drugs or had enough alcohol to impact our judgement even though we are all over 50 now.  In fact one of the cousins does not even drink coffee because it is a stimulant.   If you have any records of the incident I would gladly pay for copies.  It would be nice to have the hard copy documentation for my own satisfaction.   I'm sure my cousins that were there would also like to have copies of their own.   I have a security clearance and still work for the US Air Force, one of the cousins is now a lawyer, and the other is an emergency inhalation therapist and ex-Green Beret.   This should be well documented because of the number of people that saw the lights near the prison and the newspaper article.((Number deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Craft hoovered about ten feet over my head, backed off, lowered to eye level, then raised and hoovered over head again. It was about 12:30am, Lake Secession, in Abbeville, SC.  This event occurred aprox. a quarter of a mile from a hydro-electric dam.   I was alone when I noticed a whirring/whining dynamo type of sound outside.  I saw an amber colored flashing light reflecting on the trees outside.  When I walked out the door, overhead I saw a flying saucer (saucer/disc about 35 feet across and about 10 feet in height) hoovering above me no more than ten feet.  There were four sets of lights (each set had three rotating amber lights) which bathed the area in amber.  The outter skin of the ship was what appeared to be a silvery/shiney metalic color.  I recall being terrorfied beyond description to the point where I could not move.  (the house I was in was one of those lake houses that was on ""stilts"" where the outside deck was about 8 feet off the ground.  Also the lake house had twelve sides and would look circular from the air)  After hoovering overhead, the craft backed away some twenty (20) feet and lowered to where it would be almost eye level with me.  This craft was a saucer shape with a smaller dome on top.  The top dome had a round porthole (window) that was opaque/translucent and I could see that there was a white, low intensity light inside.  Due to the type of opaque/translucent characteristic of the porthole...I could not see if there was anything inside; however, I ""knew"" that something was in there and it was looking at me.  The craft then raised up, came forward directly over head and hoovered.  This event lasted approximately 5 minutes; although, there are gaps in my memory as to what exactly happened.  The craft then sped off effortlessly about 200 yards and hoovered momentarily over the Lake.  Then it sped off at a 45 degree angle towards the southwest at such a speed that I could not even begin to estimate, until it vanished from my sight into space.  That evening it was a crisp, winter night and the sky was clear giving me an excellent unobstructed view of the craft and the sky as it was departing. As far as my background.  At the time, I was 17.  I'm a white male.  I currently am college educated with a degree in General Business.  I am also a Vietnam Veteran and spent about 3 years on a US Naval Destroyer and have put in many hours as lookout while at sea.  I have been trained to spot and identify various types of aircraft and missiles.  This craft was not identifiable to any aircraft in existense in the United States or any other country's millitary or civilian air force. I've always had the feeling that there was something else that happened that night.  I have a gap in my memory as to all of the events that occurred that night.  I wish that there was someone that I could talk with about this. ((ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REPORT)) Change discription of noise....I need to make a change to my earlier report that I sent in. I just entered a report last night....please change the sound that the UFO made.  I had originally typed in it made a Whirring/whining sound.  It was a whirring/whooshing noise. Also...several years later...I had bumped into a fried that I had known for a very long time and after years of not seeing him.  He asked me ""whatever happened with that UFO that you saw?""  I didn't recall telling him about that and asked him what he meant by that.  He told me that I had called him while the UFO was there...while it was over the house.  The reason that I said that I have gaps in my memory abouth this encounter was that I never recalled being on the phone with him and telling him about the UFO being there.  This more or less collaborates in a way, that this was happening.  Also....an addition to my background I have had many years experience as a radio announcer and radio news reporter.  At the time of this encounter...I had already had about 2 years experience in broadcast news gathering...so some of the details that I give are as specific as possible. I hope that you will make the changes in my original report that I sent in earlier.  Thank you.....again.  ((Name deleted))",,34.1621,-82.43330000000002

The first one slowed down made a sharp 90 degree turn very quickly to the south for about 1 or 2 seconds then made another 90 degree turn very quickly to the west. The other 2 lights chasing it did exactly the same thing. Like making the exact same movements as the first one by slowing down, speeding up and making the very sharp and quick turns.

Mr. Kwong is an engineer and lives in San Jose.  I did not get a written report from his 12-year-old son, Michael, but will send it to you if he writes one.  I believe that the reports from Mr. Kwong and myself should be thorough enough.  The only difficulty in writing our reports would be regarding the order in which we saw everything happen.  This is due to the fact that we saw up to five UFO's (four to five in the air at once).  We were not always looking at the same UFO at the same time.  Since there were several UFO's in the sky at once during our sighting, we didn't always focus on the same UFO's.  Anyway, the following is my accounting of what we saw.  Also, please note that I may have incorrectly given you the time of the sighting as being between 10:30 AM and 11:00 to 11:15.  The time was between 9:30 AM to 10:00 or later.  It was definitely for at least a half hour, maybe an hour (I began teaching my tennis lesson at 9:00 and noticed the first UFO at about 9:30.  When I arrived at home, 2 min. away, it was about 11:00 but I don't recall watching the UFO's for more than 45 min. to an hour at the very most -very minimum was a half hour). To whom it may concern: On Saturday, July 22, 1995 at 9:30 AM I, along with Michael Kwong (age 12), and his father (Ben Kwong), had a UFO's sighting which lasted for at least a half hour (to 10:15 AM or later) over the sky of Santa Clara, CA, from the Marina Playa Apt. complex tennis courts located at 3500 Granada Ave. and Lawrence Expressway (El Camino is a close cross street of Lawrence Expressway).  The sighting first began at 9:30 AM when I was teaching Michael Kwong a tennis lesson.  Michael was practicing his serve and was tossing the ball in the air.  I looked at the ball toss as it went up and noticed that the moon was out.  I also noticed an object by the moon which I took to be a star and appeared stationary like a star.  I looked at the object again and thought it might be moving slowly.  The object appeared to be moving slowly at a very high altitude, perhaps just within the atmosphere or at least at a very high altitude.  I spoke to Michael and began to say things out loud like, ""What is that?  What the heck is that?  It's not an airplane.""  Michael looked up at it as well.  I stopped the lesson out of curiosity to watch this object.  I walked over to the fence and yelled to Ben Kwong, who was sitting in his car reading the newspaper.  I asked him to come out of his car to get a look a the object so we could figure out what it was.  He stood down below the tennis courts, looking up at the object as I and Michael were too.  Then Mr. Kwong came up to the court and all three of us continued to watch the object.  The object looked completely round and whitish in appearance (perhaps due to the altitude or even entering the atmosphere?).  The object slowly moved away from the moon and then curved a slowly headed back toward its original position, and then it appeared to hover and then start to move slowly again.  We watched this object for a few minutes and then we saw another object which looked had the same appearance as the first object.  I don't remember if Mr. Kwong or I spotted the next object first (Mr. Kwong's son is near sighted, so he had a harder time seeing).  I believe we watched until finally we saw at least four of the whitish objects in the sky.  At one point it appeared like they were hovering and moving slowly in four corners of the sky.  When they were closer to us, they appeared metallic, sort of a metallic, silver to silver-blue in color.  When they were higher up they initially appeared to be more whitish in color.  Anyway, we continued watching several of these objects as they moved slowly, stop, and move in bizarre paths, unlike airplanes.  They were very high but left no exhaust trail.  They moved and changed direction, unlike weather balloons or satellites.  At some point, after watching the (I'll call them silver, or metallic-silver/blue) objects, Ben and I noticed a red UFO, completely round like the others, but a metallic-red in color.  We then both observed a silver UFO and the red UFO in a staggered formation, with the silver UFO leading in front to the left of the red UFO (doing what appeared to be the same speed).  We noticed another red object at a lower altitude slowly moving up into the sky (not metallic, but more of an all orange to orange-red in color).  I didn't, nor did Ben, take much notice of this object as it slowly went up into the sky.  It could have been a balloon and didn't have the metallic look of the other objects which were very high in the sky.  At some point, the silver UFO's would just disappear from sight.  I don't know where they went, maybe out into the upper atmosphere,  Then sometimes one would come back into view.  The red UFO really caught my attention next.  Ben had lost sight of it (you really had to ""track"" with your eyes without looking away from the UFO's or it would take a few seconds to find some of them again).  Anyway, I told Ben that I could see the red UFO again.  I saw it moving very slowly up in the sky and then it suddenly shot through the sky at an amazing speed.  I said, "" There it goes! There it goes! Look at it go!""  Ben kept saying that he couldn't find it.  We watched some of the other UFO's until it seemed that there were no more to see (they had all gone, but we didn't see them leave).  We had about given up on seeing any more UFO's up there when I caught sight of the first or perhaps another red UFO.  I told Ben to look up as I pointed to its location.  Ben said he could see it.  Suddenly the red UFO shot across the sky at an amazing speed, much much faster than any jet or rocket could fly (we were watching regular passenger jets crawl across the sky every once in awhile as we watched the UFO's.  The passenger jets, and some jets which may have been military from Moffet Field, were at a much lower altitude than the UFO's, a testimony to the speed of the UFO's).  I kept pointing at the red UFO as it sped across the sky.  We were both in awe, and were both speaking out loud in our amazement of the speed of the object (""There is no way that can be a jet.  Nothing is that fast.  Look at it go."" -etc., etc.).  As I was moving my finger across the sky, tracking the object (in what would take a jet several minutes to travel, I followed the object across the sky in less than ten seconds.  It was still at a very high altitude as well), Ben said he could see a silver UFO right next to the red one.  I said I only could see the red one, but just before the red UFO completely went out of sight, I could see another UFO, a silver one, very close to the red UFO or joined to it.  We were then completely convinced that we saw UFO's, things which are not man-made.  We didn't see any more UFO's for a few minutes, so I resumed my tennis lesson, although I had a very hard time teaching.  We stopped a few minutes later.  I looked up again and saw one lone silver UFO (up so high that it appeared white).  It was hovering and then started to move slowly again.  I told Ben and Michael that there was another one up there.  At this point, we already saw the most exciting part of our sighting (the red UFO & silver UFO shooting off).  Our necks were tired from the strain of looking up, almost straight up at times for over a half hour (possibly an hour or more, as Ben stated, although I can't be sure).  We really didn't take much notice of this UFO and we didn't see it disappear from sight, but it did a couple of minutes later.  We parted between 10:30 and 11:00 AM.  I went back to my apartment and called some TV stations to see if anyone had reported anything (I really thought SOMEONE would have witnessed what we saw and would report it.  The TV station personnel said nobody else called in, plus they seemed rather skeptical of my story.  That annoyed me a bit.  I then called the Air Force in Santa Clara County.  They switched me from command post to command post.  I gave my story up to three times perhaps.  They asked me at what time I saw the UFO's, took my story, and then said they would transfer me to another command post and to just tell them the same thing (that I told the first people I contacted).  Finally, the Air Force gave me the phone # of the National UFO Reporting Agency (for whom I am writing this report).  I, after giving my story to Peter Davenport, was made aware of the fact that another person in California reported seeing up to five UFO's on the same day I had my sighting.  This was my first time every seeing anything like this in my life (I'm 29-years-old, teach tennis and am also a computer specialist teaching elementary school.  Ben, like I said, is an engineer.  So I believe we are both credible people). End of Report I'm waiting to get my grandmother's written report of her two sightings and my mother's report of a sighting (these all happened many years ago).  I was afraid to mention their sightings because I thought it might make my sighting less credible.  I indeed immediately felt I had something to share with them and also wanted them to retell of their sightings as well.  My grandmother's sightings are of particular interest to me since she saw a UFO in the Almaden area of San Jose, CA some 58 years ago.  I teach in this area and my ancestors first settled there in the 1860's.  Someone emailed me who lives in Almaden to tell me she and her daughter & 14-year-old son had sightings in Almaden.  She said that her son saw one hovering over the school that I teach at.  This was before she even knew that I teach at this school!  Anyway, I don't know how many people you can believe on the Internet re. sightings, but I know what I saw, and that's good enough for me.  The only other strange thing I observed in my life was described to me by someone on the Internet as being ""ball lightening"" or something like it.  I was twelve-years-old at the time.  I don't know if that is UFO related or not.  Is it just a normal phenomenon.  It happened indoors.  It went under a cot.  The cot shot straight up in the air, about five feet, and there was nothing underneath the cot!  The object was indefinable in shape, just grayish/white, and swirling.  It seemed to react to me as I entered the room and skimmed across the floor.  Any ideas? Sincerely, William D.

I had a strong feeling not to discuss this sight with anyone, as interesting and astounding to me as it was. While riding home from middle school in the backseat of a Volkswagon Beetle I was gazing out the rear window of the car when I saw a silvery perfectly round object that resembled a full moon rising steadily against a gray overcast sky.  There was no rain occuring, just a dry overcast gray day.  At that time, I was thirteen years old.  I knew that what I saw was not a weather balloon, due to the fact that my father, a small aircraft pilot, had taken me numerous times to the local airport to view weather balloon launches, and I was very familiar with all that weather balloons involve, both visually and mechanically. While watching this object for about thirty seconds, I felt that I was not intended to see it, and I made what I felt was a conscious decision to never discuss what I had seen.  I noticed the object ascending from the East, and I watched it with apprehension until the vehicle in which I was riding turned a corner and went down a hill towards my home, and my view was blocked by landscape and trees..  When I first noticed the silver circle it was about 20 degrees about the visible horizon, when I lost sight of it thirty seconds later it was in what I would consider the 11:00 AM position, but not overhead, still east of me. To the east of my sighting location there was no developments, airports, cities, etc.-- just rural area. The object seemed to be very close in proximity and relatively the size of a full moon, and metallic-- silver in color.

The object was metal, flat-bottomed, with a sloped dome in the center.  An Air Force jet was in pursuit.  The metal object was at a low altitude, as if it were about to land. In 1971, when I lived in Spokane, WA, I saw a UFO.  I was finished with my shift as a Registered Nurse at Deaconess Hospital, enroute to meet my fiance.  We planned to see a movie at the Garland Theater on the north end of the city.  It was midweek, a Wednesday or Thursday, and the date may have been 6/10/71.As I drove north up the Monroe Street hill at approximately 3:50 PM (my shift ended at 3:30 PM), I had to put down the sun visor because a bright light was hitting me in the eyes.  When I reached the top of the hill, I stopped for a traffic light.  It was then that I noticed that the bright light was reflecting off a metal flying object that I can only describe as a ""flying saucer"".  The surface of the object was metal, the color of aluminum or stainless steel.  The object was round, flat on the bottom, and with a sloped dome in the center.  This ""flying saucer"" was not high in the sky, but at a low altitude, as if it were about to land.  An Air Force jet of similar size was in pursuit of the UFO at the same altitude and close behind.I thought the jet might be based at nearby Fairchild Air Force Base.When the traffic light turned green, I proceeded on my way and lost sight of the UFO.

There was absolutely no sound or movement, and it was still, clear night. I flicked on the headlights and went from low to high beam and turned them off. Within 5 seconds the object's center light went out for about 10 seconds then came back on. We'd been observing it for over 5 minutes at this point. Spooked, we got back in the car, started it and watched another full minute as the object's lights extinguished individually. We could not make out any shape(s) but were convinced beyond any doubt that what we had seen was unconventional, to say the least. I'd like to know if any similar sightings have been reported. Although this happened a long time ago it kind of haunts me and I know I'll never forget it. Have there been sightings involving 3 bright lights, especially near Lake Superior? To cap off the sighting, we returned to the Coast Guard station where I called an Air Force installation (radar, I believe) which to my recollection was north of Calumet going toward Copper Harbor. Don't know if it's still there. I told the officer on duty I was with the Coast Guard and asked if they'd picked up anything on radar in the area I described to him but he wouldn't tell me anything, either yes or no.

We walked around and underneath the craft for 15 or 20 minutes while it remained motionless and soundless above what should have been a busy, suburban street. Without apparent means the craft suddenly shot straight up into a small cloud and drifted away. We both completly forgot about this incident for 3 years. I think it is also relevant that both of us felt then and now that we are missing a 24 hour period of our lives. Please forgive me in advance if this narrative seems to ramble. Frankly I am a little trepeditious of relaying the events of that afternoon 25 years ago. I am still fearful of what I saw but I am more afraid of what I cannot remember.

I had an average childhood and an interesting adult life of travel. love affairs and advanced education. I suppose I'm just pretty damned average in every way except for this nagging experience which continues to haunt me. In either September or October of 1973 at approximately 1515 hours, my sister ((Name deleted)) (13yoa) and I (16yoa) had just been dropped off by our school bus in front of our house. We were living in a heavily populated suburban area of Mansfield Ohio in the ((Address deleted)) block of Cook Road. Cook Road itself is a busy two lane street and, although our section was mostly residential, a school and a convenience store were both within half a block from where we stood. Our house was at the base of two gradually sloping hills amidst dozens of homes on both sides of the street. I had exited the bus before my sister and stood waiting for her on the sidewalk. As she stepped from the bus and it pulled away I was startled to see a large object hovering over the street where the school bus had been. I pointed it out to my sister and we both stood captivated by it's appearance and proximity. The craft was approximatly 40 feet long and 15 or 20 feet tall. It hovered silently 35 or 40 feet overhead and had lights encircling it's cigar-shaped structure. I believe there was a larger red light on one end and a green light on the other but the rest of the smaller lights were multicolored. It was of a metal which looked like brushed aluminium and had no visible means of levitation or propulsion, no wings or propellers. I walked into the street underneath the craft and accross the street to see it from the other side. There were no numbers or letters of any kind displayed and I could not see any seams for the release of landing apparatus. At one point I picked up a rock to hear what it would sound like bounced against the exterior but my sister disuaded me from throwing it. I remember we were becomming increasingly distressed when I was not able to identify this object and by the fact we were alone. It had been at least 15 minutes since we first saw the craft and during this time, remarkably, no one had passed by. No one came out onto their front porch, no other kids walked the sidewalks and no cars drove by. In retrospect this seems absurd given the time of day and usual traffic on Cook Road. When I returned to the side of the street on which my sister stood I now saw a small black oval slightly above the row of lights. We thought it might be a window and waved but there was no response. Several minutes later the craft silently shot up and into a small cumulus cloud which drifted away. I remember my sister asking me what it was to which I replied ""I don't know. do you think it could be one of those UFO's the paper's been writing about?"" We were both excited and scared as we walked into our ho! use whereupon we both completely forgot about it. Although we had no apparant memory of the event I recall that we were both very upset with our mother whom we accused of leaving us for a 24 hour period. Mom insisted she had never done such a thing but we were convinced we had experienced a full 24 hours without her. This missing time was particularly perplexing to both of us and, to this day, remains a disturbing reality. I know that I am missing a day, but I cannot explain it. Three years after our encounter I had a sudden recall of the events described above while talking about the cosmos with some college friends. I called my sister and asked her if she had ever seen a flying saucer. At first she said no but when I mentioned the school bus in Ohio she also had a sudden realization and literally gasped on the phone. Her memory of the event is almost exactly like my own including the little window and the strange missing time. There's a lot more to tell about subsequent related occurances and some strange stories of little men I used to tell to my mother when I was very young but this is the heart of the matter. Life goes on but I sure wish I could understand the ""what's"" and the ""why""s""  of this event.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,40.74201321839081,-82.54685747126437

Flying objects sighted for many days anad then they stopped. what proof do I have. very little. But here goes the old story(real), Cannon AFB had just installed floodlight poles around the flightline, it greatly assisted maintenance on the F-111D's at night. It lit up the flilghtline nicely for us, the ones who had to work in the dark to fix these jets. About that time the sightings started. I did not get to personnaly see them, dumb me, I didn't put out the effort to go out and see them, because they sounded so common of an experience, at that time. This is the main meat of the story, short and to the (dull) point. Additional information to assist in verification of my statement. I haven't dug into my old papers to prove this date to within one week. But the base paper ""Mach Meter""  if you get an old copy carried the news about the lights being installed. next (if I remember as correct as possible) that the local news paper from Clovis New Mexico (near the Texas border, near lobbuck texas) ran a story about the UFS's seen in the night time sky. The rough year 1975-1976. My guess is that the visitors were interested in this big bright spot that reciently appeared on this planet. This is my guess. The base and town newspaper could be researched to verify the exact dates. Now to add some info that may seem to push the boundry some. Susposidely (I got from talking with others (crew chief-OMS)) that Blue section had launched a few sorties after the fly day had finished. I don't remember the quanity, about 3 to 6 jets, were launched LATE in the day/evening, or night if you wish, that is strange, ok, but another item being that at that particular time frame, blue section was the only jets that were capeable/fully functional (FMC) of firing their gun. ?? that is strange also.

My daughter, who was seven years old at the time, was outside and I hurriedly called her to come. I helped her hold the glasses and moved them around until she located the objects and her immediate comment confirmed my initial observation: ""They're tops, dad!"" she exlaimed. I watched these objects for three or four minutes until they faded from view. I would also note that shortly after I observed these objects, our pet dog--and every dog within earshot--began to howl and bark. I heard no sound whatsoever associated with the passages of these objects, although they were quite a distance away. I had the impression that they were perhaps two or three miles away at a minimum, which would have made them quite large. I should also note that I am a newspaper reporter and something of a trained observer and trained to give fairly accurate descriptions of events.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,36.1504,-88.5331

Initially while walking along Atlantic Boulevard, I noticed the vapor trail of a south bound tri-jet (L-1011 OR DC-10) north of downtown. The estimated altitude was 35-40,00 feet. I then noticed a metallic booomerang shaped object approaching from east over the Atlantic Ocean to west. Initial altitude 20-25,000 feet. With amazing speed and rate of climb, it almost collided with the tri-jet heavy, The jet swived to avoid it, and the miss was so close that the vapor trail of the jet was broken by the object.

The first and last lights were colored red, others were white.  No vertical stabilizer or wings. The object was moving south to north at about 200' AGL.  It was a long (B-52 length) tubular shaped gray object with 6 or 7 oval shaped lights about 3 times the size of a commercial plane window.  The first and last lights were red in color, the others (middle) were white.  There was no vertical stabilizer (tailfin) and no visible wings.  The sighting was planform (from the side) so it is possible there may have been wings of some kind washed out in the bloom from the lights.  It was low to the ground at about 3/4 - 1 mile moving with no visible propulsion (exhaust) and made no noise.  We noticed it as it was abeam (closest point of movement) us and watched it as it moved North over a ridge.  It was moving relatively slow (about 80 - 100 kts reflecting back with my current experience) and was in view for about 3 minutes.  The aspect of it never changed; meaning the lights were visible pointing at us.The sighting took place near a remote cow-camp near the Idaho, Oregon, Nevada border back in Aug of 1976.  It was about 4:30 pm, 3 hrs before sunset with a high (about 25000 agl) scattered layer of clouds.  The observers were myself and my brother, age 7 & 5 respectively, my father, age 50 at the time, and two Piahute Indians, one about 35yrs old and the other was 8.  The sighting was in the vicinity of IR-300 (Instrument Route) which is frequented by AF B-52's which is what we thought it was at first.  My father was a high school counselor with a masters degree and the older indian was a high school english teacher with a BA.  With the recent uprise of UFO ism in America, my father prompted me to submit this and helped me fill in the gaps of my young memory, which is still quite vivid.  I myself am now a carrier pilot in the Navy and have exhausted any skepticism that I had growing up of what I actually saw.  Much of which came from the two Piahute Indians I was with who ar!e extremely superstitious and would not talk about the sighting, nor acknowledge what it was at the time.  My younger brother, now 25 has a slight memory of the sighting as well.Sorry this is so long coming.  Just got internet.  Can draw picture if interested.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,,

As we were coming up on a plateau where a silo, cow barn and cow field are located, we saw a light hovering above the cow pasture.  We saw this light at 1/4 miles from plateau.  My brother and I watched the light as we approached the plateau, not saying anything. Almost like we were in shock, I mentioned ""What was this?"" He acknowledged the same.  We sped up and started approaching the hill to the plateau. As we came to approximately 100 yards, the object started to move. It had been hovering approx. 75-100 yards above the cow pasture. The object was round and orange-yellow in color. It was maybe 5-6 feet around. There was no sound.  It took off and sped toward the ridge.  I sped the auto to app. 85 mph to catch up.  I was flashing the lights of the auto and blowing the horn.  Personally, I felt as if our metallic presence of the auto was making the object move.  It moved as we made our closest point of approach.  Unusually, the object stopped at the ridge.  It could have been our perception, but it appeared to stop before going out of sight.  I had stopped the car and got out and yelled at it.  I told my brother that if it were extra-terrestial, then I wanted to meet them. My brother and I travel down into the valley to cross another ridge. I had presumed that if it did land, then it was on top of the hill. We went down into the valley and lost sight of the object. My brother became terrified to go up on the hill to look for it.  As we looked for something, I had felt that something was there and maybe it had landed. My brother did not want me to get out of the car.  I did and I felt a strange sensation believing that there was something outside, possibly that this object had landed. This was many years ago in the 70's in approx. 1977 or 78.  I would have cast off this sighting as something not worth mentioning but my brother had another sighting of the round object recently.

Portholes, red light, ion-blue glow on bottom. Craft accellerated into beam of rainbow colored light after interceptor jets from Olmstead Airbase gave chase. On our way home from work, we passed under PA turnpike on Middletown Rd heading south. I saw a red light on an object in sky on left (east) side approx 15 degrees elevation. I am a private pilot, so I knew the object was not a plane or helicopter. To get a better view, thinking it might be a saucer, I pulled the car over and shut off the engine and lights. I rolled down the window and observed a saucer shaped craft. Once I knew what it was, I got out of the car to get better view of object. The saucer hovered motionless above the trees and over the Swatara Creek. The saucer had cupola on top. There were portholes emitting a bright yellowish glow that bathed the top of the saucer. The bottom of saucer had an ion-blue glow.  I observed solid red light (no other lights) on top - very bright, casting a red glow over top of cupola. I looked for silhouettes in windows but observed none. Craft was as big as thumb held at arms length, maybe 1/2 mile distant.  Est size of the saucer was 30' in dia. Sky was overcast. Clg was 1500' or more. Visibility was two miles or better.  Temperature was approximately 55 degrees.  I remember it was damp.  The sun had set and the sky was almost dark. The saucer was positioned 1/4 mile from my residence. I was a little scared but elated, too, because I knew that this was a really rare event.  I wondered what would happen if I waved.  Would it move?  So, I mustered my courage and waved at the saucer and sent a mental message out, ""Peace be with you!"" but there was no response. My wife said she was too cold and told me to shut car door.  I asked her if she would get out and look at the saucer. She didn't believe me and said it was just a helicopter. While we argued about that, I heard a roar of jet engines/afterburners from Olmstead AFB across the Susquehana River. When I heard the sound, I saw the saucer dart from my 10 o'clock to 11 o'clock instantly. There was a yellow flicker in the sky from the west as the jets got closer. After two seconds, the saucer darted back to the same position it was in before, only 250' higher. I thought, is it trying to triangulate the position of the jets or get out of their radar beam? Then, the flickering in the clouds and the afterburner noise got very loud. The west side of my sky started to turn yellow, they were so close above the town of Middletown. The saucer had had enough. It shot up at a 70 deg. angle instantly, leaving a rainbow colored trail behind as it went up through the sky.  The jet's never descended below the clouds, but turned upwards to chase futily after the saucer.  In a minute, the light and sound had faded. I stood for a few minutes, waiting to see if they would return, but they didn't. I got back in the car with my wife and drove home.  I decided not to report this incident because I knew that the military was involved in a cover-up and feared reprisal and did not want my life interfered with at that time by the government. Years later, I saw the pictures that George Adamski took of his saucer. That was the same saucer I saw. How could what he saw be a fake if what I saw was as real as the car I was driving home in? The chasing of the craft by the AF jets validated my experience for me.  There were no reports in the local papers anytime thereafter. It would be interesting to try to use FOI Act to obtain information from any records kept by the AF from Olmstead AFB during that time period to see if there were any evening chases of an 'unknown.'  I do not, unfortunately, remember the exact date of the event, except that it was a week-day because we were coming home from work. The location of the sighting was a few miles from Three Mile Island.  The famous TMI reactor meltdown occurred there the following year.  Was this a coincidence? I think not. In the last 22 years, I have not seen another UFO. Feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,40.1813,-76.6917

I was stuck at Usal Beach (on the road going out to US Hwy 1) after finally getting unstuck and traveling to Hwy, 1 I went South and at the top of the hill just before going down to the ocean I stopped to have a ciggarette and let my friend behind me catch up. When he did catch up he got into the cab of my truck and we talked a bit trying to decide where we would camp for the night.  We decided on Union Landing, about 2 miles above Westport on Hwy 1.  While setting there alongside the road I noticed a blue light like electric arc welding flashes in the trees ahead.  I thought another fisherman was up late working on his boat.  Upon finishing my smoke we pulled out onto the road and started down towards the beach and union landing.  When I came to a point abreast of where the lights were I looked over to see what kind of a boat etc. the supposed fisherman was working on.  There was no boat, no house, garage or anything else.  The terrain dropped off steeply and I had a view of the ocean.  I was up about 800 feet above the ocean and looking out at one hell of a sight:  3 large ufo's, each big enough to put the Kibby Dome in (the Kibby Dome is a Football Stadium at The University of Idaho at Moscow, Idaho) as I said there were 3 of them they were the shape of a childs top or a beet.  They were staggered one in front of me another further out and to the right and the third to the left of the first two and further out still.  From my position on the Highway the first was a mile from me the second aboutthree miles out and the fourth about five miles out from me.  I saw two or three white light saucers to the left of the first big ship.  The second ship had none or maybe one about it but the third big ship had about thirty saucers around it.  The big ships were outlined with pink lights and the saucers were solid white light colored.  What was happening as far as I could determine was that the saucers were taking turns going into the bigger craft, one would come out and another from outside would go in.  I watc! hed this for about 15 minutes, all the time trying to describe to myself what they looked like and what it was they were doing.  Finally I got into my truck and went the 5 or so miles to the ocean(the road wound down to the place where it followed the contour of the ocean).  Upon arriving at the ocean I could not see the UFO'S at all.  They had left.  I then continued on down Hwy. 1 to Union Landing where I made camp and stayed for 30 days.  The next morrning we saw 1 or2 F-4 Phantoms flying at about 100 feet elevation and going up the coast.  They were very close to the coast, 1/4 to 1/2 mile.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,,

As it began moving, I jumped out of bed and ran to the window watching as it rose above the tree level and house level.

I was eleven years old.  Standing on my driveway in the rustic Los Gatos Foothills with my younger brother (9 at the time) and neighbor (16 at the time).  We were talking... then both of their mouths fell open.  I turned to see what was going on.  A large elipsoidal object (about the size of a 1/4 mile running track oval was hovering toward us (very slowly) just above the sycamore trees (approx. 150 feet).  We all stood in silence and awe for a minute as the object moved almost directly over head. I ran into my house to get a camera.  Here's where it gets weird... .  I asked my mother for a camera (we had two olk kodak's in a drawer) and she forgot where they were (my mother knows exactly where everything is in her house, she's meticulous like that)  I went to the drawer where the cameras were and pulled one out.  My mother stopped me saying she didn't know if it had film in it.  I thought it did and took it and ran through the house to go outside.  (It gets weirder now)  I ran through the television room where my father was watching a rerun of Gilligan's Island (he never watches the show, doesn't like it much, BUT it was MY FAVORITE SHOW)  I had the thought that the object/UFO was now gone and sat down to watch the show (which I had seen many times before).  When the show ended... I saw that I had a camera in my hand and couldn't figure out why.  I thought hard and knew that there was something ""really important"" that I was forgetting.  I remembered the UFO and a wave of terror came over me.  I ran outside to see if it was still there. I found my younger brother and neighbor exactly where I had left them.  Only now they had been joined by two other neighborhood kids (I believe 18 and 19 years old at that time).  The UFO was no longer there.  I asked where it went.  They asked ""where did what go?""  I said, ""The UFO, where did it go?"".  They said ""oh, that, it took off real fast, but that was a while ago"" (all four of them saw it leave). I find it odd that they shrugged it off as if it was no big deal. A few years later I was with my mother in a local shopping mall.  I went into a bookstore to find her.  The book ""Communion"" had just come out and wsa displayed in the store.  I literally was scared for my life when I saw the cover... I was terrified that the alien on the cover was going to kill me.  Now, I'd never seen a picture of a Grey up to that point in my life.  And I had no idea that it was an alien.  Non-the-less, I ran out of the bookstore and sat outside for 1/2 an hour scared to go back in and see the image of the alien. Was I abducted?  I don't know. All I know is I saw that UFO (or at least something without wings or propellers)  when I was a kid.

We saw a disk-shaped object come quite close to us. It was noiseless and hovered off to my left (I was on the passenger side of the car). At one point it started to descend and that is when the shape became apparent. It had a row of very bright white lights that revolved (or the ship did, this was unclear) which it turned on an off a few times. There was a (either blue or green, I believe green) stationary light on the top which stayed on at all times. After descending it went back to approximately its original position.This viewing lasted around 15-20 minutes. Then the craft moved off to the south very fast and stopped. I could only see the lights at this point. An air force jet came from west toward the craft and turned and went back. Then a jet came from the east and did the same. The two more jets came from other sides, one at a time, and turned away. Then a jet came from the west side again only it came closer to the craft than the others had. Immediately the craft moved incredibly fast to the east side of Phoenix. The jet followed, at a slower speed. Then the craft turned to the south slowly with the jet in pursuit. At this point all the white lights on the craft went out. Immediately the lights on the jet went out. They moved to the south . I could only see the blinking of the light on the top of the craft. When they got to south Phoenix the craft was no longer visible to me. I believe the jets lost it also. For the remainder of the movie (which was around 2 hours long the jets combed the south area. The sky was clear. The weather nice. I am bad with measurements but I believe the craft was about two blocks away and approximately 100 feet in diameter. The craft could hover, move incredibly fast, was noiseless, revolved (I believe), and the white lights were very bright. I am unsure of the color of the object as the lights were very bright but it also didn't seem to have a color as such. My friend saw it and was afraid it was going to land and didn't watch much of it. At one point I got out of the car to not only get a better look but hoped to attract attention to it. I mentioned to a couple in the next car but they did not seem interested. There were no reports in the paper or news. I did hear of a man (through friends) who saw it also across town but did not know him or get a name. I was 19 years old at the time and did not know the correct way to report this. Also my memory has faded to exact date and color of light on top of craft. But the rest is quite clear. I remember the movie name and hoped to check the running dates for the movie but I am sure the drive-in is closed by now. I am interested in finding more information about this sighting, if possible. I cannot be contacted collect by phone, as I do not have long distance service but would appreciate any info on this.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

We pulled over along with some other people to watch. A friend and I had left work in the valley to run up to the northside to pick something up and bring it back to our work. It was getting close to closing time so it was probably around 10:30pm when we were headed south on the old Argonne highway. I was driving and I happened to look out my window. I spotted what looked like headlights  shining thru the trees on top of a mountain. I said to my friend, ""look at that car on the mountain"". I then realized that it couldn't be a car because if a car was up there we wouldn't have been able to see it's headlights.Then we quickly noticed that it was moving in the sky heading our way. We saw a couple of cars pulled off the road ahead and people were standing outside watching so we pulled over too. We were shivering by then, excited and scared at the same time cause we couldn't figure out what it was. The only thing I really remember is the lights. It had a center light big and round and two smaller lights one on each side of the middle light. They were bright white lights. It came right towards us moving very very slow and I heard a very very faint hum. It seemed so close, like if I craweled to the top of a tree I could have reached out and touched the bottom. I don't really remember seeing the actual craft, but in my mind I know it was like a round disk not flat but maybe with a slighly rounded belly to it, but the lights were so bright you couldn't see it anyway. It passed over us and continued on and we all stood there dumbfounded our hearts racing until we couldn't see it over the treetops anymore. All of us that were standing there just looked at each other and said wow, what was that. My friend and I got into the car and headed back to work, we had the creeps the rest of the night. I had no knowledge of any aircraft that could fly so low, quiet and slow. Before this incident I saw the same type craft when I slept over at a different friends house one summer. It must have been the summer of 77, I was fifteen at the time. We were in our sleeping bags in the backyard. It was late maybe 11:00 pm. We were laying there talking and staring at the stars. There were alot of trees in her neighborhood and in her yard. Anyway we were just laying there looking up at the beautiful stars and then we saw this craft pass over us so slow, virtually no sound and the same lights as I described before. We were so scared, we waited for it to pass over before we lept up and raced into the house screaming and freaking out. We jumped into her bed and pulled the covers over our heads. This one was also flying very low, seemed like treetop level. Too close for comfort! Of course we told everyone but no one believed us. I am now 36 years old and have not seen anything like this since, although I would like to. My grandmother lives in Newman Lake , Wa and she has watched crafts play what she calls war games over her house. I wish I could have been there to see that! Don't know how often it has happened but I know she's observed them several times. I think she said these were colorful lights and they would zoom through the sky doing quick turns and racing back in the opposite direction. This wasn't just a brief display, these war games lasted maybe 45 minutes or so.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,47.68357629392971,-117.38633105431309

It was shaped like a (vitamin capsule) not really cigar shape more full. The object rose over a hill where I was looking for elk and sat just above the horizon for about 10 mins then kind of faded away. The object was huge maybe 300 feet long and 100 feet high. I was looking from the north but the object was a shiny as if it was in full sun. It rose very slowly almost as if a cloud. I'm curious if objects like this have been seen before all I seem to hear about are discs and lights. This was real! As I said above I was elk hunting in the late fall of 1978 about 4 miles south of Virginia City, Montana. It must have been about 1600 or 1630. I was sitting on a south facing slope looking across a small valley perhaps 500 yards across. I was scanning the sparce timber just below the horizon when a huge (vitamin capsule shaped) object perhaps 300 feet long and 100 feet high, it may have been larger but those proportions are pretty close, and I'm sure it wasn't smaller. The object was more shiny than metal it looked like mylar, or a mirror, in reflectance but seemed hard surfaced. The side I was looking at was facing north with the sun behind and to the right of it, but not visible, yet the object was as shiny as if it were in full sunlight. It was the brightest thing in the sky, much more intense than the sky. It seemed to rise very slowly and as it was doing so didn't alarm me, it was as if I were a child watching a cloud rise over a hill. As it rose up from behind the hill slowly it rose to a point maybe 100 feet above the horizon then gradually decended until part of it was below the horizon meaning it was on the north side of the ridge I was looking at giving me a sense of the scale against the hillside. I had no emotional reaction just ho hum which when looking back seems really strange. Anyway I sat there and watched the object for what must have been 10 minutes and honestly I don't remember how it disappeared. I just remember thinking that I had better leave to get back to the car before dark because I still had a ways to drive on an unimproved road before getting home.  That is another strange thing I then remember being about 200 yards from the sighting place causually walking down the trail totally unconcerned, not looking over my shoulder to see if it re-appeared or anything. When I got home I don't even think I told my wife which really puzzles me in retrospect. Normally we talked about everything.

I do not think that this 'sighting', if that is what it can be called, will be of any use to you because it happened so long ago.  But I came across your website and thought, what the heck, why not record it here anyway.   It happened when I was a child (I have estimated Summer of '79) and sleeping out on the beach in front of our summer beach house with a friend of the same age.  (This was in an era when it was considered safe to let children do that).  I was woken up by something, probably in the early hours of the morning when it was still dark.  I got up and stood on the beach and saw a round object with multiple, multi-colored flashing lights either on the water or hovering just slightly above it.  The object was approximately 20-40 ft. from the shore, and there was a sound associated with it; like a white noise, but at a low, soft pitch.  At the time I thought the object was a submarine.  Now that I know what submarines look like, and that they cannot come that clo!se to shore, I know that it definitely was not.  Also at the time I was certain that it was not a boat - having grown up around boats and spending every summer on that beach, I was familiar with the shapes and appearances of boats.  Well....that is all I remember!  Feel free to contact me with any questions.  I am not making this up; the object that I saw could have been a perfectly legitimate 'vehicle' of some kind, or I could have a faulty memory.  Anyway, good luck with your research.  FYI:  I am 27, female, married w/ one small child.  I work part-time for a Seattle non-profit.  I'm not particularly into UFO's or other unexplained phenomena, in fact I could be called a skeptic.  But I am interested, and I am convinced that I saw this object back in the summer of '79 when I was 9 years old.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,,

In the winter of 1980 my older brother and I were camping out at a hunting lease in East TX, located South of Sam Rayburn Lake.  It was late in the night and the sky was clear and moonless.  We where parked in a jeep cherokee near the edge of a high power line clearing.  The area is far away from any cities and is very forested. My brother and I were talking and listining to the radio.  We both noticed two low, slow moving lights about two miles away.  The lights where visible in the distance because we were looking down (parallel) the high power line.  After obseving the lights for a couple of minites we both ask each other if the other had noticed the lights. They were moving parallel with the power line and would soon be very near to us.  At one time a beam of light shinning towards the ground came from one craft.  We both became very frightend and I cranked up the jeep and drove hastily out of the treeless area and parked about 50 feet in the woods.  We both grabbed our guns.  I had never been so scared.  I was shaking.  I turned off the engine and rolled the window down.  Looking straight up I saw one of the craft had moved straight above us.  It was about 60 feet above the tree tops.  The bottom of the craft looked very different. I recall a triangular pattern of amber lights with some long neon tube type lights also. The craft hovered above us for a few minutes. It made a continuos shhhhh sound. I thought we were about to be ether dead. But the craft moved slowly away keeping the same altitude. Fear left us as we figured, if the craft wanted to harm us it would have when it was above us. Our mood changed from complete fear to courisity. We put down our guns and ran into the opening under the high power lines for a better view. We noticed one craft had stayed back in stationary flight position while the other craft made a circular horizontal flight pattern which had taken it over the jeep and near the club house where the only other people where for a 10 to 15 mile radius. The roving craft returned near the stationary one and both hovered for a few minites. They both looked like to very bright spherical lights aganst a very star filled night sky.No blinking lights where seen. Then as we looked on hoping they would take us for a ride, they both shot silently into the upper atmoshere like a shooting star in reverse. This event blew our minds. We did not tell anybody for a couple of years. I was 16 years old at the time and my brother was in his mid 20's. He was a private pilot at the time. He knew the craft where way below stall speed for a conventional non helicopter type of flying craft. I think they used some type of EMF propulsion system.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,,

Then, I found myself in front of a screen of sorts, with a female alien next to me. On the screen, were objects and symbols that were flying by. I asked her ""why are you showing me this, I dont know what it means"" She said ""you will need it later"" I asked her is there going to be nuclear war, and she said ""no, we will prevent it"" Remember, this is 1981. And I saw myself watching  medical procedures...they were taking people from campsites and impregnating women, and mixing the husbands sperm with theirs...creating pregnancies. I  left her a year later and have not seen a UFO since....that was 1982. whatever they wanted  with me,, they must have accomplished. I have kept this a secret beyond my family fo 15 yeas I have other experiences, but I am so afraid that this is a govt site....I am a well paid medical professional, with a family and a nice house. This is the first time I have made my experience known beyond my family since  the 80's....Even my family doesn't believe me except one  brother who has had similar experiences.

I watched as it seemedto climb parralel to a radio tower (the tower is a 1/2 mile away,the object was further) for about 3-5 minutes.Then with no warning it seemed to pulse brighter,as it reached the top of a tower i was using as a guide/landmark. but it didnt disappear,it appeared to intenseify if you will....it started giving off what looked like miniature sized objects of itself,i watched as about 6-8 of these objects came off and flew off in different directions.After the objects left the Larger shape (which i believe to be a mothership of somekind) decreased its firey glow ,then moved straight about what looked to me 100' then took off toward the north at great speed. This was the 1st of 2 sightings like this i saw in that week. As i stated in the earlier summary this was only the first sighting of 2 i would see in that week.I will tell about the 2nd here.As usual i had taken the dog out about 1700-1800hrs. I noticed that the object i had seen a few days earlier was back. It was sitting adjacent to the towers again in almost the same exact location as it was previous.The Object appeared to be very large but distant.It kinda reminded me of a small sun or moon glowing a yellowish glow. After watching this it again pulsed really bright,but this time it didnt dispatch the smaller objects it was recalling them. I watched as 6-8 small objects exact duplicates of the larger one but smaller return to the larger object.after they had returned which took about 5-6 minutes i realized my parents were inside i hollered for them to come see the object i saw earlire in the week as i had told them of the previous sighting. After they had come on the porch the object again took off to the north at great speed.If memory serves this was a time when several objects had been seen in our area and sevral were reported to our local Air Force Base which has now closed.I have never seen this event again since.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,31.29095,-92.3914725

It was lighted with multiple colors on its bottom, remeniscent but not identical to the movie close enounters of the third kind. There was no energy phenomenon surrounding it as in that movie. I saw no occupants, and it was gone after a brief time. As it went behind the tower closer to the ocean, I walked down Ohua Avenue crossing this street wishing to see if it were still there behind the building. Going across Kuhio Avenue, I looked but saw nothing. If I had a camera that could have photographed what I saw, I believe it would be the most convincing UFO photograph on record. Since early April 1983 I have been aware by direct experience that we are not alone. On an early evening walk in Waikiki, Honolulu Hawaii, I witnessed a brief encounter with a UFO that appeared quite jeweled. Its multi colored lights and freedom from any sound whatsoever is entered into my own life of perceptions. It appeared right between the twin Banyan Towers on Ohua Avenue, on my left hand side while I walked towards the ocean. Hundreds of people must have had an opportunity to witness this sighting, if anyone looked out their windows. I am hopeful someone will reconfirm my sighting.. I walked ahead after it flew past that tower, and I crossed the street to go around and look for it. It was gone. It was the most vivid impression I have ever had, and the only time in my life I have witnessed the wonder of this apparently extraterrestrial technology. Once you have actually witnessed the phenomenon, you simply cannot believe every debunking of it by the conventional media. If anyone was staying at the Banyan Twin Towers on Ohua Avenue at Kuhio Avenue in April of 1983 please let me know if you also had a sighting. P.S. This is only one experience. It is a wide universe, and the possibilities are open. I also have a notion that some civilizations have progressed socially and even morally along with their gadgets to be emminently proto human. At the same time I note that a great deal of anti-social conduct demonstrates the gravity of science at times outweighing the relationship of any and all sentient beings to one another. Philosophically this is the greatest weakness of social strucutures that may tend to abandon notions of consanguinity inherent to a vital existence. I feel deeply sorry for UFO occupants who exist with such a poverty of social understanding, and even moreso that with all their technology that they are worse than primates in our worst apparent understandings of the term. At the same time I have an intuition that those occupants in my sighting may have been socially adept, even a moral set of civilization.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,,

Hard to believe still, but I was 13 reading a book on UFO's and prayed to God to see one for myself.  Within 3-5 minutes I heard a sound out the open window toward the road that sounded like a cross between a semi-truck idling and a tank.  After about 15 seconds and seeing nothing go by on the dirt road the sound stopped as abruptly as it had started.  I then suddenly saw the upper half (the lower half was hidden by bushes between me and the driveway) of a disc-shaped craft silently glide by, it's surface reflecting in the light from the carport.  I saw no lights as it passed by quickly, but there were no windows at all like there would have been if it were a car, and it was made out of what looked like ""brushed aluminum"". I watched to see if it would come back around the bend of the U-shaped driveway, but it didn't.  It didn't back up because my eyes were glued (and heart nearly pumping out of my chest) to the driveway from where I was sitting at the dining room table.  It couldn't go straight because it would've crashed into the carport.  It couldn't have gone left because of the orange grove and the porch.  It DIDN'T go right because I would've seen it come around the driveway.  I went out after about 5-15 minutes (I lost track of time then because I was so nervous and was trying to convince myself I was hallucinating... after all, I was wondering why God had answered my prayer so quickly!).  But I just kept saying to myself, ""But I know that I know I saw what I saw and I heard what I heard!"". I checked it all out and looked for marks on the ground in the one place that was my ""blind spot""; the place after where I saw it pass the window, but BEFORE where it would've hit the carport if it had continued to go straight.  Looking around and seeing only trees with their giant branches overhanging the driveway, and porches, and carports, I stood in the ""blind spot"" and discovered that the only way out from that spot was UP!  A break in the tree branches was just large enough to allow a car-sized (or disc-sized) object to go through.  There were no other options period!  Then I knew it was the real thing.

Crossed boulevard and disappeared over warehouse. drove under it thinking it a police helicopter dowing surveilance.  Very disturbing and panicked when eyes met driver of on coming traffic who witnessed same. Ok, so it bothers you're web site doesn't make any mention of this because it was in the local paper the following day as having been witnessed by a cop patroling Milwaukee Street.  Anyway as for my experience I was coming home from the Univ of Wisc Madison's library and it was late and very cold out.  I pull up to the light going northbound on Johnson Street (just past Tenney park near the police repair shop and old paint warehouses) and about 15 feet above the roof of this house down Johnson Street on my right is this thing.  It was black, but appeared illuminated - kinda dim like - underneath.  I didn't think much about it. Thought it was probably a police helicopter searching the neighborhood for some East High School punks.  But it kept my attention cause it wasn't really a spot light eminanting shining down into backyards.  Also it didn't have any blinking helicopter like lights on top.  What ever it was doing it was moving slow, steady and smooth and kept following over the row of roofs.  From what I could see it look like a rounded off van with a fat base.  My light changed and I started on my way about the same time the ""helicopter"" finished with the roofs and was headed across the street.  Alot of observations started coming real fast as I approached to go under it.  It was about 15 feet off the ground.  It was uniform in its black color but had definite seams. No windows. The one distinct feature I remember the most was a cross like seam (real pronounced like) on its belly.  This is about when all the contradictions started pooring in.  First off, there was loose snow - if it was a helicopter how come it wasn't kicking up snow?  And the bushes in the boulevard - they didn't twitch like they were caught in any chopper wash either.  I remember shutting the heater off and coasting without the gas peddle down so I could hear the helicopter.  Helicopters are noisy but none of the houses had woken up, and I wasn't hearing anything and I was right underneath it. And I felt kinda funny passing underne! ath it.  The car reacted like it was mildly buffeted by helicopter wash and I can recall kinda of a slow down.  And something was wrong about the illumination it was casting down. The light was dim but clear and the shrub branches kind of reflected like hotdogs under a heat lamp at the gas station.  So I realize now somethings fundamentally wrong.  I take my foot of the gas and this thing rises slowly to pass over the warehouse just beyond the oncoming lane's traffic.  I'm borderline freaking out and so this guy in this big vanilla colored older model chevy (the kind that seats about twenty) is coming at me in the oncoming traffic lane and he's got his face like smashed up against the windshield over his steering wheel looking real hard at what ever the thing was.  And he gives me this blank big eyed look.  After that I this wasn't right and went  right into an adreniline pump that kept me pacing when I got home for at least a half an hour.  The next day it was the newspaper being reported as mussing around on the far east side.  I really try not to talk about this.  And if I'm not sure I think I entered this same experience into this web site before - it feels good to say something.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,43.066514168714164,-89.38736175266175

Enter E-W slow bright. Outside stared obj <5m. Time on clock, >1h. Hypn 5 yr later. Abduct, exam, unsettling. I was sole percipient, had insomnia one night, sat inside bedroom gazing at night sky approximately 0100 on 041584.  Saw a blazing white light enter field of vision from east, moving to west.  A dead pine tree served as a reference point.  Object halted behind the tree.  The motion of falling leaf was observed briefly.  Object stayed in sky throughout sighting.  Feeling some compulsion to go outside, I watched it from the back yard for what I thought was only a few minutes.  The weather was cool and I was not fully clothed, so felt cold.  I noticed the object seeming to drift slightly westward, still looking like bright blazing star.  Suddenly it moved about 90 degrees to the west, without transiting.  Tired, cold, I went in, sleepy finally, and went to bed.  Told someone the next day at work about it, got laughed at and forgot it for three years.  The book Communion was published, the cover startling me and triggering a memory of that night.  For two more years I thought about it often, reading Communion and some other things on UFOs.  In 1989 I had a hypnotic regression to the night in question, remembering in detail being taken up through the air to the object, taken aboard, examined, having communication with the occupants, including some joking and prophecy.  The object appeared to have a considerable amount of detail on both the outside and inside.  The occupants were short, gray-brown in color, and wearing red suits with black trim and some sort of smooth, tight-fitting head gear that seemed to cover a part ot their faces. They stood away from the table I was placed on, behind a half-wall.  A scanning device examined me.  I got a very good look at it such that I can see it as I write this.  There were several instances of the occupants joking with me to relax me and quell my fear.  There was an instance of forced physical paralysis with total loss of muscle control.  I kept my eyes closed during much of the experience.  At the end, two of them floated me back to the yard between them.  I was unable to look closely at them out of fear, and had a screen memory of their appearance.  The content was bizarre, odd, and frightening.  I left the hypnotherapy session very upset.  For several years subsequently I had a hard time with the memory.  The session was taped.  I transcribed the tape and studied it carefully.  There was an internal coherency but the content was very unusual.  Later, I read that the things that the occupants discussed (telepathically) were not so unusual in abductions.  I saw another clinician, a published author and psychiatrist who studies paranormal events.  Two more abductions were uncovered, going back to childhood.  Another emerged spontaneously.  One of them explained a mysterious short term leg paralysis that I had as a child.  Many pieces fell into place about bad memories from childhood, fear of windows at night, always looking into the night sky, and three previous sightings I had had.  Of those, one was multiple witnessed by parents and their friends.  No subsequent UFO activit! y occurred to me.  My sense of the occupants was that they were insincere, though trying to appear to be genuine and helpful.  I did not like what happened, feeling violated.  I was 36 years old at the time of the last event.  The others occured at 12, 8 and 4 years of age.  I am a trained, State licensed psychotherapist and a trained, State certified hypnotherapist, practicing now for thirty years.  I do not, nor have I ever, talked about the UFO encounters or my interest in them, nor is there any visual cue in my office that would tip off a patient that I would be amenable to a discussion of same.  Since the event and the hypnotic regression, a patient came to me who subsequently requested hypnotherapy and was surprised to reveal a tremendous amount of encounters going back to her age of four years.  Multiple family members were also involved, three of whom (two sisters and mother)I was able to interview and study hypnotically.  The mother had a conscious waking memory of her experience, which happened also when the daughter was four.  A sister only could remember the screen memory of a wolf's face at the window.  Another sister remembered from childhood a screen memory of white horses with large, black, glassy eyes staring at her inside her bedroom, then chasing her across the house.  These sessions went on with this patient for over one year, often meeting three times a week for two to three hour hypnotherapy sessions.  Finally, I had to steer it to a close, as I had become drained and emotionally upset by it.  The woman's children were also being abducted, all of whom I saw in the office and who talked about their experiences.  This experience, of treating this patient who was such an active percipient, was exhausting personally, although did serve to relieve the patient of significant disabling symptoms.  My sense of the occupants of her objects was that they were not benevolent.  Such was also the impression held by the patient.  I will be happy to send the transcript of my experience with any other material requested by mail.  No phone calls or email, please.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,26.600205714285714,-80.12513920634922

Prior to the event I had said to myself that I travel this section of road when going to work but this was a different time of day.

In August of 1985 while my family vacationed for a week in South Nags Head, NC, a friend of mine and I watched a triangular-shaped craft above us at the beach one night.   Although I do not recall precisely what week we were there, this incident took place on a Friday night.  I and my friend, both females aged 14 at the time, customarily strolled along the shoreline in the evenings.  I estimate that our ""sighting"" occurred around 8 p.m., but that time is not absolute.  I recall that night as very dark, both starless and moonless.  However, it is possible that the fear I felt after we encountered the craft skewed my impressions of the environment; to be certain of the moon phase, I'd have to check a calendar from back then.  I do remember absolutely that the evening began clear and temperate, with just a few stringy clouds hanging here and there over the ocean.  I was looking down, trying to avoid stepping with my bare feet on the sand crabs that come out at night.  So it was my friend who first saw something odd in the sky. ""Do you see those lights?"" she asked me.  I followed her gaze, then, and I saw five lights in a tight triangular formation...the center light was red, and it was the largest.  It was flanked on either side by two smaller white lights.  I do not remember any of the lights flashing; they all maintained a kind of focused dull sheen, if that makes sense.  They did not emit beams or illuminate the sky around them.  Together, they formed what we later interpreted as the ""nose"" of the craft, although we did not at first notice any other lights or even an outline of the craft's shape because the night was so very dark.  I am guesstimating the craft's distance from us as about 50-100 feet -- very close -- and about the same distance up in the air from the ocean, but the darkness and the lack of earthbound objects (i.e. trees) by which to judge height/size made it difficult to pinpoint how large or how close this object was. As I looked up, I caught this ""nose"" emerging seemingly out of nowhere.  In retrospect, I believe that I decided on-the-spot that the craft must have been behind cloud cover because that was the only way I could rationalize its sudden appearance.  But as I said above, what few clouds there were that night were unsubstantial and spaced far apart from one another.  As farfetched as it seems, I have to consider that the craft may actually have been ""cloaked"" in some fashion and then it revealed itself...?  I feel ridiculous writing that, but I have no other explanation.  It's possible that my friend and I just happened not to see it until it was dead even with where we stood.  But the enormity of the craft and its apparent proximity to us makes that possibility seem unlikely to me. Regardless of how the lights got there, from the moment my friend and I first noticed them, some inexplicable quality they seemed to give off made us both vaguely uneasy.  I think that strangeness was why my friend had to ask me whether or not I saw what she saw, and it was why I didn't question her needing my confirmation.  I'm not sure how long it took us to realize that a big contribution to this strange ""vibe"" we were experiencing was the craft's utter silence.  It wasn't merely an absence of engine or other familiar aircraft noise; it was an intense, all-pervasive silence that was eerily powerful precisely because it was so absolute.  It was a consuming silence, the likes of which I cannot recall experiencing in any other situation. I have always remembered that silence and have tried to describe it on the few occasions that I have discussed my ""sighting"" over the years with friends.  But it wasn't until I happened to catch a bit of a cable program the other night that I heard another so-called witness state that she had viewed a completely silent airborne object.  That was the first time I had ever heard a UFO-sighting detail that matched my own experience, and it made me snap back to the events of August '85.  I researched online and came across this site; now that I've read numerous other reports, I understand that very many people indeed have witnessed silent crafts.  A few have also seen triangular crafts (another detail from my personal encounter that I had never heard elsewhere).  Obviously, I have not made a point of keeping up with ufology!  Hearing and reading some other people's testimony has encouraged me to share my experience now.  Although I have never doubted the nature of what I saw that night, the content of other witnesses' reports lends credence in my mind to my personal memories, legitimizing them somehow. So I will continue with my report:  I and my friend stopped walking to watch these lights for awhile.  At some point, we became aware of a sixth light.  It was the same color and size as the large dull-red light which marked the center of the ""nose"" of the ship, and it was straight back from that light.  (Imagine an arrow, designated only by five points outlining the tip of the arrowhead and a single dot at the base of the arrow).  Here is where my friend's and my accounts differ; one of us thought that the space between the original five lights and this single sixth light encompassed about one football field's length, but the other thought it was closer to two football fields long.  After all this time, I don't recall which of us insisted on which length.  Let me reiterate how hard it was to determine size and distance in that environment. Now that we saw the sixth light (it, too, just quietly asserted itself; it may have been there all along, or it may have appeared after the others), we determined that the entire area in between must be one giant craft.  This final light marked the middle of the third leg that formed the base of the triangle.  I know that my friend and I agreed that the ship was triangular and basically flat, but as far as I remember, we couldn't actually see an outline.  It was like this ship swallowed the whole night sky above us.  I remember just barely discerning the distant horizon break between the dark blue ocean & the deep black sky, and my vision was 20/20 at the time.  So if the night really was as dark as I am remembering, the craft was either pitch black itself or it was utterly transparent. We never questioned that the sixth light belonged to the same craft.  All of the lights moved in tandem.  They slid so smoothly and slowly across the sky that their motion was almost imperceptible.  They moved in the same direction in which my friend and I had been walking, and then shortly after we stopped to watch them, they stopped, too.  After I'm not sure how long, we tried moving forward again, and the craft moved with us.  We stopped again; it stopped again.  I think anxiety started seeping in to me about then if it hadn't already.  Perhaps the coincided movements were an optical illusion, as when you view a painted portrait from many angles and it seems to always be looking directly at you.  But my friend and I got the very definite impression that the craft was watching us.  We reacted by speaking in low murmurs as if it could hear us, and for some reason I got it into my head that we ought not stand looking at it for too long at a stretch or it would overpower us.  I kept having to shake off a certain numbness -- not so much a physical numbness as a mental one.  It was very easy to fall into a sort of spellbound state as we watched these lights. Eventually, we decided to head back in the direction we'd come from.  I think we were both beginning to feel frightened, but the onset of fear was slow.  We turned and walked back down the beach, and lo & behold -- the craft switched direction, too.  It did not turn; it just moved ""backwards,"" so that the sixth light -- the second red light -- now became the ""front.""  I remember feeling a bit scared, but more giddy.  It was like a game we were engaging in with this strange craft.  Now we stopped and waited for awhile to see what might happen.  My friend felt less anxious than I did, and I took courage from her equanimity at first. I don't know how long we stood there.  It was probably under 10 minutes, maybe even under 5 minutes, but it could have been hours.  I had absolutely no grasp of time.  I know that I got that numbness again because I realized at some point that my friend had sunk down to the sand and I hadn't even noticed.  She and I had stopped talking.  The object mesmerized us, or we allowed ourselves to believe that it did.  It continued to merely hover, stationary. After we had watched it for some time, rain began to fall, lightly at its start.  Maybe it was the rain that jolted me back to my senses or maybe I just ""came to"" again of my own accord, but whatever the reason, I forced my attention away from the lights.  I bent down to look at my friend's face.  I had to get close up to her because of the darkness, so when I looked in her eyes, we were only a few inches apart.  I remember that what I saw in her eyes sent a chill through me.  She was smiling a strange little smile and her eyes were all glazed over.  It wasn't like she was totally unresponsive or anything, but there was an unnatural excitement and faraway attitude that she conveyed.  (I should clarify here that we were both very much drug-free).  When she spoke -- something like, ""you're in my way, I want to see them"" -- her voice quality had changed, too.  It was then that I understood that what I'd taken for her equanimity was actually closer to her willingly ""zoning out.""  That really scared me.  The rain started to fall harder. Then, quite suddenly, the whole craft just took off at a speed that made my breath catch in my throat.  Again, absolutely no sound unless it was quieter than the rain.  The craft went up the beach about a half-mile at approximately a 30-degree incine, and there it stopped near a short cliff.  At first we thought it wasn't doing anything, but then we noticed that the positions of the lights relative to one another seemed to change.  That was because, as we soon figured out, the craft was turning around.  It did not bank at all -- the nose did not dip down.  The whole craft just turned on a flat plane.  Oddly, as it turned, we could see all of the lights all of the time.  It was as if the inside of the craft were invisible -- we could see the ""nose"" lights through the ""tail"" light like no craft was in between.  Yet we had no doubt that there really was a craft in the shape of a triangle, not just disconnected lights.  So I think that the ship must have been very, very flat. Another few minutes went by, during which we couldn't tell what the craft was doing.  But then we understood that, in a slow, steady, direct line, it was returning -- it was approaching our area again.  It was moving so deliberately and so directly towards us that at first we hadn't been able to perceive its motion.  Somehow, seeing those lights begin to get larger with the perspective as the craft neared again, my friend and I finally got filled to bursting with a sort of elated terror, and we ran all the way back down the beach where we'd come from and then up a gravel road to our cabin.  The rain was furious now and blinding.  I am not a sportive person, but I ran fast and hard that night with no regard for my bare feet on the rough gravel.  They got fairly cut up from our run. I remember seeing other people on the beach as we ran back.  Being 14, we yelled loudly all the way home, garbled giddy warnings about ""the lights!  the lights!  don't let them take you!"" and so on.  People flitted past in a blur as we ran, but I do remember some puzzled looks on people's faces.  It occurred to me later to wonder whether they even saw these lights at all.  But when I and my friend finally got back to our empty cabin (my parents were out for the evening), we slammed & locked the door and turned on all the lights and pulled down all the blinds -- and as we yanked down the blinds, we kept peering through the windows.  We couldn't see the lights where they should have been.  The whole run back had taken maybe 5 minutes and we hadn't checked behind us to see the location of the lights since maybe 2 minutes earlier when the other houses had obscured our view.  Now, gazing through a back window, we finally located the lights again.  Maybe the reason we had gotten puzzled/startled looks from people as we ran was because the craft had zoomed off, far past the area where it had made that no-bank turn earlier, and higher up.  It must have moved very quickly.  The fact that it had flown away again rather than continue to move toward where we had been standing excited us because that ""confirmed"" that the craft had actually been focusing on me and my friend.  We decided that it had wanted to abduct us and that it nearly had.  I'd still like to think that.  But who knows.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,,

On one night, these lights appeared to be performing some sort of synchronized movements, moving in large circles at antipodes from each other, and reversing direction. I just finished watching the special on the Discovery channel about the lights seen over Phoenix during March of '97. I was impressed by the videos of the supposed 'flares', and was reminded of a similar occurance many years ago. Over the course of the month of January 1988, only on weekend nights as these were the only nights I was out, I witnessed in the western sky over Memphis, sometimes 2, and sometimes 4, bright amber lights similar in appearance, color, and 'texture' to flames seen from a great distance. Each night after 0100, while driving south down Old Germantown Road, I saw these lights above the western horizon, in the direction of Memphis International Airport. Sometimes the lights merely hovered, or moved very slowly, almost too slow to notice movement, but on one occasion, my curiosity having been excited by previous sightings, I noticed two objects moving in a large circle, as though orbiting a central point- the circle being approxiamtely 3x the size of a fu! ll moon. The objects maintained a 180 degree opposition to each other as they circled, and once a circle was completed, they reversed direction to complete another circle, before reversing direction again. On this particular night (I cannot remember the exact date), I stopped the car to watch them, and sat parked for about 15 minutes before I got bored, having watched them perform 3 complete circles, so i continued on my way, sure that I would see them again on some other night. And I did, but never again were they so active as on that night. Since then I have seen similar phenomena which proved to be landing lights of comercial aircraft approaching over a great distance on a clear night: the same color and quality of light, the same apparent slow movement, but I have never before or since witnessed such a 'ballet' in the sky. It seems remarkable and highly unlikely that any comercial or military aircraft could move with such precision being separated over so large an area as ! was suggested by the apparent distance from my vantage point, and even more unlikley that such aircraft could stop and reverse direction without slowing.  I have never before reported this because it seemed to me too weak a sighting to be of much consequence; I was never able to identify the objects as anything more than 'lights in the sky.' But after seeing the Phoenix videotapes, I was amazed by the similarity to what I saw over those nights so long ago. These were not my only encounters during the same 12-month period, but it has been so long now, I don't that my information can be of much value. I am, however, interested in relating what I have seen, both in the sky and elsewhere, to interested scientific and documentary authorities.  If needed, i can supply photocopies of maps showing my position and the direction of the sightings.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,35.12547266265719,-89.92692482230727

I looked up to the west, north west and observed what appeared to be a rather large sphere shaped object travelling from south to the north, maybe northeast about 1 to 2 miles away. It was possibly black or dark grey in color and possibly rotating. I say possibly rotating because as it flew on there was some type of either light or streak on it that appeared to rotate around the object end over end. The object was travelling somewhat faster than any aircraft in the area that morning. There was a small private plane that was approximately 5 to 10 miles away to the south travelling west, at what speed I do not know.

I looked around the sky to see if I could see any type of military aircraft following or attempting to intercept, since Selfridge Air National Guard Base is approximately 5 to 7 miles north of the marina I was at.

Had three flashing bluish/white lights that flashed in a counter-clockwise triangle. I, who was 13 at the time, and a friend who was 14 were camping out under the stars in my back yard. It was a mostly clear night with a full moon and some scattered high cirrus clouds. My friend saw the object first and immediately pointed it out to me. It was three strobe-like lights flashing in a counter-clockwise triangle. It was moving very fast across the sky from north to south. It passed over the scattered cirrus clouds, so I estimate it must have been above 50,000 feet in altitude. It would move irratically from side to side and diagonal while maintaining it's forward (southerly) course. It was as if it was actually jumping like a water bug. Since it was at least 50,000 feet in altitude, I estimate when it jumped it was jumping at least a couple of miles at a time. We observed the object until it cleared our horizon (until we could no longer see it). It was moving too fast for me to even run and get my telescope out of the house. It cleared our horizon in about 45 seconds time. A passenger jet at altitude takes nearly five minutes to clear our horizon. Taking that into consideration, this thing must have been moving at thousands of miles per hour. It didn't leave a contrail of any kind and it made no sound. I never actually seen the body of the object; all I could see was the lights, so I'm assuming it was shaped like a triangle because of the pattern of the lights. The lights were not very bright -- they were like a strobe in the sense that they flashed similarly to a strobe but they were much softer then strobes. They were bright enough to see through the cirrus clouds when passing above them. I called the local Air National Guard and they refered me to a UFO reporting line, which I called and reported to. They seemed quite interested in my observation. I have never seen this object or anything similar since. It was a very exciting night for a couple of young teenagers. As for backgrounds, we were just normal kids. I am thankful that we were able to see such an awesome sight. I will never forge! t it.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,39.458204405286345,-77.96052114537444

On a recent trip to Colorado Spring in the Fall of 1998 between employment, I picked up a paper that serves several towns 15 to 50 miles east of Colorado Springs.  The headline in the August 27, 1998 ""RanchLand News"" (published in Simla, CO) described recent UFO sightings.  The article described a UFO sighting exactly like I personally had while driving south from Colorado Springs on highway 115 in the late 80's to 1990. Every time I stopped at a convenience store on Hwy 24 East of Colorado Springs over the days I was there, I mentioned the UFO headlines of their local paper.  To my surprise many locals shared of their sightings near this multiple Air Base region.  One man of 'credible' nature who is a pilot said him and his wife were driving east on Hwy 24 to Colorado Springs when they saw a large ball of fire heading towards Cheyenne Mountain (NORAD).  He added that it veer to the right along the mountain and disappear over the side then went towards ""Pikes Peak"".  Both him and his wife saw this at about 5 a.m. earlier this summer.  I then told him of my 1990ish sighting and he commented that the UFO I saw stationary in the sky must have had a ""fuel problem"". Until this recent trip to Colorado Springs I never really talked about the sighting much to anyone.   In re-driving the hwy 115 I found at about the county line what I believe is the location where I had the sighting.  There is evidence of brush having previously been burnt there—perhaps set by the flaming UFO? This is what I remember of my earlier sighting back in the late 80's to 1990: It was late at night--probably 11:00 p.m. or later.  I was driving south of Colorado Springs on highway 115.  Fort Carson is on the East Side of the road.  About 4/10ths to a half-mile to my front-left just over a notch in a ridge was a large object suspended in the sky. It was brightly flaming on the bottom and dripping profusely toward the ground over the ridge.  At first I thought it was a ""dirigible"" (large blimp) on fire, but it was only burning on the lower half.  Being that it was over Fort Carson, I thought that it might be some kind of military base experiment.  I pulled over to the side of the road for a few minutes, but then just shrugged it off and drove on.  I never drove the road again until this fall of 1998.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,38.861478298238076,-104.78039776536313

On the above date and time, myself and 5 other deputys were working a drivers' license check at the main intersection of a small rural community in our county.I had just released a motorist to go on his way when I heard one of the deputys exclaim,""What the hell is that!"" I turned to face him and looked in the direction he was looking, which was to our northwest. It was not hard to see what he was looking at. I observed an object whose shape was hard to determine at first, as it appeared to be coming almost straight at us. I did easily notice the long trail of exhaust and flame that trailed the object. The object progressed rather slowly, about normal aircraft speed, from our northwest(right), to eventuaslly end up to our southeast(left). As the objectbecame closer and crossed our field of vision, a shape could be better made out. At first, a couple of us thought it might be an airliner that was on fire, but we could not make out any wings or tail structure. The glow from the trail of fire was illuminating the rear of the object somewhat. It should be noted that this sighting occured on a cloudless night with a 3/4 moon in the western sky, many stars visible, and a very clear view as we were far away from any city lights. When the object crossed between our position and the moon in the west, we could discern a cigar-like shape, reminiscent to me of a large missile(icbm type). The others present were in agreement as to the shape of the craft. At a point where the object was moving away to the southeast, but still mostly in front of us, we observed a very bright and instantaneous explosion near the ""nose"" of the object, immediately followed by approx. ten small objects which streaked toward the ground in a fan pattern, disapperaing in the proverbial""twinkling of an eye"". In fact, if we had blinked, I'm sure we would have missed them, they moved so fast. At that point, a couple of us were saying our prayers and waiting for the blinding flash and mushroom cloud. The closest thing I could think of to describe what I was seeing was an icbm that had just MIRV'ed. There was fortunately no explosion, much to our surprise and relief. We continued to watch the main object progress in controlled flight, to the southeast fo our position, until it finally became nothing but an orange circle of light, as if we were now looking straight at the rear end of the thing. We continued to watch the object until we could no longer see any sign of it. It flew out of our sight. It did not explode, blink out, disappear, or streak off at an unbelievable rate of speed. Once we rgained our composure, I radioed the sheriffs' office and asked the dispatcher to call the FAA Flight Control Center in McAlester. He asked me what was going on because he was already getting calls from citizens around the county who had also seen the object. He called the FAA and they had no report of any scheduled aircraft or any aircraft at all for our area. Within a few minutes, the dispatcher advised me he had received a teletype over the state law enforcement net of the report of an object that landed in a farmers field near Anadarko,Ok.(approx. 130 miles west of McAlester.), and that personnel from Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City were enroute to see what it was. That was the last we heard about this until the next day. I channel surfed the news all day long, checking for any mention of this incident, to no avail. Of the seven separate news stations we had available, not one mentioned anything until 1730 that evening when KOCO channel 5 in OKC made a statement that if you saw a bright light in the sky the night before and wondered what it was, you were not alone. They claimed officials at Tinker had no idea what it was either. At a second newscast on this same channel 30 minutes later, in fact, during the weather portion of the broadcast, the weatherman stated that officials at Tinker had determined that what we saw was a Russian ""booster rocket"" re-entering the earthe's atmosphere and burning up due to friction. Well, I'm no ""rocket scientist""(pun intended), but what I saw was on a perfectly level trajectory(horizontal) with no angle. There was definitely a large streak of flame behind the object, but it was emanating from the rear of the craft, not the nose as you would expect if the flame was caused by friction. The craft was not on fire, it was under propulsion. No other mention of this incident was ever heard by me. Those of us who saw it don't talk about it anymore. I still have video of the few seconds KOCO devoted to it though.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,,

I was distracted by a very intense light by the horizon on the hills where ther are no houses or roads. This very intense disc of light made is way over the side of the 57 highway and was causing cars to start pulling over to side of the road on both roads. It would come closer and lower and then go back up and farther away. It took me about a minute to stop the car and get out. By that time it was gone. The way it disapeared was very strange. It shot up into differnt spots in the sky that were not to distant, however; Every time it would move it would go from a complete stop to an increadable speed in an instant. It would also go from an increadible speed to a complete stop in an instant. At the end it seemed to break up into about 8 distinct balls of light that were many miles up in the air. I am very good with estimating speed and acceleration of jets and rockets. I would estimate that this object must have accelerated to a speed of 10,000 MPH in a fraction of a second only to come to a complete stop and accelerate again on a vector that was in the opposite direction.

We were going to install a motion light for my step-grandmother.  We were stopped at an intersection stop light.  An oblong bright blue (cigar shaped) object had appeared in the sky from what seemed out of nowhere.  It was stationary in the sky for perhaps less than a second and then accelerated and disappeared again it what seemed a split second.  When I saw the object appear in the sky, my first reaction was to point at it and comment on it to my father (he is a law enforcement officer)  But before I could even say a word the object had disappeared.  Both of us remained speechless.  After a minute or two I asked him if he had seen the object and what he thought it was.  We were both astonished and speechless which perhaps explains the initial silence.  We had both commented on the bizaar sight and suggested that it had been an UFO. I was quite suprised by my father's suggestion and acknowlegdement that it may have been an UFO.  We have never spoken a word to one another about it since that day. It just seems too awkward.

Strobe-like flash accompanied at point of near-impact. I was driving 55-60 mph on the highway south of Pleasanton, NE, when I saw a small, orange, fluorescent object ahead in the distance. I dismissed it as a powerline reflector usually seen near small, rural airports, forgetting that there is no airport (to my knowledge) in that area.  It was just dusk and darkening into night, and the object seemed to get dimmer as I drove south, eventually fading out of sight, so I assume it was travelling in a southerly direction along the highway, perhaps a little faster than I was driving. A few minutes later, as I was passing a familiar farm site with house and grain elevator in the yard, a white/silver spherical object, about 9 inches in diameter, came down out of the night sky and rushed directly at my car. Its path was over the hood and up the windshield, a few inches above the vehicle.  I felt a rush of wind and heard a loud swooshing sound as it passed over.  My reaction was to duck and swerve the car slightly to the left, but my reaction occurred after this quick event.  There was a bright, strobe-like flash as it reached the top of my windshield and flew up over my car. The flash enabled me to see several feet from the vehicle, over to a power pole in the ditch, and a power line extending over the highway from the pole, so the object had to go beneath this line.  I tried to see it in my rear view mirror, but sited nothing, and sped on south to Kearney, NE.

My mother is especially rigid due to her profession, but what we saw was undeniable. My mom and I were driving along 17 Mile Drive about 22:05 one evening and we were perplexed by this glowing green light off the coast near Spanish Bay beach. We thought it might be shrimp boats(shrimpers fish usually in the middle of the night & use irridescent green lights to attract the shrimp to the surface) but there were no boats on the surface of the water and the green area was far larger than shrimper lights. Plus, shrimpers as well as other fishermen do not usually fish off the coast of Pebble Beach,it is exclusive & private. We kept driving, away from Spanish Bay, until we reached the Lodge. The green light was out of our sight as we entered the forest area. We were turnin! g to go home when I said, ""That light was just too weird, lets go see if it's still there."" My mom was scared but we turned around and headed back towards Spanish Bay. About 22:18 the green light came back into view, underwater illumination that from a distance appeared to be a dome shaped structure laying on the floor of the ocean. We speculated that it was the lost city of Atlantis, it was really creepy, we were the only car on the road and we were both overwhelmed with a desire to turn around and head away from the scene. We continud a bit further, then we flipped a U-turn and began in the opposite direction again(I was  the passenger, with my side of the car facing the ocean at this point) Just as we accelerated to go, I looked out my window at the green dome, and this bright light beam shot out of the water and came directly to my window. I screamed and my mom hit the gas. We were going 81-85 miles per hour for about 10 seconds and the beam continued to shine in my window! , it's origin still the green dome under the water. I kept screaming and tried to climb into my mothers seat to escape the light, and suddenly the beam retreated back the way it came until it was back in the dome and disappeared. There was noise of some sort, like ringing at an almost inaudibly high pitch when the light was present, then it was gone when the beam retreated. We were both in shock, my mom drove home and I don't remember very much except talking to Pebble Beach Secirity with my parents later that night.

This was years ago, so my memory of exact times and dates may be assumed to be a ""best guess"" but all details of the objects, and their behavior are still completely clear in my mind. A close friend and I had been working our tails off all year without a break, as we were both enrolled in the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and he(my friend) was also employed as the assistant to the broadcasting(mass comm) department(in which I was taking classes at the time), and in addition we produced a public access cable show in our spare time, which there was little of. In short, we needed a break, and thought it would make an interesting show if we documented ourselves winning the florida state lottery, so we used the show as an excuse for a road trip, and took one of the department's cameras with us (no, we didn't expect to win, but if we had it would've made great television). So after a long drive from Birmingham, and a long afternoon of filling out lottery tickets, neither of us wanted to drive back, so we found a cheap motel, and put away our stuff to stay the night. It was about 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon when we both went out to the beach behind our hotel, and plopped down into a pair of those wooden beach chairs, and admired the calm sea, making small talk as the sun sank to the horizon. I don't recall which of us saw it first, because at first we didn't think anything of it, as there had been planes in the sky all day, and this seemed at the outset to be just an oddly-colored set of airplane lights. Although after about 15 or 20 minutes the lights hadn't moved, and we both took notice then. There were two rows of lights, the top row was an arc of four (reddish-violet in color)and were larger (not brighter) than the bottom row of three (bright yellow) they were arranged like this: O O   <----Violet arc of lights O ... O ^------Yellow row of lights My initial thought was of a jetliner with four violet lights on the front of it's wings, and three bright yellow tail lights, seen in perspective flying towards the land. However since it was somewhat within a cloud, no structure was apparent. Also, nothing that size(jumbo-jet size) that I know of can hover, noiselessly (or if it did make noise, it was drowned out by the incoming surf). We watched the object, for a few moments, and it dawned on me that we had a camera in the trunk of the car, and there might be some way to profit from having a (near)professional quality UFO video (students are often broke, y'know), so I told my friend to go get the camera-he had the keys (we had driven in his car). He refused to be moved from staring at the thing, and I quite frankly, didn't want to miss a moment either, so we stood there arguing about who should get the camera, while waching the object, when it dissappeared, like somone flipping off a light switch. We both stood there for a moment, then I sat back down on the chair, as did he, and we started talking about what we had just saw, and UFO's in general. By this time the sun had completely set, and we could see stars in the (mostly) clear sky. As we sat there looking around for any other strange things, we both noticed a number of planes in the air(or should I say red tail lights of planes)passing overhead at extremely high altitude, always in pairs, from right horizon to left (west to east) then back again. There must have been more than a dozen planes in the air in the next hour, before they finally stopped flying over our position. When the sky was clear again, as if on cue the object reappeared just as suddenly as it had vanished, and seemingly hadn't moved an inch. This time I was yelling ""GET THE CAMERA!""(while elbowing my poor pal), and as we watched, another set of lights appeared, to the right, and above the first set(this time it was too dark to see if there was a connecting structure), and the first set of lights slowly faded away. After the dissapearance of the first object, my friend (FINALLY) trundled off back to the car, to get the camera. as he went away, so did the second object, lightswitch-style. Then I looked around the beach, and noticed that there wasn't a soul in sight. I must admit it-I got the creeps at that point, with the mist and surf slowly creeping up to the chairs, it was all I could do to sit still, and not run ! off to help my friend with the camera. As I sat there looking at the sky, I saw one final display. It was as if one of the objects was turned upside-down, right next to the other, with all lights on both glowing an intense yellow. Like this: O O O ... O O ... O O O This flashed brightly for a moment,low near the horizon, then was gone. After many long minutes my friend returned with the camera, tripod, and batteries, plopped it all down, and we both set it up. We searched the sky for an indeterminate amout of time to no avail, there was to be no more light show that night. But as we packed up to go back to our room, there was one other person on the beach who walked up to us and asked if we had seen the lights, too. ""Yes,""we replied ""what the hell were they?"" ""Don't know, but that's been going on all week"" he replied. I later determined(by looking at our handy road map)that to our west was Eglin AFB, the likely source of the planes, and nearby was Gulf Breeze, which I later suspected may have been the source of the other things. Additionally, the lights of each set of lights never never changed position relative to each other which is what leads me to believe that there were two seperate objects whose surfaces were adorned with these lights. Also, the lights gave off an aura (almost like neon, but as bright as incandescent) which readily differentiated them from regular lights (though during the daylight sighting I attributed this aura to the lights being inside the boundary of a cloud, diffracting through the water vapor, but at night- it was a whole different story). Also , when we got home, my friend and I drew sketches of what we saw seperately (to make sure we both had the same experience) and they matched exactly.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,30.20772994923858,-85.62376675126903

The first time I saw it I was driving home from work aroung 6:30 pm EST. It had been dark for half an hour. I was traveling north on 441 about 7 miles north of Gainesville on my way home. I then noticed this orange ball of light hovering above the treeline. It just sat there. It glowed but didn't move. At first I thought maybe it was a heicopter searching for something, but the more I looked at it I realized it couldn't be a helicopter because the light wasn't a searchlight. It didn't reflect a beam of light: it just glowed. It couldn't have been a plane or helicopter because there were no other lights on it and no strobes. There are some towers in this area but it wasn't them because I could see them off in the distance and besides they having flashing red lights on them. I didn't stop to watch further because I had to get home. It was still in the same place as I watched from my rear view mirror until I was too far away from it to see it anymore. The second time I saw it was about a week later with my wife in the car as well. It was in almost the same spot that I saw it in the last time, but I think it was further north along the road. She didn't want me to stop and look at it so we continued on home. I saw it again about a week after that. So this time I stopped my car on the edge of the road to check it out. Unfortunately because of the height of the trees next to the road, it blocked my view of the orange ball of light. There was no sound from that spot in the sky. I thought surely I would hear an engine of some kind, but I didn't. When I got backl on the road I could still see it above the trees until I was too far away to see it anymore. I never reported this to anyone because of the skepticism most authorities have towards this type of siuation.

I got my binoculars on the object traveling north to south first and as I was facing east the object was traveling from left to right in my field of view.  I quickly noticed approximatly 12 white or yellow lights, 6 running down each side of the craft in a V or triangular shape.  I almost could not believe what I was seeing.  There was this V shaped craft that had to be huge considering how high it was.  Without the binoculars I could have easily just passed the lights off as airline traffic.  But the craft were were large enough to easily make out the triangle shape with binoculars. Especially when I began to look at the other craft, which actually still closer to me than the one heading south. The second craft was heading east and was moving directly away from me, giving me a perfect view of the V shape.  And I would have to say that a V is a better discription of the craft than triangular because the craft seemed longer rather than wider.  Each craft proceeded in a slow steady manner and I remembered thinking how can these two ships be flying over OKC and there seemed to be no other planes up and interested in them.  I also thought that two identical craft passing each other the way they were was odd, almost like they were mapping something.

I went with friends to watch a meteor shower in the desert. It was late at night and we could hear normal night desert sounds. We were all watching the falling stars when one person noticed lights slowly approaching. As the lights neared us we saw three triangle shaped craft flying in a triangle formation. The craft were (RAM?)black, with three lights on each one. I do not remember which lights were red and which were white, but each craft had red and white lights on the 3 points. The craft were 500 to 1000 feet above us as they went past. They were moving at about 350 mph judging by how low they were and how long it took them to pass. They were completely silent, as they passed we still heard the desert night sounds. there were no car engines running or lights on,(so I do not know if they would have had any effect on them,) as we were all watching the sky. Most of us they worked at the air force plant and held security clearances,  but none of us had ever seen any craft like that before. We were all used to watching fighters and bombers fly by, so were used to judging aircraft size and speed. We had never saw an aircraft that was a perfect triangle float past us at 350 mph though! They flew/floated overhead and vanished in the distance. The profile of the craft were very low. We saw the light before we saw the craft and the craft outline vanished before the lights disappeared. We were used to seeing F117 fighters, and these were not shaped like them. I worked briefly on the first F22's and they were not flying yet. Besides, both of these craft make a lot of noise and cannot glide that long and that low without power. This craft was powered by magnetics or atomic/nuclear fuel. There was no exhaust vents visible on the trailing edge of any of the three craft. It was probably 11:30 at night and as they passed no heat from them distorted any stars behind them as they passed. I heard of Art Bell seeing a single triangle craft abou! t the same time, or a bit after we saw these three. The artists rendition of his craft on his web page makes the craft way to big. They were all three the size of an F15 or F16, not any bigger than that. I realize this happened in 1993, and it is now 1998, but I told the story to people I worked with when I was transferred from Palmdale to Everett, Wa. Those people could vouch that I told them about it in 1993. Besides, I did not know who else would care, as it was not the classic round ball of light or flying saucer sighting, and we did not have any camera's.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,34.71551165644171,-118.16635122699385

( it was white, no plates, 1 black window on the side) it was approx 1000 feet ahead. as we approached it started to drive off( making no noise even though the path was covered w/ leaves) we rounded a corner and lost view of it for approx 10 seconds when we came around the corner it was gone. the path about 10' wide at the location of the van but either end of the path was WAY TO NARROW for the van to exit the woods.  and the ground was muddy where the van was driving off to but there were no tracks. i was never a ufo believer ultil these 2 days. i am a scientist by heart and practice. I am an environmental biology student, and i think totaly logicaly, and i try and find a reason for everything. but what is saw defies all reasonable explinations. if i heard this report from anyone else i wouldnt believe it but i actually saw it. ill keep my friends name confidential but he can corroberate everything we saw. hope this report helps.  i heard u on artbell saying u could report sightings that happened in the past so i did.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,42.1792962962963,-72.56494814814815

Then it was about 100 meters high and on the other side of a hotel that it at Spencer and University. It was very loud at this time. It was black. It has about 10 lights (It looked like what I would call navigational lights). It was triangular in shape overall. It looked like it was made of about 4 triangles. It had beams holding it together. Kind of like a jungle gym that made a big triangle. Each section was distinct. The lights were placed on the tips of each corner, and on the ""torso"" of the craft. At this time we thought that it was a strange type of plane going in for a landing. Then it occured to us ""Where the hell is it going to land? On the ASU campus?"". Then it flew behind the hotel. The noise went away. Then about 15 minutes later, it emerged from the other side of the hotel. It proceeded in a declining angle of projectory and went behind a parking garage and we never saw it again. Once again as soon as we could not see it we could not hear it.

Very close range. Red lights and yellow lights. We were travelling on our usual route home from a practice at 9:30 pm. As we approached the Shell gas station on Rt. 22 in Bedford I noticed a row of red lights above the station. Hmm, I never noticed a bunch of wires or something with lights there before, I thought to myself. Suddenly I noticed the lights were moving. (The sky was very dark, so at this point all I saw were the lights.) ""What the hell is that?!"" I blurted out to my child.  We turned the corner at the Shell station onto route 172 and I opened my window and kept driving and asked my daughter to keep watching it as it was now still on the drivers side but sort of traveling with my car.  I dont recall any other cars around us.  I opened my window to try to see it better and hear it.  The next thing I said was, ""The thing is HUGE!"" It was more of a feeling because I couldnt see it clearly. (It must have been black.) The shape was more implied than seen--triangular or possibly boomerang shaped, but very straight lines. There was absolutely no sound at all. I couldn't believe something could fly and be that quiet.  I kept thinking of some kind of ""glider.""  Anyway, we drove along and it passed overhead and now it was on my right hand side. I finally stopped the car because it kept going to the north and I wanted to get a look at it, but it disappeared (downwards) behind the tree or brushline just before the highway (Rt.684).  When I first saw it I thought about the fact  that the Westchester Co. airport was only about ten miles away in the direction it was coming from, but I've never seen anything like that from an airport.  My daughter and I went home and drew pictures of it (separately) to show our family. I never reported it to anyone, but I have recently heard a couple people describe the exact same thing......We were not frightened, just interested, and when the thing was going out of our sight we could see yellow lights as well as red.  I remember back 15 yrs or so there was some kind of ufo sightings or hoax or something regarding the ai! rport at Stormville. I am not a UFO buff. This is the only one I have ever seen in my half-century of life. Sorry this is so old. Do you know what this could have been?",1999-01-28T00:00:00,,

Passed directly over our car as we drove west on I-40.  Very large - 200-300 feet long, with circular thing in front on bottom.  Saw beamwork, tubing, ducts, wiring, lights. My husband and I were travelling on I-40 westbound from Alburquerque, New Mexico toward Arizona.  We were approx. 30-60 miles west of Alburquerque at approx. 11:30 pm when I sighted a lighted object at the horizon line, northwest of us. I guess I must have noticed something unusual about it, because I became fixated on it.  It was triangular in shape, with lights.  I remember at least three lights at the point of triangle at front of craft and one on each back corner. It approached silently, at a very slow steady rate.  I continued to stare at it, and the next thing I knew it was gliding directly overhead, over our vehicle and I-40.  It was huge - I would say 200-300 feet long, and very low to the ground, about 3-5 telephone poles in height from the ground.  I could clearly see the underside of the craft as it was illuminated.  It was so big as it passed over it blocked out most of my view of the sky.  I watched it by looking directly up through the windshield.  It now appeared an elongated octogon-shape (rectangle with corners cut.)  I was viewing the underside: There was a large circular thing in the front center, beamwork, ducts, tubes, wiring of some kind. I would say it was dark grey or black metal.  As it glided across the highway heading southeast, and over the car eventually obstructing my view, I then looked through the driver's side rear window to continue watching it....but it vanished!  Completely!  I looked and looked, all over the sky--nothing!  I continued to be alert and watch the sky as we drove that night, but never saw it or anything else unusual again. I should clarify that I was a passenger, sitting in the front seat.  My husband was driving. I am sending sketches of what I saw via e-mail. Reactions:  I had totally conflicting reactions to this event.  The craft appeared mechanical in nature (lights, beamwork, even rivets) so it could have been some kind of military craft.  HOWEVER...the craft was moving at an extremely slow speed. I would estimate my husband was driving about 60 m.p.h, and the craft was moving slower than that.  It made no sound that I could hear.  What is even more bizarre is that even though I viewed it approaching all the way from the horizon, for several minutes, and I strongly desired to tell my husband to look and pull over I did not. I did not say anything. I just watched it!  There were other cars on the highway, and I could not believe they were not all pulling over and freaking out.  They were all just travelling like everything was normal.  Then it disappeared right after it went overhead!  Something 200-300 feet long just disappeared!  I was completely dumbfounded, and just remember continuing to watch the sky for the duration of drive that night. Although I thought I remembered saying something about it to my husband after it passed by, he had absolutely no recollection of the event at all, and said he did not see anything that night, that he must have been concentrating on driving. I think I did not bring up the subject and describe it in detail to him, including drawing a sketch, until we were in Florida a month later.  How could he have NOT seen something as big as a football field fly directly over our vehicle that night, even if he was watching the road? If it was some secret military craft on a test flight, why would it travel over a major interstate slow and low to the ground, with lights and in plain view?  I can't reason this through, and my reactions were definitely out of character.  It has been perplexing me for a long time, and I've always wondered if anybody else on that highway that night also saw it. So I decided I should report it.  I am now 33 years old, female, married, own my own small business, have a bachelor's degree, and currently live on the west coast. I wish my memory was clearer so I could remember more details - I am capable of drawing and wish I could offer more information.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

Observed changes in heading altitude and speed both normal and dramatic. no visible means of propulsion. AT ABOUT 1400 HOURS, APPROXIMATELY ON THE DATE MENTIONED, TWO POLICE OFFICERS AND A CIVILIAN PILOT WERE IN A 182 CESSNA AIRCRAFT ABOUT 10 MILES SOUTH OF A MAJOR NORTHWEST AIRPORT, OPERATING IN THE ARSA UNDER APPROACH CONTROL. THE AIRCRAFT WAS IN A RACE TRACK HOLDING PATTERN ORIENTED NORTH AND SOUTH ABOUT ONE MILE BY TWO MILES, AT ABOUT THREE THOUSAND FEET MSL OVER A FREEWAY. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR WITH BRIGHT OVERHEAD SUN, AND NO WIND, SMOKE IN THE AREA WAS RISING ALMOST VERTICALLY. VISIBILITY AND CIELING WERE UNLIMITED. THE TEMPERATURE WAS MILD TO WARM. OTHER AIRCRAFT WERE IN THE AREA BUT NONE WERE IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY. AS THE TWO PILOTS WERE INVOLVED WITH FLYING THE AIRCRAFT, THE OBSERVER IN THE BACK SEAT WAS SPOTTING VEHICLES ON THE GROUND PRACTICING TECHNIQUES TO ACQUIRE AND MAINTAIN VISUAL CONTACT WITH TARGETS ON THE GROUND. ON THE SOUTH BOUND LEG, ON THE EASTERN MOST TRACK, THE OBSERVER SAW A ROUND BALL LIKE OBJECT ABOUT TWO TO THREE FEET IN DIAMETER WITH A SEAMLESS, MIRROR LIKE SURFACE TUCKED INTO THE FOUR O'CLOCK POSITION, RELATIVE TO , AND KEEPING PACE WITH, THE AIRCRAFT, ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET OUT AND ABOUT THREE TO FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW. THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION, AND NO LIGHT SOURCES. THE ONLY REASON IT WAS VISIBLE WAS THE CONTRAST OF THE SHINY OBJECT TO THE DARK GROUND. THE OBJECT WAS SEEN TO FOLLOW THE AIRCRAFT THROUGH A NINETY DEGREE TURN TO THE WEST, THEN A NINETY DEGREE TURN TO THE NORTH. IT CONTINUED IN IT'S RELATIVE POSITION, FLYING FORMATION WITH THE AIRCRAFT, ON AROUND TO THE SOUTHBOUND LEG. THIS PERIOD OF OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY THE OBSERVER ALONE WHO DID NOT NOTIFY THE PILOTS, NOT WANTING TO BE RIDICULED. TOWARDS THE END OF THE SOUTHBOUND LEG THE RIGHT SEAT PILOT OBSERVED THE OBJECT IDEPENDENTLY AND WITHOUT BEING ADVISED BY THE OBSERVER. UPON BEING ASKED THE OBSERVER THEN ADVISED THAT HE TOO SAW THE OBJECT. THE LEFT SEAT PILOT COULD NOT SEE THE OBJECT AS IT WAS TUCKED IN TOO CLOSE TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. AS THE SCHEDULED TURN TO THE WEST WAS MADE THE LEFT SEAT PILOT MADE AN UNUSUALLY STEEP BANK AND IT WAS AT THAT TIME HE TOO SAW THE OBJECT. THE OBSERVER ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE OBJECT WAS A MYLAR TYPE SILVER BALLON. IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS A VIRTUALLY WINDLESS DAY AND FURTHER THAT THE INDICATED AIRSPEED WAS ABOUT 75 KNOTS AND THE OBJECT WAS MAINTAINING IT'S POSITION AND TURNING WITH THE AIRCRAFT. APPROACH CONTROL WAS QUIRIED AS TO THE PRESENCE OF ANY POSSIBLE RADAR CONTACTS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY. THE REPLY WAS NEGATIVE. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO DIRECT QUESTION AS TO WHAT WAS BEING OBSERVED THE CONTROLLER ASKED THE APROXIMATE RANGE FROM OUR AIRCRAFT TO THE CONTACT AND WAS ADVISED WITHIN ONE QUARTER MILE. THERE WAS A STANDY ORDER THEN AN ADVISORY THAT THERE WERE NO CONTACTS IN THE AREA, AND THEN , ""DID WE WISH TO MAKE A REPORT"". THE LEFT SEAT PILOT DID NOT THINK ANYONE WOULD BELIEVE THE INCIDENT, AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BE WORTH THE TROUBLE. THE RIGHT SEAT PILOT WAS A LOW TIME PILOT AND WAS CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE SANCTIONS AGAINST HIS LICENSE TO FLY. THE OBSERVER WENT ALONG WITH BOTH PILOTS WHO DECISION WAS MADE NOT TO REPORT. THE OBSERVATION CONTINUED AND AN INQUIRY WAS MADE TO THE GROUND UNITS BY THE OBSERVER IF THEY COULD SEE ANYTHING IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE REPLY WAS NEGATIVE, AND WHEN ASKED BY GROUND UNITS IF WE WERE WATCHING A UFO THE REPLY WAS, ""AS A MATTER OF FACT YES WE ARE"". THERE WAS NO CONFIRMATION FROM THE GROUND. THEN AS THE AIRCRAFT TURNED ONTO THE NORTHBOUND LEG THE OBJECT SUDDENLY, AND VERY SMOOTHLY ACCELERATED OUT IN FRONT OF THE AIRCAFT AT ABOUT THE SAME ALTITUDE. IT COVERED THE DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWO MILES IN ABOUT TWO TO THREE SECONDS ACCELERATING FROM ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE KNOTS. THE OBJECT THE EXECUTED A NINETY DEGREE RIGHT TURN TO THE EAST, AFTER A RADICAL DECELERATION AS THE TURN WAS MADE. THIS MANEUVER CAN BE BEST DESCRIBED AS THE OBJECT DISPLAYING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A 50 CAL. TRACER ROUND FIRED FROM THE AIRCRAFT. AS THE TURN TO THE EAST WAS COMPLETED THERE WAS AGAIN A DISPLAY OF ACCELERATION THAT WAS ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE. AGAIN THE ANALOGY OF A 50 CAL. TRACER ROUND IS CONSISTANT WITH THE FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECT. THE ACCELERATION, A BALLISTIC CURVE, AND THE SPEED WERE ALL ABOUT WHAT ONE COULD EXPECT WHEN OBSERVING A PROJECTILE BEING FIRED FROM THAT TYPE OF WEAPON. THE OBJECT WAS SEEN TO ENTER THE TREES ON THE NORTHWEST SHOULDER OF A MOUNTAIN TO THE EAST, APPEARING TO HAVE CRASHED. THAT OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY ONE OF THE PILOTS. THE OBSERVER WAS INSTRUCTED TO FIX THE EXACT LOCATION OF POSSIBLE IMPACT WHILE THE PILOTS FLEW A NORTH, NORTHWESTERLY COURSE FROM THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE PATTERN INTENDING TO OVERFLY AND POSITIVELY FIX THE LOCATION FOR GROUND INVESTIGATION. AS THE AIRCRAFT APPROACHED TO WITHIN ABOUT A MILE TO A MILE AND HALF OF THE POSSIBLE POINT OF IMPACT, THE OBJECT FLEW UPWARDS OUT OF THE TREES AT ABOUT A TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY DEGREE ANGLE TO AN APPROXIMATE ALTITUDE OF FIVE THOUSAND MSL. THE ACCELLERATION AGAIN WAS EXTREMELY FAST AND SMOOTH, BUT AS THE OBJECT LEVELED OUT ON A SOUTHERLY COURSE IT, AS RAPIDLY, DECELERATED TO A MORE LIESURELY PACE, ABOUT ONE OR TWO HUNDRED KNOTS. THE OBJECT CONTINUED ON THIS COURSE FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS TO A MINUTE WHEN IT EXECUTED A LEFT TURN, ABOUT FORTY FIVR DEGREES TO THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST AND ACCELERATED AWAY AT AN ASTONISHING RATE DISSAPPEARING FROM SIGHT IN A VERY SHORT TIME. A SIMILAR OBJECT WAS SEEN AT A LATER TIME IN AN AREA TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE ORIGINAL INCIDENT DISPLAYING SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS ALTITUDE, SPEED, AND LAST KNOW DIRECTION OF TRAVEL, TO THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THIS INFORMATION CAME ABOUT AS A TELEVISION SHOW OF VIDEO RECORDED SIGHTINGS WAS ON. THE WIFE POINTED OUT ONE OF THE OBJECTS, A SILVER BALL, AND MENTIONED HER OBSERVATIONS. SHE WAS UNAWARE OF THE SIMILARITIES OF THE TWO INCIDENTS AT THE TIME OF THE CONVERSATION. THE PILOT OF THE PLANE IS AN EXPIERIENCED HIGH TIME CIVILIAN PILOT. THE COPILOT IS A LOW TIME LICENSED PILOT AND IS A POLICE OFFICER WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS EXPIERIENCE. THE OBSERVER IS A TWENTY YEAR POLICE OFFICER WITH SOME EXPIERIENCE FLYING AND IS A MILITARY VETERAN.

What I saw was a very large, triangular shaped object with off-white lights at each corner slowing moving from north to southeast. The craft could have only been maybe 300-500 feet high and there was absoulutely no sound coming from it. I watched in dis-belief and tried to make sense of it. I thought about the Stealth bomber, but wouldn't that at least make some sound? I could tell that this object was solid, as the middle of it darkened out the clear sky behind it. The lights seemed erie, not bright, but not dull, and they were steady, but also seemed to flicker. It took maybe two minutes for the craft to pass over me and as it began leaving my field of vision, I finally realized that I needed to follow it. I followed it for about another two minutes as it travelled southeast out of my city limits and Im not sure why, but I decided to stop my ""pursuit"".

Later, maybe 5-10 minutes, I noticed the light was still in the same position, yet a little closer.  There now appeared to be two lights rather than one.  Now, it looked more like a stationary obstacle; perhaps the light to a communications or broadcasting tower.  Later still, maybe 3 minutes, I continue to drive at a speed of about 65 mph.

Me and my two children were lying on our trampoline at about 22:00 hours on a beautiful beautiful summer night.  We were watching a metorite shower since this is one of the best times to view one all year long, (being usually the first week in August of every year).  Anyway, we live near the U.S. Army's traing base of Ft. Rucker and that night and many other nights had witnessed numerous rotary wing and fixed winged crafts.  We had seen what we though that night to even be a satellite or two ,--  but anyway back to the story we knew what we were looking at and the Northeast corner of the sky is where our attention was that particular night. My Son , 12 years old at the time was the first to see ""it"", he said ""look at that - pointed to almost the same place of the meteor shower, and what we saw was a perfectly round dark/black object with maybe some sort of illumnination shing up above the craft.  It was moving basically North to South and we witnessed it for maybe five seconds.  The size of the object was approximately the size of a silver dollar or say maybe if you make the O.K. size with you your hand the circle your create is close to the size. We noticed no noise and after it left our field of view we all felt like we had witnessed something very unusual.  My 13 year old Daughter was witness to this also. What makes this very unusual, if that is the correct word, is that I was talking to a coworker - was was also out looking at the metorite showers that week and I was telling him about what we saw on Tuesday night of that week and he said his Son had said to him on Thursday Night of that week ""Dad you will not believe what I just saw ? It looked like a Dark Circle going East to West"".

Out of the corner of my eye I saw something coming diagonally over us from behind.  I alerted ((Name deleted)), and we both got a good long look.  It was approximately the shape of a minivan, and about twice as big.  It was dark grey or black in color, and we approximated that it was between 40 and 60 feet above us, and traveling away from between 30 and 60 miles per hour.  It was virtually silent, except for a slight hum, possibly displaced air. It had no markings that we could see.  The most amazing thing was how it moved, completely steady.  It never sped up, slowed down or wavered in it's course, it was as if it was on a track.  It was so unusual seeing something as large as it was traveling so smoothly, quietly, and slowly in the air without wings.  It was truly defying gravity. It passed over our heads, over the golf course, and then into the desert heading east. Shawn and I have always been bothered by the fact that the description of our sighting does not match any others that we have heard or read. Why was it moving so slow, why did it not have any lights, why was it not shaped like most ""UFO's"" we hear about. I wish I knew!!!",1999-01-28T00:00:00,33.7397,-116.4128

It left straight up when two F/A-18 fighters left the runway on take-off. On my way into work around 5am pst on approx. 12/15/94, I drove over a hill on a main road from Aliso Viejo, CA into El Toro, CA and saw a light in the valley moving back and fourth directly over the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. The point at which I first saw this thing was just before I crested the rise, I was angled to the sky and could not yet see the valley ahead. What caught my attention was this very bright but quite small light that was moving from my left field of view to the right, then instantly left again. The stars were clear and bright that morning I remember and there were no clouds. I first thought it was a police helicopter looking for someone close-by, not an uncommon sight in Southern California. Then I got to the top of the slight incline and the valley spread out before me with all the city lights intact. Directly ahead and just to my right (approx 10 miles) on the valley floor is the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS).I know excacly where it is because I like to watch the jet fighters take-off in the late morning and afternoons. They NEVER take off in early am due to residential noise abatement ordinances. Anyway, this light was NOT a helicopter and was maneuvering directly over the MCAS. I pulled over and watched this thing clearly for a couple minutes. It was not at high altitude and my best guess would put it at 1000 ft. It moved too fast for a plane, from the distance I was to it, it had to be going VERY fast to cover the arc it was maneuvering in. I have seen the Air Force Thunderbirds and Navy Blue Angels at this Air Station Perform and they never covered as much ground so quickly as this thing did . It made many 90 and 180 degree turns and stayed over the base. After only about two minutes of watching this light I could see fighters taxiing on one of the the runways. The light-object left nearly straight up (@85 degree angle to my left) when two F/A-18 fighters left the runway on take-off. As I said, the fighters NEVER take-off in early am. I watched them go airborne! , they quickly turned and accelerated in the direction the light was a few moments before then slowed and continued @ north-west and out of sight. I stayed about another 15 minutes but they did not come back, either plane or UFO.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,,

The 2pm (PDT) sky was partly cloudy, mostly evenly scattered cumulus with a clear blue sky behind them.  I am sometimes given to looking straight up into the sky in search of high-flying raptors or other soaring birds.  As I looked directly overhead,I noticed something moving well above the cumulus clouds.  It was a silvery object about the size of a dime held at arm's length moving in an unwavering straight line from west to east.  I watched as it passed behind the clouds which were moving so slowly as to appear to be completely still.  I would not want to hazard a guess as to its altitude or airspeed.  My first thought was that it was simply a weather balloon. (In fact, I'm still leaning towards that explanation.) As I studied it I wondered if it was in fact not silver, but translucent.  It had a bluish cast but was darker around a well-defined edge and had no irregularities in its shape or surface.  However, a few things didn't rest well with me. I've seen weather balloons in flight before and this wasn't like either of them.  This was perfectly round and had no visible payload.  The others I had seen weren't nearly so symmetrical and were visibly balloons with something suspended underneath.  Also, given that this object was well above the clouds, it would have been a *very* large balloon.  As far as I know, there aren't any launch sites west of Portland used for such launchings.  (That may just be my ignorance in this instance; the only launch site for high- altitude balloons that I know of is near Palestine, Texas.)  I found it odd that it moved so much faster than the lower clouds, though of course the possibility of the jet stream comes to mind. I was also impressed that it moved in such a straight line.  It covered about 30 degrees of the sky in 4-5 seconds. It disappeared behind a solid line of clouds banked up against Mt. Hood and the Oregon Cascades to the east. I have no idea if this was a *real* UFO or not.  In fact, the most remarkable aspect of this incindent may simply be that I saw an ordinary thing in a place most people wouldn't ordinarily look--straight overhead--without some other motivation. It just to be odd enought to warrant reporting to you.  Had I known how to contact anyone regarding this prior, I would have.  When the UFO Center was on the news with the space junk reentry story, I knew where to go.  If you need more info, contact me via email.  Thanks!",1999-01-28T00:00:00,,

I looked around, from a bench on the cliffs, to see if anybody on the cliffs or the pier below, saw the bright ball approach. Now looking north, I saw another yellow glowing ball, between myself and the pier, making a steep decent, then leveling out momemtarily, then rapidly decending behind a house, and down into cliffs below. I am certain that the second ball of light hit landfall. The first glowing ball was now hovering 1/2 mile out over the ocean directly in front of me. The second ball rose up into view again, hovered, then slowly flew out to join the first yellow ball. The strange thing about these glowing balls, was that they seemed to stay the same size no matter if they approached or flew off. The two yellow balls became one while hovering directly in front of the bench I was on.

I thought, Great! Everyone else saw craft in the shape of a suacer and I see one shaped like a Big Mac. As I was driving home, I saw a National Speed Limit Sign. This is when In realised that the thing that I saw was in fact spherical rather than shaped as described above. If you rotate the National speed limit sign in England, around, about 45 degrees and you shrink the black centre line by a little, then you have the basic shape of what I saw. The colour was the same colour as Ragoo, a kind of sandstone orange. I have been asked how big it was? If you take a double decker bus and then split it in half, make the square bit that you have left, round, then this is about the size of what I saw. There were no flashing lights or anything to make this interesting, but I know I saw this object (although I somtimes even dought myself) and I know, having thought about it since, that every natural object, by it's natural shape is spherical. To travel at speeds exceeding light, which is not generaly acceptable today through the scientific channels, we would have to be super-human, but I know what I saw, and I have considered what I saw. I feel completely stupid, but I want to convey my theory, having thought about my experiance for many years. Would someone pleeeeeeeeeease talk to me.

The object i witnessed apeared to be bigger than a commercial airline, in the form of a long cigar (like a 747 with no wings or tail). The object hovered vertically, which was why i didn't think it was an airliner. It appeared to drift slowly to the north after about two minutes..as it did this a white illumination encompassed it. The Illumination dimmed after about three minutes, and when it dimmed completely the object dissapeared (in no direction without sound) Just as we had convinced ourselves it was an airplane refecting the setting sun, a formation of 3 low flying, military style, black helicopters flew by directly over head in the direction we viewed the object.

A bright flourescent green light hovered between 2 houses then swiftly moved to left and then moved directly over us while we sat in ca,Santee,CA,1995-10-15T01:30:00,light,08 seconds,"Occurred : 10/15/1995 01:30  (Entered as : 10/15/95 01:30:00am) Reported: 9/26/1998 20:40 Posted: 1/28/1999 Location: Santee, CA Shape: Light Duration:08 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04445.html,"A bright flourescent green light hovered between 2 houses then swiftly moved to left and then moved directly over us while we sat in car. My friend and I sat in a parked vehicle one night (after a rain storm) and as we spoke, I witnessed a bright flourescent ball of light (like the color of a glo-stick) hovering between my house and the neighbor's house to the left.  When I realized that the ball of light seemed to be suspended there for a few seconds it caught my full attention.  The ""ball"" moved quickly to the left, and for a brief moment ""sat"" in the center above the neighbor's roof.  I was trying to make sense of the unknown light and look for the source from where it could have been shining from.  When I did this, I moved my body so I could have a better view out of the windshield.  I believe I caught the attention of the ""ball"" and then it *immediately* made a bee-line for what seemed to be my face.  The ""ball"" came at me diagonally from the neighbor's roof area.  I screamed aloud.  Just then, the light came upon the top of the car.  It seemed to spread itself out atop the hood of the car.  It moved from the grill area all the way up over the windshield. The shape was almost that of something gelatinous or vaporous when it came onto the car.  In other words, it didnt move as light would move. It seemed to fill the car in a white light with a green tinge to it.  It was *extremely* bright at this period.  I recall feeling very warm and somewhat disoriented. It felt like the light consumed the space around my body; that I was no longer in a car; that I was now by myself in the light.  Then all of a sudden it was gone.  Now, to go back to the point where I screamed--at that time, my friend also screamed for he was reacting to my scream.  He did not see the light in the ball form, nor did he see the light on the hood, nor in the car. In fact, he was not sure why I had screamed. However, he did see the light move down the back window of the car and then vanish.  I did not see the light in the back window nor did I see the light vanish. I wanted to mention that my house is on the east side of the street.  Our vehicle was parked inbetween my house and the neighbors house to the left.  My friend was seated in the drivers seat and I was laying across the passengers seat and my head was on his lap--and yes, I was facing upwards looking at him as we spoke.  We were quite still in movement and I dont think that this ""ball"" of light knew we were there until I made movement to look closer at it out of the windshield.  I wanted to mention that the radio was turned on at a very low volume.  After the green ""ball"" of light left, it increased in volume.  This could have been because my friends knee hit the radio knob, yet I am still uncertain.  I will also mention that I did check the time when I went into the house and was quite surprised to learn that it was *much* later than I had anticipated, although the experience seemed to only last seconds. The entire event felt draining and exhaustive.  After six months or so had passed, I began to notice that I had a marked increase in my ability to learn and my ability to understand analytical issues.  I had wanted to report this experience when it had happened, yet I was too shy or perhaps still questioning what had ""really"" happened that night.  I have since witnessed another ""green ball light"" experience in the same city at a different location with a different witness.  This time, there were 3 balls of light and much further off in the distance.  The experience this time included only the sighting.  This sighting was approx. 11/10/97.  I will be happy to give you the details should you be interested in that experience.  Now it seems to me that I know what I experienced the first time was ""real"" so I have decided to finally report the incident. I will be more than happy to supply my background information to you upon request.  I am uncertain as to what you would like to know in that regard.  Thank you.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,32.85552156862745,-116.99605163398692

The object was huge, and it obscured the passengers' view of Governor's Island.  Many of them reported that the object looked like a city, with lights and a skyline.

Light streams from it along with motor noise.  Closes again and leaves no sign of existence. The following event has been something I have kept quiet about for almost one and  a half years.  It was not until I read an account on this site about a UFO sighting east of my area on 11-27-95 that I realized it might be UFO related.The  phenomena occurred on the night of 11-27-95.  At that period my wife and I would often walk around the hills of our small mountain town during the evening.   It was near 8 PM when we were ascending up a small gulch to the NE of our town.  I happened to look up the east hill slope and saw a large black area.  At that moment a light came on  in the area: it was a large hole in the ground about 50 feet long and maybe 30 feet wide.  It was slightly above us and about 170 feet away.   There was for a short time the sound of a motor, like that of an air-compressor.  The sound was a steady ‘puut puut puut puut’ like a one cylinder engine.  The light illuminated the sides of the hole (actually it was very bright) and we saw the fresh surface of broken rock around the hole's sides.  As we continued to ascend the gulch I told my wife that it was probably the site of a new house being built.  I figured that it was a hole for a basement.  The light was bluish-white like that seen in !the older mercury vapor lights.  The motor sound only lasted a minute and once the light went off only come on again.  I assumed that the owner was in the hole doing work.  Other than wondering how such a hole was dug into solid sandstone I gave no special thought to the event.  I almost decided to walk over and look in but decided not to since the owner might not want me on his land.  We ended up seeing the hole from several heights (both from below and slightly above) and several angles as we walked on towards home.  Several months passed.  On 3-10-96 it was a fine Spring morning and my wife and I decided to go up and see how the new house was coming along.  As we topped the rise above the small gulch all that met our eyes was a smooth hillside covered with old weeds and grass with a few small stones.  Nothing appeared to have been moved for decades!  As a child I had read about such things, but that type of phenomena was one kind that I had refused to believe possible.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,40.2379,-105.4264

Light got smaller and smaller and faded away. While flying from Portland Or. to Burbank, Ca. I noticed a white light outside the aircraft.  It did not resemble another aircraft - no strobes or consistant light patterns. This was just one light - which would change shape (from large ball to a much smaller defined point of light). Object seemed to fly alongside our plane for about 45 minutes.  It was really fascinating and as it changed shape it would also fade in and out of different colors. It went through shades of red, orange, yellow, and very bright white.  This whole time I could see other aircraft along other routes and this object did not resemble or act like any of them and it was not a planet or star (too low on horizon).  It always seemed to stay a consistant distance (hard to judge because it was so dark) yet it would morph into these different shape/color phases. The patterns of color and shape were not consistent and differed throughout the whole time.  I asked the person ahead of me on the plane if they could see it - they acknowledged they could and I told them to watch it for a while.  I noticed that person looking out at it occasionally yet they never said anything about it. Eventually the light seemed to start getting smaller and smaller (like a pinpoint of light) and it eventually disappeared - as if turned off!  It was really quite interesting and I am happy to have witnessed something like that. I have flown many times at night and have NEVER seen anything like that. It behaved like no aircraft I have ever flown on or seen while flying - it was really quite amazing!",1999-01-28T00:00:00,,

Heading north on the 805 frwy just before the junction with the 8 frwy, I noticed four large bright lights in the northern sky, approx just east of Mt. Solidad. I was mesmerized by the brightness of the lights, and the fact that aircraft lights appeared in the sky, but none like these crafts were emitting. I was so engrossed I missed the offramp for the 8 West frwy, I pulled off the freeway at the next availble exit and turned into a parks parking lot, I exited my car and noticed that one of the craft was going to fly directly over me. it was aprox. 800ft. up in the air and seemed to be at least 100yards long. it was T-shaped with the cross of the T at aft. it had Nav lights, however a blue and a yellow light were part of the configuration of Nav lights. (I am an aviation buff, and know aircraft of all types extreamly well. this was like no craft I had ever seen or heard about before (including speculation as to what the Aurora or other experimental crafts look like). the craft emited no sound and moved rather slow. this craft was flying over residential areas and ajacent to Brown Field. Suddenly a bright green light appeared on the crafts left side, and shot off in front of the craft, leaving a green trail behind it. The craft contined south towards Mission Valley joined up with the others and headed S.E. towards Spring Valley and Lemon Grove. I headed back to my friends house, where I was staying, I reported the incident to him and he asked ""what have you been smoking?""  I told him I had a couple of beers while visiting with another friend, but that I was in full control of my senses. The following morning we were reading the paper over breakfast and he told me that the San Diego Union -Tribune was reporting that people had seen lights in the sky the prior night, so I know that what I saw others saw. However, I have never seen an explanation and have never spoken to another person who saw what I saw that night. At the time I was 31 years old and I am a travel executive. I am college educated, an avid reader, and somewhat of an amatuer scientist. As I mentioned before, I know aircraft, and this was no aircraft, I had aver seen before, or since.

It was at approximately 05:11 in the morning that i was on the way to work, I had been driving north for about 45 minutes on the 405 FWY. The morning was dark and it was foggy, the general area was illuminated by the city lights and was not very bright. As i was passing the Sign indicating that the Lakewood blvd off ramp was coming up, I observed  a brilliant green/white fireball with tail about the size of a silver dollar in my windshield. the angle of descent was approximately 40 degrees from left to right from the corner of my windsheild to approximately 6 inches above the base of my windsheild to about 3/4 of the windsheild along the base. It then totally disappeared. I estimate the distance approximately at 1-1.5 miles in front of me from where i was on the freeway The fog gave the fireball a fuzzy appearance around its perimeter. I tried to see if other drivers on the freeway had seen it, but at 70mph and in the darkness it was impossible to make eye contact with other drivers. >From the angle of descent and approximate distance, i judged that the Fireball must have gone in the direction of the many hangars that occupy that airport and also face the freeway. Note: the speed of descent was rapid as if it were falling at great speed. I was expecting a fire or crash in the area of  the projected collision, but as i passed by , there were NO fires or explosions.  I found out that there was no one in the tower at that time, so i could not verify my sighting with anyone. I checked radio news and newspapers at the time ,but no mention of a crash. MY guess is that it was no meteorite( it was too big and there would have been fire), is that it may have been one of  our craft which may have been in trouble and had to ""land"" in the city under extraordinary conditions. I have since heard of fireballs in seattle and i figured i  would finally report it to someone, I figured the police would not accept a report.",1999-01-28T00:00:00,33.79002328838174,-118.17310534232365
