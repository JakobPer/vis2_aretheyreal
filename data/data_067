I didn’t pay too much attention to them until I wound up on long straight road where these 3 glowing orange spheres caught my attention. They were noticeably brighter than all the stars and the glow of a full moon in a clear nights sky. There were 2 other fainter red glowing lights which I figured were planes to the left of my point of view from the 3 glowing spheres. I was driving east and had a good view of the horizon for a while where I couldn’t stop glancing up at the glowing orbs in the sky. I thought that was a strange occurrence and tried to make sense out of what those were. I got back at my house soon after seeing the spheres and took a quick shower. I left the house right away and headed to my friend’s house. I pulled up on top of this hill in my neighborhood and the orange glowing balls were in the same location as when I saw them about 25 minutes prior. I stopped my car and watched these orbs as one stayed in the distance and the other two started moving in towards one another. They get close together when the left one starts to ascend as the one on the right starts moving back to where it was. I paid particular attention to the closest light and it was so bright that it had a glow to it that almost looked like a crown on top of the burning light. They continued to make these strange maneuvers until I left about ten minutes later. I then drove to my friend’s house and pointed these orbs out to them. We could see these orange balls move over the tree lines and move about the sky fairly quickly compared to any planes or helicopters. They certainly weren’t limited to moving in a straight line or having to take a while to change their trajectory. They thought it was a weird sight to see, and my friend had said that he also has seen strange lights in the sky in that eastern direction before. We went inside and I left later on in the night.

My distance to object was 1000 feet horizontal and 100 feet vertical based on nearby billboards I used for reference.  The light was stationary at first.  It appeared like an orange sodium vapor light if viewed at much closer range, about the size of a quarter held at arms' length. I come from a family of pilots, and had an 8 year-long job in a family-business involving lighter than air aircraft.  Based on prior experience, I was surprised that I could not hear helicopter sounds from the direction of what I was seeing.  I assumed this was State Police or a Lifeflight directed toward I287, so I kept watching to see what was going on.  I could hear the airflow coming from the cars on the highway.  Otherwise, there was complete silence.  About three minutes into the viewing, the object shifted to the right side by 50 feet from my perspective.  Again, I was surprised because the precision of the movement, without wobbling or wavering as is usual with hovering helicopters, was unusual.  There was still no sound. Intrigued, I kept watching for another 5m.  After 5m (now it was 04:08), the object began a slow arc over the highway and moved soundlessly deeper into Piscataway and out of my view.  It took 2m to complete its travel outsaide of my sight.  About 20m later, I noticed a helicopter occupy the same spot and follow roughly the same trajectory.  However, this time it was clear that this object was a civilian helicopter because I could see its navigation and collision lights clearly.  I also saw a passenger jet aircraft during the same time at a higher altitude, with its collision and navigation lights as well. I could not get a firm grasp of the shape of the original object.  Its lights did not illuminate it well enough.  It seemed to be the size of an MH-53, which is on the larger side of helicopters and is the size of a small bus. I took about 30 pictures of the object and the follow-on helicopter with my iPhone 3G.

I typically go out on our back deck to smoke a cigarette / drink coffee after waking up.  This morning, I noticed what appeared to be a ""star"" of some kind in the southern horizon, positioned at roughly 45 degrees elevation in the sky.  It was basically a small, faint ""dot"" and dimly lit with bluish-white light.  At roughly that same instant, I noticed the object was moving; my immediate half-awake thought was ""airplane.""  But just as quickly, I realized there were no flashing navigation lights visible.  For the next few moments, it continued tracking roughly southeast at what appeared to be a relatively CONSTANT rate of speed.  It then suddenly accelerated out of my view, appearing to travel ""straight out"" away from my location - and into space?  Upon contemplating what I just observed, there seems to be no other plausible explanation:  (1)  Orbiting objects (such as the ISS or satellites) would simply continue tracking across the horizon; appearing from one side of your vision, then disappearing at the other.  (2)  Celestial bodies (comets, meteors, etc) or man-made objects launched / in orbit around our planet, are generally subject to the laws of physics.  Therefore, their rate of travel would be relatively constant, exhibiting a ""smooth"" and gradual movement across the sky.  (3)  Considering the above, I have never observed any such object ""suddenly accelerate"" to what would have to be an incredible (almost incomprehensible) speed.  I have seen the space shuttle / ISS in orbit, and roughly know what 17,500 MPH looks like from the ground; at first, this thing was going about that fast.  Moreover, and the part that really has me scratching my head; this is the first time I have observed anything seemingly travel AWAY from our planet and into space.

"2 BRIGHT and FAST Round Orange Lights over the skies of Cambria, CA on September 17, 2010",Cambria,CA,2010-09-17T03:00:00,light,45-60 seconds,"Occurred : 9/17/2010 03:00  (Entered as : 09/17/2010 03:00) Reported: 9/17/2010 6:32:36 PM 18:32 Posted: 11/21/2010 Location: Cambria, CA Shape: Light Duration:45-60 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77881.html,"2 BRIGHT and FAST Round Orange Lights over the skies of Cambria, CA on September 17, 2010 Allow me to preface this by saying that I have always been a skeptic of things existing outside of our own world, understanding or knowledge base. You see, I am a practicing Physician, a licensed Medical Doctor, and with all my decades of schooling, I have always been taught to prove things with the Scientific Method, for otherwise, if they cannot be proven or repeated, they do not exist and hence, cannot be called a Law, let alone a hypothesis. My life changed dramatically, however, this evening; September 17th, 2010 at 3 am…the day I am writing this narrative.   My dog was yearning to go outside. I had been awake working on the computer at the time, as I usually do my best thinking in the evening, and I did not have to report for duty the next day. Finally I said OK to my dog and we proceeded to walk outside and into the South-Easterly direction where we always begin our walks. The house faces East and we walk to the right and down our street. It felt about 60 degrees Fahrenheit. There was no wind or breeze at the time and there were no clouds or fog at all in the sky at that time. Less than 2 miles East is the Pacific Ocean. There are pine trees in our neighborhood and some reach 70-100 feet high. However, we had most of the trees removed from around our house due to a recent incident where a tree fell and caused massive damage to some structures.   This evening, upon reaching the bottom of my driveway, I could not help be see a bright orange “ball” in the sky in the South-Easterly direction. It was peering through a distant tree at the time, but it was so bright and beautiful that it could not be ignored. I stopped in my tracks and said aloud,” is that the moon…how could it be so bright or so orange when it is that far above the horizon?!” I moved to my right to get a better view from the street and without any tree in my way, but I did not need to move far as this light was moving…and fast! Within about 3 seconds I saw an identical light behind it, perhaps slightly smaller than the first. Mathematically, one cannot calculate their exact distance away from the Earth, their rate of travel, or their absolute size in space without having a known reference point, something relative to the object in question for reference, or some other known variables to calculate the equations in physics for time, space and travel. Both o! f these were traveling in the exact same path, the second appearing perhaps just slightly lower in the sky than the first. There were no sounds at all…no breaking of a sound barrier, no evidence of combustion or fuel consumption, and there was no sun or moon to be seen anywhere in the sky. These two VERY bright things were being lit-up from within, and not from any reflection or refraction of light. In fact, these were so much brighter than anything I have ever seen in the sky before, including the evening Space Shuttle and rocket launches that I have gone to see in the evenings of the past. I could not make out any specific structure, shape or entity, however, these two “lights” appeared round in shape. I have taken years of Science classes, including Physics and Chemistry courses in college, and I have always taken what I would consider to be an amateur interest in Astronomy by taking elective courses in college, reading literature on the subject and watching scientific p! rograms that relate to our knowledge of the skies above. Note ! that I h ave no problem with my hearing and that I do wear glasses to see afar. My spectacles are always on when I walk my dog so that I can see if there are any wild animals in our path so that my dog does not chase them or get sprayed by a skunk! I had a flashlight in hand but I never turned it on.   Naturally, I began to question myself…”Is that a planet, a star, a jet plane, a rocket or missile or, because of its speed, is it a meteor?!” There was clearly no trail on either “light.” There were no sounds at all…no cars, no planes, no thunder, no sirens or city lights, as I am in the woods here! All I could make out in the distance was a very slight crashing of the waves along the rocky shoreline.   I have never seen this color orange, except maybe when I burned some certain gases and elements in the Chemistry labs. They were so bright (and beautiful)! Both were about the same intensity and hue. Again, there were no trails and no sounds emanating from these, or from my surroundings otherwise. I concluded during my observation that these were not meteors when the second “light” went out for a period of 3-5 seconds and then came on again, just exactly as bright and intense as it went out! It did this two times before I ran to get my wife inside the house. How could a meteor burn out and then come back again just as bright as it went out, and with the same exact trajectory?! The skies were clear and nothing obstructed my view at this time. The second “one” was actually following the course of the first exactly! The one in front stayed illuminated during my entire observation.   I have NO questions in my mind in terms of “what” I was seeing. Please note that I do not take mind altering drugs and that I was not half asleep at the time. I was able to see the clear sky perfectly with my glasses on, as they correct my vision well enough to see planets and constellations without a problem. On occasion I get a reflection out of the corner of my glasses, but this was no reflection! These 2 “lights” were in the sky heading North-Westerly, at such a great speed and without a sound! I even peeked my eyes over my lenses to be certain that I was not mistaken in any way! It was total darkness and in fact, I had not turned on the front porch light and no lights or motion detectors from the neighboring houses were on or activated at that time. Further, there was no question that these were in the sky and traveling at speeds faster than I have ever seen anything fly across the sky before! This includes NASA’s Space Shuttle and the Blue Angel’s Boeing F/A-18 Hornets! at an air show when they make their final pass over the crowd!   I had to have someone else see this! I hesitated for about 25 seconds or so because I did not want to leave them or for them to go away or vanish without me witnessing it. Faster than I have ever moved before, I ran into the house waking my wife with a great sense of urgency. Within about 15 seconds, she was in front of the house with me but by then I did not see them anymore. So I told her to run and follow me alongside the back of the house, in the direction they seemed to have been going, and she did. She confirmed part of what I saw, however, below I will have her document her own experience of what she witnessed tonight with her own eyes! What I saw at that time, from the side of the house, was one bright orange light right through the dense tree that is growing in back of our house. Normally I can’t see a star, let alone a planet, through that pine tree on any other night due to the density of the needles on the tree! These “things” were appearing to travel in a direct! ion over the Pacific Ocean and in the exact same course, or trajectory, where I would expect them to be if I were to extrapolate their path within the sky.   In conclusion, this changed my life forever because now I know that just because we cannot prove something with science, doesn’t mean that it can’t exist. As a scientist, I want proof that whatever these were, they were either something created by humans i.e. the government or some private industry, or that they simply were not. Please! Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) is about 90 miles to the South of me, so I am most curious if they had any activity, documentation, recordings, launches or sightings at that time…3 am on September 17th, 2010. It is fresh on my mind and I shake when I type because I have never been so moved, perplexed , amazed and astounded in my life before…all at the same time! This defies everything I have ever learned and witnessed in my 44 years of life and wonder. I have seen the electromagnetic effects of the earth in the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) and this was nothing like that! As I search for an explanation, I know VAFB is not scheduled to la! unch the Atlas V until the 20th of September.   Please recall that I witnessed two of these “things” and that the one “in back” flashed 2 times at about 5 second intervals during my direct and uninterrupted period of observation. There were no trails, no sounds and no vibrations of any sort. There was no fog, no cars, no clouds, no search lights, no ambient or direct lights and my vision was not impaired by anything for a at least a full 50 degree visual angle.   Without knowing the height of these, the speed is difficult to calculate or imagine. If it was within our atmosphere, I would expect that the sound barrier would have been broken at that rate of travel. Above our atmosphere, even a rocket traveling at a thousand miles an hour could not cover this amount of distance across the sky in that period of time. And they were not going up. They were going across. There were no blinking lights nor any other colors that I could see. I most sincerely hope that somewhere the skies are being recorded at a telescope in California, Arizona or Hawaii that might have documented this event! Or perhaps someone else who witnessed something in the skies this evening will come forward with their independent observations just as I did. My patients may call me crazy and the scientific community might label me an outcast. But I am certain about what I saw and I can’t even conjure up an explanation for this based upon a scientific paradigm. Also, the ! probability of something like this happening to me again in my lifetime is negligible. Therefore, I was compelled to write this down and document it with the greatest degree of accuracy as soon as possible so that unlike a dream, this will never fade from my memory and nor will it become distorted over time or subject to any pressures of embellishment. I am thrilled that my wife got to see a fraction of what I did, but I wish that someone else could have seen this entire event the way that I did. Certainly there was more to it than just what I saw. But I am grateful that I saw as much as I did!   Thank you for taking the time to read about my experience. Having a lot of credibility to lose within the medical community, I would never put my career on the line to make up such a story, nor do I (obviously) have anything to gain from reporting this information. I simply want to share my life-changing experience with those who are curious or who have experienced unusual phenomenon in their own lives. But most of all, I hope this might bring some awareness to the scientific community that we are very likely not alone and perhaps this can act as a catalyst to raise more questions and trigger more research and investigations into finding out if there is a simple explanation for this…or not! My wife reports her brief encounter below. Thank you.    On September 17th 2010 at approximately 3:00am my husband ran into the house screaming that I must come outside immediately. He did not say why. I followed him to the front of the house where he told me to look into the sky where I saw nothing. He then ran alongside the house, tripping on his way up the steps, where he pointed into the sky. I was on the 2nd step and I saw through the tree in our back yard, a VERY bright, large orange light. I took another step up the stairs and moved my head to the side to follow the light and I saw it without the tree in the way. The total time was about 3-5 seconds for me. It looked like it was going up in the sky and in the direction over the ocean. Then it was gone. I told him what I saw and he told me his story. They matched. We took a walk right after that with our dog for about an hour. We looked in the skies, talked about what we saw and we watched about 5 shooting stars within that hour of our walk. This color orange was unlike anyt! hing I have ever seen in the skies, both in terms of hue and intensity. It was as intense as that of the orange part of a blowtorch. It was moving fast. I can’t say if the light went out or it disappeared from my viewpoint.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,35.5954,-121.0184

We stopped at my son's friend's street and they were talking. The sun was setting in the West and my son told me to look at the sky. We saw about 5 things on the sky that looked like comets. They all had a tail, multicolored (but mostly red)but they were not crossing the sky, at first they were all still on the same area of the sky where the sun was setting (we couldn't see the sun anymore)and making short moves. Then one started heading east and flew right over us but it was really high on the sky to the point that I couldn't tell what shape the body actually was, my 10 year son said he could see it and it was a round body. Another one headed south and the other 3 stayed in the same area where we first saw them, 2 of them completely still like a star but with the comet tail flying,the other one started going up and the tail got longer. Then one of the two that were still at first started going down and then they both changed direction and the one that was going up started going down and the one that was going down started going up and it looked like they were going to crash against each other and I was expecting something like a firework explosion from it but at the last minute they passed each other on paralell paths. I had my husband on the phone and was waiting for him to walk up to us and I lost track of one of the 3 remaining objects. The other 2 stayed there still again but as I was talking to my husband they disappeared as well. My husband said he saw the one that went east and I took 4 pictures with my cellphone, the first picture was right after one of them flew east and the remaing 4 were still there. The second picture was of one of them flying south and 3 remaining. The third picture has the 3 that remained. The fourth picture has one of the 3 starting to go up right before they played chicken and that was the last picture because at that point I called the house phone to tell my husband to come see it. My phone's call log tells me I dialed the house at 19:44.

Just behind the plane and object was a formation of delta-wing jet fighter planes. Unsure of altitude, but it was high.    However, it was still close enough to determine that the front plane was a passenger style or cargo plane, and that the planes behind were definitely delta-wing jets.  All planes and the round object appeared to be traveling at the same altitude.  Planes were high-enough to be in view for 30-45 seconds. All planes and the object seemed to be traveling together, but one jet (the left-most in the group) was much farther away from the main grouping. The object was round, but could not determine if it were flat or spherical.  It flew extremely close to the front plane.  It flew as if it were part of the formation.

But as I thought about it I realized it couldn't be a bird it was too large only a hummingbird could hover this way and this looked volleyball sized or possibly basketball sized.   I went and got my camera and  pulled the curtains up over the rod so they would be out of the way.  and made sure the light in the kitchen was off, so there was complete darkness in our house,  I put a piece of tape over the colored light on the front of the camera and looked closely at the window condition, it was still clean from a recent cleaning inside and out.   And that really didn't matter because if what i was seeing was a water drop it wouldn't have been floating around between the Casey,s Convenience store,! and the transformer pole and light pole next to it.     I even got my tripod and set it up to eliminate as much  movement as i could.   In the view finder i could see a brass looking ball the size mentioned, it reflected light like something metal,, and had a faint circle on its side that had a dot on it,, or at least it appeared that way.   I watched it taking pictures without the flash, and got maybe 5 descent  shots of it, finally  up close to the pole not touching it, or being supported by it, and it looked like a faint line had come out of it and was touching some part of the transformer equipment, I don't know its workings so that is as detailed as I can get it was touching the bottom back side of one of the canister shapes mounted there.

On September 20, 2010, about 0005 AM, I went out on our lanai to get the cat in for the evening.  The moon was 3 days before full-moon, the skies were clear and I looked up at the stars.  A single unidentified object was seen moving in an erratic fashion to the Northwest of Vero Beach, FL.  It was about the size and color of a bright star, but I could not determine the distance or actual size of the object.  It is unknown what produced the light of this object (whether it was light, the propulsive portion of the object, or if it was a reflection from the light of the moon). My gaze was at an elevation of 30-35 degrees, so it was easy to observe without straining my neck.  I would estimate it was over central Florida, in the direction of Kissimmee/Orlando but it could have been closer or farther away.   For almost 35 minutes, I watched this object.  At times it appeared to be stationary although it might have been moving directly toward or away from me.  Movement consisted of circles (sometimes clockwise, other times counter clockwise).  It also moved in a straight line at times and sometimes moved with a sudden forward motion, then slowing, then pulsing forward again.  The movements I observed were more suggestive of how a boat might move in the water, rather than any kind of plane, helicopter, or other aircraft.  It was also able to move in one direction, stop briefly, and then move at an angle varying from 20-270 degrees. What was particularly interesting was that this object never moved any further than about 10 to 20 degrees in the sky from the area where I first observed it.  It remained in that area until I left with the cat for the evening, at about 0040 AM. There were no other observers with me during this time. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.

On September 20, 2010, at about 9:15 pm; I was in my backyard letting the dogs go before bed.  I looked up in the North East direction in the sky and observed a large object moving very slowly in the sky, towards my direction.  The object was traveling low in the sky and appeared to have a large fireball tail trailing it. I could see aircraft in other parts of the sky at this time, and the object appeared to be lower than some of the aircraft that I observed. I called my fiancé to come and look at this object because it was like nothing I have ever seen.  It was huge, the size of a comet; which was my first guess as to what it was.  As we continued to watch this object getting closer, the flaming tail turned white and then began swirling around the object.  The object then came to a complete stop, as the white trails continued to swirl around it.  The object itself appeared round and glowed brightly, like a star.  It then simply disappeared right in front of our eyes. The nature of my job makes me a skeptic of sorts.  I have heard of many UFO sightings for which there have been logical explanations.

I found this odd because it was a cloudy night, and no other stars were visible. Also these were the brightest stars in the sky, and I have never seen two stars in that position, especially that bright before. They were the color of street lamps, a orange-ish, yellowish color. I pointed them out to my friend. I kept driving for less than a minute, than I looked back at them and I noticed the bottom star had moved. I told her to watch it and tell me if it's moving.  She started to scream and told me I needed to pull over and see this. So I pulled down a street just before 11 mile in warren MI.  The top star was gone and now this objected was moving away from where it used to be. It was a smooth triangle shape. There were three lights on each corner of it. The lights seemed to be! dimming in and out, but not really flashing. The top one was white and the side ones were light blue-ish and I think light reddish. The body of it was blackish. I could make out a black body because the sun wasn't fully set at this time. it moved north for about 30 seconds till the lights faded away and it was gone. I looked at the other star and it was dimming. What happened next was the dimmed light became the point of this object and then the whole body of it emerged, it looked just like the first one. It followed the same path and then disappeared in the same spot. At this point my friend was very shaken up, so I started to drive off and I saw another 'star' in the sky moving. It was moving around at a pretty steady but fast pace, but I lost sight of it in the trees. I'm not sure what I saw. I just want to know if anyone else saw what we saw.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,42.494305741626796,-83.02442081339713

On Wednesday, September 22, 2010, about 10:10 p.m. my husband and I were at the beach, three miles north of Depoe Bay, Oregon, on vacation.  It was a clear night. I had noticed that on clear nights I could see the moon set over the ocean from our bedroom window, so I pulled open the shades as I was getting ready to get into bed.  I saw a bright orange, (like fire), round light, which I thought at first was the Coast Guard Helicopter, heading north, towards our house, up the beach.  I called out to my husband to look out the window in the living room, as I watched it coming north, very quickly, then straight out from the house, then continue to head north up the beach.  At that time it seemed like it was actually farther away than I first thought, and as it continued north, it faded away, similar to the way a satellite does.  The light traveled from south when I noticed it, to the north when I saw it fade away, in a total of about two or three minutes. Just then I saw another one coming again from the south and heading north on the same path as the first one.  I again called out to my husband to look.  He turned out the lights in the living room and stepped out onto the deck, with the binoculars, to watch it, and I followed, trying to get my camera turned on and the lens cover off.  The second one was just as fast as the first, followed the same path, and there was no sound that we could hear over the waves of the ocean.  There were no flashing lights, only the one bright orange light that appeared to be all around, as it was not like a head light or tail light.  My husband said it looked like the fire from a hot air balloon through the binoculars. As we watched, the second one disappeared just as the first one had, and then a third one followed.  I could never get one in my site with my camera, and no more came after that, that we know of. We reported our sighting the next day at the Coast Guard station in Depot Bay, but they did not know what it could have been and suggested that perhaps it was the after-burner of a jet.  That would not have been possible as far as we could tell, because it was not at the tail of something.  The whole thing appeared to be at light or a fireball, not a front or head light, or a tail light or engine fire. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

She said she couldn’t look because she did not have her contacts in so she went back to sleep and I went back to the window.

I th! ought that this was where the tiny meteors were falling to but when I really focused on the lights I noticed that they were all repeating their patterns.  As the lights got further away, the jet noise seemed to get softer and eventually was gone as the lights were not visible anymore.

Within a minute or so, this sequential display repeated.   A minute or so later, a second light display began at the more southerly site, and also repeated itself.  This site appeared to me to be just North of Cerro Pelon in the Tumacacoris.   Until 8:10, I saw no more sequential light displays, and went inside to search Phoenix Lights on the Internet. About 8:40 I returned outside, and at 8:42, at the more southerly site, saw a huge chevron shaped structure with at least three amber lights defining it appear and then slowly rotate its point upward during about 5-7 seconds, and then vanish.   A low flying plane or helicopter then headed rapidly southward at low altitude along the Santa Cruz River, skirting the entire Tumacacori Highlands from far northern end to southern end.  At 8:44, a very bright white light/shooting star like object dropped from the sky near the more northerly site, but from higher altitude, falling vertically and not across the sky like shooting stars normally travel.   At 8:45, a single amber light appeared at the more northerly site.    At 8:52, two sequential displays of amber lights occurred in a short time frame at the southerly site.   At 9:07, two sequential displays of amber lights occurred within a short time frame at the northerly site. Prior to noting the single and/or double bright amber lights on the horizon by 7:30 pm MST, I had already noted what I presume to be a military helicopter sitting in position high over the central Tumacacori Highlands.  It is not unusual to see such helicopters here in the Borderlands every night, but what was peculiar was the exceptionally high altitude of this helicopter.   As the amber light display started and continued, the helicopter (with its flashing white, red, and green lights) slowly moved NW towards where the southerly display occurred, and then seemed to hover well above it.   The helicopter disappeared behind (West of) the Tumacacoris at about 9:15 pm MST. Weather conditions here this evening were cloudless, winds were reported as calm at reporting stations in Amado and Tumacacori, and the humidity was about 70-75%.   The display started after the moon had risen, and the light from the harvest moon was exceptionally bright. In sum, I believe I witnessed at least two large UFOs some miles apart, at two distinct sites, each lighting with 6 to 7 bright amber lights in a perfect line.   At the more southerly site, I also once witnessed what appeared to be a chevron as it moved through three dimensions, and I am not sure if that UFO is the same object that appeared to be a line at the southerly site, or a third distinct UFO. To speculate, because of the unusually perfect atmospheric conditions, and because of what I believe was a military helicopter overhead before the display began and apparently tracking it, I would surmise that the military was conducting some secret low altitude tracking or communication experiments.  The moonlight might allow them easier observation/recovery, and the good atmospheric conditions might minimize extraneous perturbations.

I was parked facing south on the west shoulder of 1000 Bowman Springs Rd. in Kennedale, Texas at 0223.   I noticed what first appeared to be a very bright flickering star to the east at about 45 degrees on the horizon.  Then I thought it might be a plane. I noticed it move slowly to the left then stop.  I took my binoculars from my bag and looked at the object.  It was then I could see that what appeared to be flickering were rotating white, blue and sometimes red lights.  The object appeared saucer-like in shape and made no noise.  It would hover, then move left, right and up several times during the duration which lasted 33 minutes. A jet came into the frame also.  I could tell the jet because of the shape, the lights and the headlight out in front.  As the jet approached, the object moved away to the left. When the jet passed, the object moved back. There was a bare tree branch in the foreground I used as a reference point, and could clearly see the object move.  At times it became bigger and one other time it moved straight away until barely visible, then came back to where it had been, but bigger.  The object seemed to have one bigger, central or top light, with the other lights going around it.   I watched this object move around until a low cloud covered it completely from view. When the cloud cover cleared, the object was gone. It WAS NOT a star! It was a full moon with the moon in the west sky.  I was hoping someone else would come by so I could show them.  I tried video on my phone, but it is no good. I would be interested to know if someone else saw this. It could have been seen by nearby Mansfield or Arlington as well probably.

Yesterday, September 24, 2010, I went to my store to work and left in the evening around 7:40 to 7:45 PM.  I had not been drinking and I do not use drugs, prescription or otherwise.  I was with my business partner when I left the store.  My store is located in the center of town near Dock Square.  Our car was parked about two blocks away on Main Street.  It was a clear night and quite dark.  The moon had risen but was a bit obscured by low mist in the sky.  It was very clear overhead.  That part of Main Street is quite dark as it’s residential. When we were almost back to the car, we spotted something moving across the sky.  We were facing north.  The object came out of the southeast and headed north or northwest.  I would say that I was looking up at about a 75 degree angle as it passed overhead.  The object was moving somewhat slowly.  At the center of it was an orange glow, medium bright in intensity.  The glow flickered.  It seemed to me to be more like the flicker of a candle or a fire than what I might describe as pulsating.  The flicker seemed irregular and not like a pulse.  I could see the orange light reflecting on a part of the object that was above the source of light and could not see any part of the object that was above that.  I was not just looking at a “ball of light” or at a light source.  There was a definite apparatus surrounding the light source.  My first impression was that I was looking at a home built ultra light, but there was no sound from it whatsoever.  The object moved above us and con! tinued on toward the northwest until it was just a speck in the distance.  At that point I was observing it at perhaps a 30 to 40 degree angle.  While it was closest to us, I would say that it appeared about half the size of the full moon, maybe a bit bigger.  The light did not streak in any way. I was then very surprised to see another one just like it.  The path, appearance and behavior were exactly the same as the first one.  Within a minute or two we had seen about eight of the objects.  They were not evenly spaced in time or in space but clustered at random, always one behind the other in a follow the leader formation.  Some went by one at a time.  I thought again that I must be looking at ultra lights and that it was perhaps an event put on by a flying club but it seemed odd to me that they would fly at night.  I wondered if they were related in some way to hot air balloons but there was no balloon.  I have been up in a hot air balloon and I know the pattern of the occasional hot flame blast the this was not like that at all.  And hot air balloon blasts illuminate the balloon above the basket.  There was nothing but dark above the light source.  There was also only the faintest breeze (at street level) but the objects were moving along at a faster pace than the! breeze would indicate.  And, as I mentioned, they were silent.  Also, I would say that the path that this “parade” of objects followed did not appear to be a straight line but more of a long curving arc (but that may have been an illusion from my vantage point). We watched the objects move overhead for about fifteen to twenty minutes.  Each time we thought the event was over, we would spot another one or another pair coming out of the southeast and toward us.  I didn’t count the objects because, at the beginning I didn’t know there would be more than the first few.  But I believe that in all there were at least 25 of them and no more than 30 or 32 of them.  No one of them appeared or behaved any differently from the others.  I have no idea if the first one we spotted was the first one to pass overhead.  This might have been going on for a while before we got there. My impression was that I was looking at something “low tech”.  There were no unexplainable motions or rapid changes in direction.  They just drifted overhead as if floating on a steady but strong wind current.  This may have seemed this way to me because of the complete lack of any sound coming from them. Finally, when we were convinced that no more were going to come, we got into the car and drove around the block to drive in front of our store.  We saw three women on the sidewalk (this is the commercial part of town near Dock Square) who looked to be in their late fifties or early sixties.  They were pointing up into the sky in the same direction and at the same angle as I had seen the flying objects.  My partner stopped and let me out of the car so I could ask our employees (the store was still open) if they new of any event.  None of them knew anything.  One of them told me that the Bush family (George W.?) is in town this week but the pattern of what we saw made no sense to me as a security event.  I wish I had spoken to the three women first because when I came out of the store, they were gone.  It was moderately busy in the square and no one else was looking up, but there were no more flying objects at that time. Out of curiosity, my partner called someone at the Biddeford air field, a small strip for private planes just a few miles north of Kennebunkport.  They knew nothing of any event and no one else had reported seeing anything unusual.  I remember looking at my watch when we left Kennebunkport.  It was 8:58 PM.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,43.4183,-70.4984

It was traveling in a fairly straight line horizontally to the ocean at about 30 degrees flying north to south. The light on the aircraft was a bright yellow and the vapor trail was the same color.  I lowered my widow to be sure that what I was seeing wasn’t a reflection on the window.  Certain it was a jet I turned the car off and expected to here the sound of a thundering engine but it was completely quiet.  As it passed midpoint the light began to fade very similarly to how I’ve seen  satellite fades in the passed so I re assessed it as possibly a satellite reflecting the sun but about two seconds after it faded the light flared up again with what appeared to be a puff of smoke and  slowed down considerably.  The sky was relatively clear however the puff of smoke could have been ! a small cloud that simply wasn’t visible prior to the flare up.

I have seen one strange object back in the 90’s but it would be very difficult to describe and so I won’t even bother.  But last night I was surprised at my father’s home on his back deck. The sun was very low on the western horizon and may have even slipped behind the hills. I saw a very bright light in the western sky - I could not make out any fuselage or wings or blinking lights or contrail, but I did quickly decide it was reflecting the sunlight because it changed to a sharper metallic brightness and then the light was gone. The object had moved beyond the reach of the sun’s rays as it traveled in a southeastern direction. I watched this object with some difficulty because it was a faint white, cigar in shape, but not clearly defined.  It was nearly invisible in the pale sky, but I continued to watch the course of it until it finally just faded altogether.  It seemed to be sailing along very smoothly without any wobbles or directional changes. I cannot tell how fast it was traveling, but it covered about 130 degrees of the dome of the sky in 25 - 30 seconds.  I think it was very high in the air but I cannot substantiate that opinion.  It seemed to gain altitude as it traveled west to southeast because it became so faint and hard to distinguish.

All you could see were the white and blue blinking lights zooming across the sky toward the south.  Suddenly witness 1 shouts “Oh my god do you see that!” and grabs my arm. At that moment I noticed an object moving across the sky toward the south at about a 65 degree angle from the plane. I froze and we just watched it go across the sky till it disappeared over the horizon, maybe 3-4 seconds. The object was a mere shadow in the sky, I believe the best way to describe it would be similar to the sci-fi invisibility suits that mirror the image or scene behind itself, but the mirrored image is bent or slightly distorted. The object was not obvious in any way, you would have only seen it if you were focusing in that area of the sky.  The object was shaped like a boomerang and I could see faint, no brighter than a dull s! tar, red lights lining the front of it (the angled or bent portion of the object).  The lights did not blink and they all appeared exactly the same.  As the object moved across the sky it did not change altitude, course, or speed.  The object was closer to us than the plane and moved at a slower speed relative to the plane. However, the object did move at a good speed, I noticed the object when it was directly above me and watched it to the horizon in about 4 seconds. From where I stood, the object appeared to be about the size of a football field so I figure it must have been even larger when considering distance. I never heard a sound from either plane, and my two dogs did not appear to notice/hear anything. At first I thought I was hallucinating until witness 1 said “No, didn’t you see the red lights?”  At that point we had not said anything regarding what the object looked like. We immediately went inside to draw, independently, what we had seen before discussing it wit! h each other.  Our pictures were the same. Background: I am a full time student at Texas State University-San Marcos. I will complete my BS in Biology this May 2011. I have a minor in psychology which has already been completed. I am a very scientifically oriented person and have never taken UFO sightings very seriously before. I tried to rationalize what I saw in every way possible, but still returned to the conclusion that it was alien to this world. I thought maybe a giant flock of birds- no flock flies in such a perfect shape or carries red flashlights; maybe a military plane like the stealth bomber- there are no nearby military bases and I don’t see the point of designing such a big aircraft to fly stealth (it would be detected by radar at such a large size); so maybe what I saw was an unconscious inference (some of our perceptions are the result of unconscious assumptions we make about the environment) and was really just some planes flying in a chevron shape way up leaving contrails- I have never seen an aircr! aft that has only one steady red light (which would be the case if there was more than one plane) and the rest of the object did not look anything like contrails.  Witness 1: Witness 2 and I were on the back porch enjoying at the nice night. We saw a plane passing overhead and then all of a sudden I spotted something out of one’s imagination, a shape in the sky that looked like an oversized boomerang.  This ship-like object almost looked like a stealth bomber without the sharp angles, but ten times the size.  It cruised across the sky a little slower than the plane and really high up. It had small red lights like faint stars on the very front of the shape. This shape was the same color as the night sky; it was like a ripple moving across the sky. The way it moved was like nothing ever, it made no noise. Background: I graduated from Texas State University in 2009 with a BESS in health and fitness administration and a minor in business. I am the administrator of a podiatrist office/specialized running store in New Braunfels, TX.  My father is a Ranger, so I have spent a good majority of my life living on military bases and seeing the jets fly by. This was not like anything I have ever seen on any military base!

The object was observed against a ship light for reference to make sure the object was moving; also the star before the big dipper juts-up the star which is not part of the big dipper in the handle was also used for reference.  The object proceeded to move north past the ship light see Ref #3 which the ship light for the whole time to this period was fixed; after the object moved to the right of the very bright ship light the ship started moving due south ref #4.  At this time I cut a hole into a piece of paper and secured it placing my face at least 6 inches away from the hole to double check to see again if it was my eyes playing tricks, but the object was moving as mentioned above moving out of the range of the cutout.  One note at no time did the object move north of the last star in the handle of the big dipper as if it was a boundary.  Also the object seemed to move west at one time to chase a very faint light south to north moving like a strobe on a aircraft which one could barely make out the light it was so dim.  You almost had to catch it out of the corner of your eye.

All the sudden I saw what looked like a bright light about 1000-2000 feet above me. I had not seen where it came from.  After a minute it was joined by 2 more bright objects. I tried to look at them to see if they were gulls, or something else.  They did not move in the pattern a gull would.  I also thought about balloons, but again they do not move the way these did, no floating etc, these moved in deliberate movement. First 1 light, then being joined by another and just sitting still, no movement. After a couple of minutes of watching the 3 bright lights, all the sudden there were at least 13-15 or more of the objects. Then they began to form triangles some were standard all the same length triangles an then some were much longer and the end lights were closer together forming an elongated triangle.  I watched them come together, move apart, form patterns of triangles and then just move back and sit there. There was one light, and then it was being joined by another and just sitting still, no movement. Then they began moving to form triangles and groups of 3-7 objects in a circle pattern. I was getting ready to go back to work and one of the managers of the place I work came by, I asked him if he could see anything, he said “ no “ and I said come over to where I am standing, and he did and then he said “ Yes I can see something “ I said “ What is it?” and he said “ its not planes, and it’s not birds and I don’t know what they are, but if I had a gun, I would shoot at them”  Just what I needed a trigger happy witness.  So that was when they disappeared. I have a Canon 12x SX 200 IS camera and I did take a couple of pictures but the sun was so bright and it was hard to see anything through the lens.  I have been trying to see if I can find some photo enhancing software to look at the pictures. There is obviously something there in the pictures. So when the objects disappeared, I made a note of the time and went back to work. I did not hear of anyone else seeing them and I did not see them later when I went outside.

Happened to be looking up at the right time.   It was warm and clear, maybe hi 60's and we (husband and I, (I'm a homemaker) were showing our son the big dipper constellation.  We were all looking up in that general direction for about one minute, when I saw it. I'd like to note that there is a sort of lighthouse style arm or ray of light, very faint that rotates over the apartment complex that we live in.  I'm not sure of its source.  But it's always there night after night, probably/maybe from a local building.  The arm of light is such that if the cloud cover is low, the light seems to skim the bottom of the clouds.  The light makes a full rotation about every 7 seconds.  I just went outside (it's now 23:20) to time it and it wasn't on.  So not sure what that is about.  I'm not outside this late very often. I was looking up and following the faint pale search light with my eyes as it was skimming the sky (right above my head, I was looking straight up)  when in the lights path was a chevron shape of lights ( it reminded me of those black military stealth bomber planes in the shape of it.)  The sighting lasted about 5 seconds and it seemed to be smoothly flying across the sky heading from east to west.  The lights were tiny and a faint yellow/white color.  The stars making up the big dipper were brighter and bolder.  It's hard to recall but maybe there were 10 or fewer lights.  As it traveled away from me it was even harder to keep my eyes on it (the lights bordering the shape got less intense as it flew away)  and about 5 seconds later it seemed to disapear into the blackness of the night sky.  I couldn't follow it as far as I could follow an airplane in the night sky.  I'd like to note that it made NO SOUND.  I was excitely trying to direct my husband to see it, but, like I sa! id the event was so quick and had my eye been still looking at the big dipper itself, I'm pretty sure I would have never caught a glimpse of it .",2010-11-21T00:00:00,46.632617886178856,-120.56871761517615

From my vantage point it appeared to be over long island. What struck me about the light was the brightness especially considering we have a storm blowing through tonight. I was surprised to see this light through the thick clouds that were blowing over. Other stars would get covered over but this light would shine right through the clouds. After I noticed it and really started taking a look at it, I could see lines of light coming from the source that could be described as tentacles or lightning bolt shaped. I thought those lines could have been a trick on my eyes but I blinked and changed perspective and the lines coming from the light stayed clear.  After getting very interested, I got my camera to film it. Unfortunately after that I was not able to see the light at it's full brightness and my camera had a hard time picking it up. By the naked eye, I could still see those lines coming from the light. It seemed very weired that I could see them as the clouds were still blowing through.  The light wasn't moving with the same pattern as the stars. When I first noticed it and started observing, the light moved but I didn't have a good position marked to figure out how far. It wasn't fast though and certainly didn't go shooting off in any direction. When I went in to get my camera and came out, the light was in a much different place but still generally in the same area being south east of my vantage point.  I tried to get photographic evidence of the light and set myself in a position I could remember with trees in the foreground. Although I was able to capture the light on my camera, I don't think it will be very useful because it is so dark out tonight and at that point the light seemed to be aimed somewhere else and thusly was not as bright.  Things that were striking about this light are: * The color of the light was not at all like the stars or the planes flying over. I'd describe it as an LED light while the stars were incandescent. There was a blue color in the light, it seemed. * The pattern the light moved in reminded me of a search pattern but the source was far too high for that to be the case. * The striations coming from the light were truly bizarre. It was like seeing the source of multiple lightning bolts coming from a single source but lasting for minutes at a time. When the light was dim, I could still make out the lines but they weren't as easy to identify. It seemed that every time the light shone bright, the striations were the same configuration however. * Although it wasn't immediately obvious, the light was moving. The pattern it was moving in was more like it was making observations of an area and then move on. I never saw it shoot off in one direction or another but it would either slowly move while it was bright or go dim and then be bright in another spot that was maybe 5 or 10 degrees off from it's last spot.  I have not pulled the camera video onto my computer yet but would be willing to post it onto a server for you to observe. Please email me for that information. Also please understand that I do travel for as long as a week at a time so please be patient if I do not respond right away.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,41.3022,-73.3883

I will describe this event so it becomes part of the historical record of such events which occur and might be explained if other people also observed it or know of events or occurrences which can identify or explain it. My home is located in the town Burlington, WI some on Bushnell Road.  My lot is about 3 acres in size and has treed and open areas, along with my house and three other outbuildings.  From many places of my lot, I have excellent visibility of the sky in all directions.  I can easily get to all of my lot from any of my structures in just a few seconds. I returned home from work approximately 6:30-6:45 PM and entered my detached garage with my automobile.  Immediately, after entry, I let 2 of my dogs out of their kennels to get their evening run and spend time with them.  After about 15 minutes I returned them to their kennels in the garage and gathered items from my automobile and garage to bring them into my house.  I entered my house through the attached garage service door and put my items down on the stair landing in the garage.  I then let out my pup from his kennel in the attached garage to have his run as well.  Again after abut 10-15 minutes, I returned him to his kennel and then I brought my things into the house. Knowing I had to look for something in my detached garage, I returned to it and quickly found what I needed and set it aside to use later.  It was approximately 7:00-7:15 PM as near as I can estimate since I did not look at my wristwatch at that time.  When I left the service door in my detached garage I happened to look up in the western sky.  I observed a red and white flashing light and figured I had seen an airplane and this was through the trees.  However. I did not see it emerge from the trees and so I kept watching the sky above the tree as I was walking to my house.  Suddenly, I saw the same light phenomenon as I reached a point when I could see a large expanse of the western sky. This flashing light group appeared to have red and white flashing lights some short distance apart on both sides of what I will describe as a horizontal access.  It also had white flashing lights at either end of a vertical access.  My cartoon of this description is attached.  At first I thought this was simply an airplane heading approximately NW according to my position of observation.  Suddenly, this thing stopped moving and seemed to hold its position in the sky.  I continued walking westward and cleared any trees and other high obstructions to my view of the westward sky.  I was in my neighbor's yard at this time. This thing made horizontal tracks in the sky in each horizontal direction.  I will designate this as right and left directional movement.  It moved at least 10 of its lateral width's to the right, back to its original position and then at least 10 of its lateral widths to the left and then back to its original position.  It could move quickly ~ 1 second for the complete right or left directions or very slowly ~ 10 seconds for the same movement.  It could also do this vertically, which I would designate in the up and down directions.  I watched this for about 15 minutes.  Then this thing seemed to fly off in a NW direction and stop again.  I watched it do the same maneuvers and started scanning the skies to the north, west and south which were visible from my position. To my surprise, I saw several of these objects in the sky!  They were all doing similar maneuvers and as I counted them, I was sure I counted approximately 8 to 10 of these things.  The were positioned from the southeast to the northwest from what I was able to discern.  All of them were able to make the same movements as I previously described. I was moderately excited to have observed these things and I went inside my home about 8:15 PM to rest and recall what I had seen.  As I said, I have no idea what these things are and I first thought maybe the military has a new flying object and was testing here in Wisconsin.  Also, could these things just have been air traffic in some kind of holding pattern for Chicago/O'Hare or Milwaukee/Mitchell airports.  I heard no sounds coming from these things as well but I will also state, these were quite high up in the sky and maybe inaudible to me.  I cannot think of any other information to put into this short report.  Below is a stylized layout of the flashing lights I saw on that night. Below is a sketch of what I saw in the sky, which are the flashing light positions.  The crossed lines are for my reference to draw the ""thing"" to some degree of scale as I can remember.  If there is an explanation, please let me know what it is.  Thank you.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,42.6496,-88.2985

Its east to west path would have been approximately 43° 19' 11"" N / 87° 57' 11"" W. Determining its elevation would be difficult but it was low enough to either reflect ground-based city light from its faceted edges or it was glowing a ghostly, almost mist-like ""low wattage"" line of bulbs the edge of the wings. The color of the light was a golden white. It was almost like watching a perfectly triangular shaped flock of white seagulls although there was no sound, no wing flapping and all were perfectly aligned like they were coasting in unison with wings outstretched. The shape of the bowtie-shaped facets were illuminated by something akin to the tiny bulb used in a nightlight which is about 7 watts. Birds would not have been 1) Silent, 2) Able to coast ! in perfect unison, and 3)have identical wing markings. I have reasonably ruled out birds flying in unison.  The object has been observed now three times each time moving from west to east around 9-10pm (21.00-22.00) Each time it appears to have a misty or foggy glow in light just barely brighter than a distant starlight. The first two observations I believed were due to some kind of reflection of a streetlight in my contact lens. Tonight, however, I saw it for about a full 7 seconds and watched it move across a greater portion of the sky overhead. Note that the city of Milwaukee is about 18 miles due south of the observed location which may have been the source of reflected light on the delta shape.  As someone who has traveled by air for over 30 years, I know aircraft pretty well. As a salesman to the U. S. military, I have been on bases around the U. S. and in Europe and have never seen anything resembling this object. I listened very carefully for sound trailing the path of the object but there was none. Once it reached a point about 40 degrees above the eastern horizon, it appeared to go black or it simply disappeared. As it disappeared the other two times I have observed it, too, it might be that its facets no longer reflect light back to the ground beyond a certain observed angle.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,43.3297,-87.9294

About 36 hours ago, I was standing out in my front yard of my new farm.  I was reading ""The Old Farmers Almanac"" and it said to look in the southern sky at nite to get a fantastic view of the planet Jupiter, as it is the brightest lite in the sky at this time of this year.  I stood and easily found it.  I called my wife outside to look at it.  We admired the bright planet for a few minutes and went back inside. Later that nite at about 10:30-11:00 pm., I went outside to investigate what I thought were some dangerously close coyotees, (I have 2 dogs and 3 cats).  When realizing that there was no apparent danger I looked up again to take another look at Jupiter when I noticed a rather quick moving light going across the sky heading in a straight line (north-by-northeast I would say). Normally, I would think nothing of it as Atlanta is a huge airway and we occassionally see aircraft in the area. However,  this light (as I pointed out to my wife), had no signal lights or other identifying features.  It was moving too quickly to be a satelight (as I have seen them before).  It didn't look like a shooting star as it was moving to slow for that.  It also had no tail. The best way I and my wife can discribe it is a far off light moving quickly from horizon to horizon in a staight line much like an aircraft would do, but without any other tell-tale blinking lights.

The reason I’m reporting this is because it was so strange and there were multiple witnesses that must have seen this plane hovering over the JI Connector. I was driving over the James Island connect from West Ashley towards Folly beach.  The time was exactly 8:12pm October 1st/2010.  There was a ton of traffic going to and from James Island tonight. As I’m driving I notice to my left a V shaped plane/helicopter with small white lights going down the sides of the V, there was one light at the tip of the V and then probably 4 or 5 smaller lights which pointed down the left and right side of the V.   In the middle of the V was a single blinking white light which blinked much like a normal airplane light except instead of the light being on the two tips of the wings, this blinking light was in the middle of this V.  The shape was very similar to a military stealth bomber; that was my fight thought.  Normally I would say ""damn that’s a weird airplane/helicopter"" and keep driving; however this V shaped plane/helicopter was literally  hovering  over the JI connector.  It was completely stagnate, it was as if it was motionless, hovering literally over what must have been 50 to 60 cars going to and from, over the JI connector.   It was so odd and so silent and completely motionless.  Looking back, I keep thinking no commercial or private plane would be able to fly so close over a US HWY.  Maybe it was some type of balloon; yet it seem to have mass and a such an unusual patter of lights.  I don’t know what this was but I know for a fact many people saw this.

I often run at night on this track and almost always see aircraft heading toward the airport during my run.  I am familiar with the typical flight path of planes on their way to Lambert.  What I saw tonight was a clear outline/silhouette of the wings of what looked like a typical jet headed for landing but it was lower (in altitude) and was traveling a little faster than the planes I usually see when running at this track.  I could make out the wings quite clearly but the tail and nose (assuming they were there) of the craft were less clear.

We have two side windows running the length of the door on either side.  I saw a slightly larger than beach ball sized white object coming toward our house from the road, which is about 200 yards.  The color of the object was a bright white, which was what originally caught my attention, and travelling fast, about 6 – 8 inches above the ground.  It appeared somewhat transparent.  When it was about 30 yards from our house, it shot off to the left toward our driveway and the woods beyond.  As it changed directions, it changed from being a sphere-like shape to an elongated shape, almost like an oval.  During the time it travelled from the road toward our house, my eyes didn’t leave the object.  I walked down the hall toward the side window watching its approach.  By the time I reached the front door, it shot off ! to the left.  I opened the front door, still perplexed by what I’d seen, and walked outside.  I looked to the left and to the right trying to figure out what it was.  I saw nothing.  I walked down the front sidewalk toward our side entry garage in the direction it had gone and there was nothing there.  It had simply disappeared.   I thought maybe it was an empty plastic garbage bag that had been caught in the wind and was blowing back toward our house, but that was not what it appeared to be or looked like.  And if it had been a plastic bag, I would’ve seen it either caught up against one of the 3 fence lines on that side of the house or caught in the tall weeds and grass at the edge of the woods.  There was not enough time for a bag to simply disappear the way this object had.    I said to my wife when I first saw it ‘I just saw a glowing white ball of light’ coming down the yard, which was my first and initial impression.  My wife and I immediately walked to the back of t! he house and out into the back yard to get a better view of th! e wooded area behind our house and again, there was simply nothing.   I have no idea if this description of my experience is at all similar to any other ufo sightings, but it is the only explanation we can come up with.  It was a gloomy, gray day with no sun shining at all at that time.  There were no cars passing by on the road.  We couldn’t think of anything at all that could’ve caused what I witnessed.

We had plenty of bright daylight which made this seem kind of odd. We live just 35 miles west of Atlanta, Ga. we see lots of aircraft from the airport and we are amazed at the number of flights coming in most days. This was most assuredly NOT a plane or even a single craft. The sky was very clear and I don’t recall a cloud in sight. I glanced upward kind of in a southern direction and saw what I thought at first was a star and immediately realized it was not a star as my understanding is that stars twinkle so then I thought a planet and it must be Jupiter since it had been in the news that it was very close. Keep in mind these thoughts flooded my mind in just a couple of seconds. As I was processing what I was seeing I realized that I could see a cluster and to my amazement  a geometric shape took place and I was really not believing my eyes at this point. The shape “connecting the dots” so to speak would have been a six pointed star. All of the other “Fire balls” were somewhat inside of the main area. I had a tough time with the count because at least two of them seemed to be interacting or moving very closely together this movement was very obvious to me but all the others either had no movement or it was undetectable. Also most of the “fire balls” were yellow but several of them maybe four or five were red or orange in color but had the same shape and size as well as amount of light intensity. It became harder to see the objects as time went so I would say the faded rather than moved in a horizontal direction. But the main star outline remained the entire time. My wife came over to where I was standing and said she could see about five of them. I went in to get my camera and when I returned I had a hard time getting my eyes to focus at first but I did see them again but my photo did not show what I had hoped and so I have no other evidence. I would like to add that if this had happened at night it may well have went unnoticed to the untrained eye, namely me. We know we saw something but as to what we could not really say.

When i looked at the sky i saw what looked like 3 bright red stars forming a triangle like image - hovering in the air above the horizon to our west. Similar to the following: .   . We were looking to the west from our West Rand suburb - just North West of Johannesburg, South Africa. The lights moved slightly upward, then one of them moved very slight lower and the over very slightly to the right.   Then all three of them faded out - one by one. Not all at the same time.  They did not move fast left, right or up - they just faded into darkness. I thought they could be flares, but who would light 3 flares at the same time?? The only conclusion i can reach after reading up on UFOs on the internet is that this must have been a UFO sighting.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,,

On clear nights I try to spot satellites and track them as far as I can (a habit I had since I was a kid).  On this night, I spotted what looked like a typical fuzzy blueish satellite traveling slowly accross the center of the sky from south to north.  As the light headed north it grew brighter then ""flared"" into a very bright diamond shape for about 5 seconds.  Then, the light dimmed as it traveled and returned to the fuzzy dot and continued on it's path. Theres a large, very bright star/planet in the southern sky at that time of night and I would say the brightness was the same. I had the impression of something entering our atmosphere for a moment, then leaving on the same path since it never burned out like a shooting star.  At no point did the light change speed or it's trajectory. I would also like to mention that I saw something similar to the Bloomington report on 5/11/10.  However, I thought it was closer to 10pm.  I'm not sure what the person is referring to as the ""right"" side of the sky, but what I saw was red/orange light travelling slightly southwest direction.  It was moving about the same speed of a commercial jet, however it was single bright light with no strobes that you would expect to see on a jet.  There was no sound, however it came to an almost immediate stop directly above, faded, then disappeared.  I would even describe the fading as if the object rose directly up as it disappeared because it grew smaller as it faded.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,40.47267919621749,-88.95847375886524

I was in the back parking lot of an apartment complex in a south-western Birmingham suburb, near the top of the tallest hill in the area (which slopes northwards,) stargazing.  No one was about and there was little to no air traffic at that time.  It was a moonless night I was watching Taurus rise in the eastern sky.  Out of the corner of my eye and towards my left field of vision, I noticed a large optical blur- like a wave effect- directly over the constellation Cassiopeia.  A triangular or, perhaps, wide wedge shaped object seemed to materialize into existence at that point against the star field.  The exact shape was difficult to ascertain, because my eyes were dazzled by an absolute matte blackness which seemed to cloak the thing and travel with it, and was profound and visually confounding; but I was able to discern that it was roughly triangular in shape. Each of its three blunt or rounded corners was steadily illuminated, but these stripes of luminosity did not seem mechanical.  Rather, they appeared dim and phosphorescent, of a sickly yellow-green hue, reminiscent of a weak glow-stick. The object first appeared roughly 50- 60 degrees above the horizon, north-north-east, at an altitude of approximately 300- 400 feet, headed due south, skirted the Pleiades to the west, and passed almost over my head and behind the top of the hill.  Its initial flight-path was slow and deliberate, like a helicopter or a glider.  It could not have been either one of these vehicles, though, because it was absolutely silent and was traveling almost against the wind.  It was much too slow for a prop plane or, especially, a jet.  I will reiterate: the thing was silent as death.  I estimate its diameter (point to point) to have been about 20- 30 feet.  This first sighting lasted 8- 10 seconds. It is perhaps irrelevant, but noteworthy, that within 10 seconds after this sighting I witnessed a brilliant white falling star in the east, very near on the horizon, directly behind what was the object’s flight- path. About three minutes later, it (I assume it was the same object) proceeded back the way it came- this time at a much higher altitude and at an impossibly high speed.  Had I not still been scrutinizing the sky, or had I even blinked, I would have missed it.  This second time it was only recognizable as a distant black point of mass that blanked out the highest stars as it passed.  Any object traveling at that speed should have (according to my understanding of Newtonian physics) produced a sonic boom, but it was, again, completely silent. I will add a final, perhaps irrelevant, detail.  For sake of a complete record I state here that I have never in my life felt such a prescient sense of dread and malevolence as I did while witnessing this object and after the fact.  I soon departed the area.  Since that time, I have been plagued with vicious nightmares and a disrupted sleeping pattern.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,33.48091579651941,-86.77946934404284

My first instinct was that it was an aircraft because it was close to a small airport.   However, then more lights appeared, at the same elevation, all equadistant from eachother, a total of eleven lights, almost like what you would see on a sign where one appears and then more come on from the center.  Once all the light were on, they all disappeared.   So immediately, I just dismissed it as maybe a reflection of some kind.  Then, it happened again, the very same thing and at the same elevation.   I knew then that it must be something.   It happened again and you could see by the illumination of the lights, it was turning to my right.   My first and second sighting was from broadside.  The I say one more glimpse of it as it constinued to turn and then nothing.   I talked to a friend of mine and they said they had saw it too, however in the past, not this time.  Not sure those sightings were reported. I have never discounted the fact that there could be this type of thing but have never experienced it. I am retired Air Force and have viewed many strange lights before which could always be explained and factually proven to be aircraft, sometimes due to clouds and different type of aircraft.  However, this was no aircraft and could not of been a group of aircraft unless they were helicopters practicing a syncronised light show, even that, there were no collision lights observed and they were too close together I would think and too much of a straight line to be that.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,31.8176,-99.4701

It was in view for 5-10 seconds.  There was no sound. I tried to rationalize it thinking it was perhaps a large bird and that some lighting was reflecting off the front edge of the wings.  The more I thought about it, I couldn’t think of a bird in our area large enough to glide by with this effect.  The herons & egrets in the area keep flapping their wings when they fly, so it couldn’t have been one of them since what I saw was a steady movement.  It wasn’t Canadian Geese in formation either.  Also, the object appeared quite large, so if it was a bird and it appeared that large to me, it would’ve been flying very low and I should’ve been able to see the body to some extent. Since I could see no other part of the figure, I assume the object was at a pretty high altitude. If I’m correct in that assumption, then the object was quite large.  After the object disappeared, I extended my arm and with my thumb and forefinger I approximated the size.  The object from tip to tip of the bow (crescent?) was about an inch and a half spread of my thumb and forefinger with my arm extended.

I noticed very bright lights in the East Southeast sky that were unusually bright.  They had the appearance and bright light of a planet but I knew this could not be the case. I am not sure what planet is in the Eastern sky over Texas this time of year, but these two objects were due South of this planet and appeared just as bright.  Almost to the point where you would think there three planets in a small cluster. There were several planes in the sky at the time, so it was easy to distinguish the two objects that I was observing and determine that they were not planes.  Plus, the objects were at a such a far distance that you would not be able to spot a plane that far away. As soon as I got up out of my chair to observe further, the object closest to the South vanished very quickly.  It did not appear to move away quickly, but rather it just faded out very fast. The other object was still shining brightly, just as bright as the planet to the North, and then, it too vanished almost immediately. Although I live very near to an Air Force and observe the flight patterns all of the time, this by no means resembled any of the planes that fly by and these objects were so very, very far in the distance that I do not think a plane could fly that high.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,32.757366003227546,-97.34710441097364

Campbell area for two nights in a row, moving erratically and shining brightly. I am a 40 year old military officer, who had worked for over 10 years in Army Aviation before switching to Military Intelligence.  Regarding this event, my wife and I had just returned from taking the kids to karate practice.  Because my wife had mentioned seeing a strange object in the sky a few weeks ago (over Labor-Day weekend), I went out onto the deck to look at the sky.  Having just returned from overseas duty on R&R leave, I was not home on the night she had seen the strange craft.  Last night however, I quickly noticed a bright star-like object that was much brighter than any other star in the sky, and (assuming it was Venus or something) watched it for a few moments - not that I have any idea where Venus would normally be located.  The object I was looking at was located to the WNW, seeming to be over or near Ft. Campbell (approximately 10 miles away).   Just before I was about to turn around and go in, it suddenly dropped about a third of the way from where it was in the sky towards the ground, almost dipping below the outline of a tree in my neigbors yard (the neighbor who lives one house over and behind me).  Shocked that I was possibly seeing a real UFO, I yelled for my daughters to come outside.  Both of them came out to see what I was looking at.  The object was moving slowly left and right now, but then darted back up to where it had originally been in the sky.  It moved far faster than any Army Helicopter I have ever seen would be able to, and bobbed around in a manner that was disconcerting to watch.  It seemed wierd.  I would have to guess that it was less than 10,000 feet high, since jetliners in the sky crossed nearby a couple of times and looked much higher.  It looked like a bright star that was alternating between staying there and darting left and right, occassionally swwooping down and up in no discernible pattern.  I finally went and got my daughter's telescope, using it to focus on the object as best! I could (hate it because her tripod is broken).  When I could! get it to stay centered, it was clearly visible as a sphere-like object that was translucent - containing pulsating lights flashing from within the sphere - reddish lights mixed with white flashes.  It was pretty impressive.  I don't know if it was from the telescope or from the object, but the sphere seemed to have some sort of texture to it's surface - like lots of blocks or lines making up it's shape.  My daughter also was able to see it through the telescope.  After a while, we got tired of looking at it and went back inside.  About 30 minutes later, I went to bed... but poked my head out the back door to see if it was still there.  It was, but it was not moving a whole lot now.  Today (the next day) I looked in that area of the sky numerous times throughout the day to see if there was anything there.  No luck.  Tonight, the object is back, but seems much higher and farther away than it did last night.  It is moving also... but not as crazy as it was last night, at least not in! the few minutes I spent watching it.  The pulsating lights on it are fairly obvious though... far brighter than the typical 'twinkling' you get from stars (the Doppler effect).  If it comes closer, I will try to film it with my camcorder.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,36.51515837104073,-87.36103416289593

On October 8th, 2010 at about 12 AM, I was looking at the stars with my 10X50 binoculars in the direction of constellation of Cassiopeia;  I was trying to find the Andromeda galaxy when I viewed an unknown aircraft flying from west to east.  I do not know how high it was.  Because it was dark, it appeared to be oval, but if may have had straight edges like an octagon.  It did not appear to have wings.  It was difficult to tell if it was an oval or an octagon because the color of the object appeared to be a dull red;  I don't know if the color of the underside was because it may have had a matted surface which dully reflected mercury vapor street lamps from below or whether the color of the underside was glowing.   The object had no aviation marker  lights.  I moved swiftly and silently. I did not track it without the binoculars. To the north is the San Gabriel Mountains.  To the west of my house is Los Angeles International Airport; I can see in the distance the landing lights of the planes; depending on weather airliners will pass over my house.  To the east is Ontario International Airport, since I live on a hill and have deck over the my garage I can see airliners with their marker lights on departing Ontario airport.  To the northeast is El Monte Airport.  There was a slight breeze, but not enough to turn the ventilation turbines on the roof of my house.    I do not think that it was a novelty Mylar balloon because the underside of the object was parallel with the ground as it was flying.  I have seen the B-2 bomber in flight during the day and this was not that.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,,

U.F.O Sighting (St. Catharines, Ontario)  The U.F.O Sighting occured on Saturday October 9th  at 1:00 in the morning, Viewed from a park on Russle avenue.  There was only two witnesses, being myself, and another person.  The sighting had occured shortly after a previous sighting (unreported) a few weeks after, at the very same park.  The sighting A few weeks before appeared to be one big white light travelling towards the park (which was bigger than all stars in the sky).  As the light continued to travel overhead, it turned into three lights (all in a triangular formation).  But at no time was I, or the other two witnesses looking away.  As it flew over, it created a slightly noticeable soaring sound (noticeabley quieter than that of a Stealth Fighter Jet) and did not resemble the shape/form of one either.  The three lights appeared to stay white, and did not flash like commercial/military planes. Until the lights slowly faded at different times (NOT flash), to a lighter then darker blue, and then red. The current sighting that I and another saw today, was first noticed by myself when looking into the sky for unusual movement, colour, shape, and size.  I had just been taking a long gaze into the sky to see what I could find, when i noticed something strange about what i was watching.  I noticed how all other stars flickered in the sky and remained in shape/colour (as usual), when one “star” had been changing colours from white, to blue, red, green, and pink.  I and the witness could see the apparition in the sky with the naked eye clearly (without squinting) and decided to use the high quality picture camera/video camera that has a very extensive zoom.  What we saw through the camera was an even clearer image of what I had first seen.  It was a bigger image of a flickering (somewhat like a star) colour changing object in the sky.  Looking at other stars next to this unknown flying object, was clear evidence that what we had been looking at was clearly not a star.  Not any greenho! use gasses or anything reflecting off of whatever the government would try and excuse this for.  The only other thing that this unknown object was doing, was fading out almost as if it was about to disappear and then would come back.

(Philadelphia’s Finest)..working the graveyard shift. So, after reading her text, I was very much awake.  It felt fairly cool out in the living room, that‘s when I realized I must have been pretty tired the night before, because I never forget to close my windows before I go to bed.  As I was closing all the windows, I went to close the second window in my kitchen above my sink, when I noticed this bright light out back between the break in the trees which is ordinarily pitch black especially at 5:00 a.m. When I seen the first light, and I thought to my self what is that?  This light was larger than a star and yellowish orange in color and round. It would get larger and smaller, but staying stationary. Then, another light, much larger in size, same yellowish orange in color and round, became visible to the left of the first light. I could not believe my eyes!  I realized at this time, these are not stars, this is something I have never seen before in my entire life!  This larger light, repeatedly would get very large, then very small and disappear entirely, several times! While the smaller light to the right was staying relatively the same size and remaining at the same location and stationary. I quickly ran to wake up my youngest daughter, she jumped up to my amazement and I quickly took her to the kitchen window. The smaller light was barely visible, but returned to the original size when I first seen it.  The second light was gone, I waited for it to reappear, but it did not.  I got dressed and ran down to my car to take a drive to see if I could get a better glimpse past the trees, but I seen nothing. A short while later, as I was eating my breakfast and was preparing my coffee, I continued to look out the window above my sink.  When the smaller light reappeared. I called for my daughter and her father, to come to the window, my daughter's father who is a true skeptic could not believe his eyes!

On Saturday October 9, 2010 in Gilbert AZ I was outside playing with my five year old nephew when I looked up in the sky to see what appeared to be a star in the sky. It was around 5:38 PM and I thought that this was odd because the sun wasn’t to set till about another 20 minutes at 6:01 and the sky was clear blue with plenty of sunlight.  I thought it might be a planet so I ran inside to get the binoculars. I came back and located it again as it was the only odd light in the sky. When looking through the scope it appeared to be a circular disc-like object that had a weird reddish light mixed with white light around it that appeared to be changing color. It was stationary and did not have the blinking lights of a plane. I then ran inside to get my father and we got another set of binoculars. I couldn’t find the first object that I saw as it had moved. We then saw four distinct lights in the south southeast sky that had the same appearance as the first.  All four of them were stationary without blinking lights of a plane or movement of a satellite. With the naked eye they looked like faint stars in the sky but once again this was very odd as it was blue sky and before the sunset.  When they were magnified with the binoculars we both were able to see circular disc-like objects. I saw the same red and white lights that were around the first one almost like an orb or aura and appeared to change colors. My father only saw white lights when he looked but clearly saw the circular disc shape of the objects as I did. Three of the objects were in a line and the fourth was up and to the right of the other three. The objects stayed in the sky for around five to six minutes and then they were just gone! . I checked my cell and it was 5:45 PM still 16 minutes before sunset.

They also seemed to make no sound at all. While watching the objects we noticed a large white jet travelling south toward us and the objects.

The house is on a corner lot that is 102ft x 87ft.  I have been in this house for over 50 years.  There is a large front porch where I sit to have my ""peace and quiet.""  My husband passed away ((deleted--about a decade ago.)).   We were married 52 ½ years,  We have 6 children, ages 40 to 63 years old and many grand children and great grand children. My porch is well used.  My grandchildren and I would sit for hours talking about the trees, the sky, stars, planets, clouds and the winds.  Yes, we are pretty observant.  I would tell them what I have learned from my grandfather.  When it starts to snow, the porch is closed up. On October 9, 2010, Saturday around 6:30pm, I was sitting in my chair.  I saw clouds moving faster than normal.  On the south side of the house, I noticed the ""misplaced"" North star about 90 degrees from the ground.  I talk quietly to the star, as our loved ones are there.  Between the trees there is an open space like a platform.  As I sit, I don’t see the North star, but I saw a larger star that was glittering.  As I got up to walk to the banister of the porch, something on the south side naturally got my attention.  A ""star"" darted east to west  slowly.  Then it moved faster.  I was able to see this incident very clearly.   I went into the house and told my daughter and grandson, but of course the computer was important to them.  I grabbed my binoculars and went back by the banister on the south side.  I looked up and it looked like pretty glares.  It looked like an oblong box with 2 long lines and 2 shorter lines, with a big star and two or more stars that were not as big.  The big star was glowing and bouncing side to side.  The line on the big star was in the center of the top line.  It looked like a large picture frame.  The lines were darting here and there, inside the oblong shape, they zig-zagged back and forth, up and down as if a hand was waving or writing something.  This lasted for 21 minutes.  The whole area had a glow.  An airplane came from Midway Airport, heading west, the stars were to the east.  I turned to look at the airplane, and when I looked back at the stars they were gone, but the glow was still there. It had looked like the lights in Vegas, it was very pretty and eye catching, yet I was scared.  I never really believed in flying saucers, but now I believe in the stars...objects.  I hope this is a good omen. My thoughts are... The oceans control almost everything, making more movement like tidal waves, hurricanes, etc.  Just about a pattern of towns and area, floods, damage and death.  The sun comes up from the east, over the house to the south for years.  For the last two years, the sun rises from the east over my neighbors house (north) and our backyard.  Now, Oct/Nov, the sun is over more south of my house.  The weather in Illinois is alike in the Spring and the Fall.  In the so called true Autumn, leaves fall, of course the winds and storms help the tree leaves fall. November, 11 2010: The fall/Autumn colors are not like years before, the trees are so colorful.  Many trees still have their leaves.  The Mountain Ash are the same throughout the years.  1st to go bare.  My thoughts are, who controls the Earth’s movements?  Is it some other planets?  Do they help or hinder our Earth and why?  The moon comes from the east to the west, on the southern part of our block. My birth date is ((summer; 1920's)).

The object presented at about ¼ the diameter of a full moon, but almost as bright.  The color of the light was amber to orange.  The light constantly flickered at a random and varying frequency.  There were lighter and darker parts to the light.   It was similar to observing a camp fire in the sky in its makeup and color. Originally spotted, it was about 20 degrees above the horizon.  After about 2 minutes, it had moved to about 45 degrees above the horizon, and appeared to be moving at a constant altitude.

During the time the object was traveling NE it traversed an arc of about 45 degrees of the field of view. No accurate estimate of altitude was possible, and therefore actual speed estimations are difficult.

I thought to myself, ‘what was that?’ as I was standing in an area south of Boston and near Logan airport… after a moment of contemplation I thought ‘not a plane’ still looking up suddenly another object of similar shape, with two diffused orange lights, side by side, this one much smaller and following the same path as the larger ‘craft?’ Again, as if I was watching a flying triangle made of water, diffusing the light, but when looking directly at it, one could absolutely see it moving across the sky. Both were moving much faster than what I’d describe as normal speeds for an aircraft -plane or helicopter.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,42.3416629506008,-71.06563371161549

The sky was clear and the weather was calm; it was not raining, snowing or foggy. The object was a single, large orange ball of light with a slight trail (also orange in color).  It darted from the right to the left in a 45 degree angle and did not emit fragments or particles.  The duration lasted approximately three to five seconds and the object was somewhat low in the sky.

Investigated by mysterous helicopter. About 23:45 hours on above date I recieved a call from a family member.  The family member was hysterical about a supposed UFO near our location.  This family member indicated that there was a UFO hovering over a major hotel in the area, that dozens of people had pulled over to watch it and that it showed no sign of leaving.  Myself and two other family members quickly got into a vehicle and drove to the location they were at.  While we were in transit, we saw a strange helicopter approach the area and alternatingly hover and search. This helicopter had the apparent length of a CH-47 military helicopter, but was unidentifiable due to lack of lighting.  It had none of the regular blinking red lights, but had alternatingly green, orange, and blue bright lights flashing in a regular pattern.  It appeared to have some sort of attached storage device under it, cube or rectangular shaped. The light configuration and storage construct was unlike anything I had seen before.  The altitude of the helicopter was about 75 meters.  The helicopter was there from about the time I recieved the call (possibly earlier) and bugged out at approx. 0010 hours in a N/NW direction. We approached the location my family member gave me and parked alongside 9 other vehicles, each with 2-5 people in them all looking in the same direction.  We personally were unable to see the UFO as it left minutes before we arrived.  We stayed for about 45 minutes and it did not reappear. The family member that called me took video on her cellphone and upon getting home, we loooked online and there was already one other video of the event posted. On a perhaps unrelated note, a cell phone in the house at 2232 hours experienced service interruption and emitted an electronic tone I have never heard before.  The tone sounded like the hybrid tone of a dial up phone, but without the tempo or form associated with that normal tone. The cell phone video my family member took is available if needed.

I will describe what we saw and have been seeking an explanation for since that night. No news reports have covered it.  11:00pm (approximately)  My partner had just gone to bed and I, a smoker like to sit outside the front door and smoke a cigarette as I do not smoke inside. I saw towards the Eastern sky a large ball of red which at first thought was a low flying plane's headlights. I found this strange as the light was very bright red/orange rather than white. All of the sudden, the light split into 3 distinct lights, very bright, same color but shaped in a perfect triangle. The lights seemed to hover a bit closer then suddenly split into a perfect line. This all happened within a couple of seconds - that fast.  The one light on the end started to hover away from the others for a bit and then the others followed. I stepped out onto the street at this point and watched them hover ever closer until they were almost above me. Their formation kept varying.  Sometime they would regroup and then another would hover away from the other - off to the side and then the others would stay still.  The one away from the others would rejoin the line and then continue moving.  It was very surreal. I noticed at this point that #1) there was no sound whatsoever associated with them and #2) they were not part of one object but rather each a distinct and separate object as it was a clear night and I could see up into the very clear night sky between each object. I followed them with my eyes until they went over house and tree line and then disappeared. I could no longer see them but then I noticed way up in the sky, almost appearing to be part of the stars little twinkling red lights moving in a formation. Previously, the objects had hovered over me at about the approximate height of what you would think of a rescue helicopter flying - I'd approximate about 800 - 1000 feet.  The now appeared to be flying in formation as high as a jet.  Again, this all happened within seconds.  I thought that was the end and I was left thinking about what I had just seen.  Just then, I turned and looked back towards where they had come and noticed another line of same identical objects. I quickly yelled for my partner to wake up and come outside which he did. We watched first 3 then 3 or 4 more all line up and again, hover over us. Both were wondering what they were as our neighbors across the street pulled in from work and came out to walk their dog. We pointed the lights out to them and they too stood there with us watching the strange lights. More lights came - approximately 10 in total.  My partner and I also witnessed together the rapid ascend into the night sky. I had pulled out my 300mm lens and my Nikon camera to try and photograph them but because of how dark it was I couldn't get the automatic focus to focus in properly on the objects and allow me to take a picture. I was however able to use it as a telescope/binocular of sorts and catch glimpses of them. My partner also took note that they had indeed disappeared into the night sky and became far distant twinkling red lights which seemed to fly in formation until they vanished.  I've been searching on sites including youtube videos of similar reports and I have found the following which look identical to what we saw that night.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imtq1_OxqPE  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaBjkjndDUg  I hope you can shed some light on this subject.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829

However, on this particular night, while driving home from eating out late ( I’m a waitress and often leave work after midnight ),  my boyfriend once again points out this blinking light over the ocean.   After parking at home and standing on our balcony to get a better look, we see that it is three lights, varying in colors and changing often from red to blue to white.  The lights are at equal level and seem to be suspended in one place just hanging there.  It was clearly not a plane or helicopter, and this is obvious as planes and helicopters are continuously passing by it simultaneously.  There is no comparison between the normal planes to this craft of lights.  They were totally different.  After about twenty mi! nutes the three lights that were once at equal level seemed to turn into a diagonal line and then slowly fade in brightness and visibility.  It was undoubtedly an odd experience.

The craft was directly in the KMSP approach pattern and was high above the houses at first.  After just a few seconds the two lights dropped down fast until they went below the trees and houses just behind our house.  I know that this was not an aircraft as it made no noise and had no other lights besides these two lights.  It also moved down without moving forward.   After it was no longer visible I went down to our computer and went to liveatc.net, there I tuned Minneapolis approach and listened a while until I heard a transmission to a Compass Airways jet telling it to take caution in a certain zone of the approach.   I then looked up that zone in my FAA Minnesota Aviation Charts book and saw that it happened to be near where I saw the craft.

The craft came a few miles closer and that is when I began to realize what I was looking at and it is something that I have never seen.  This ship seemed to move literally like a star destroyer (sorry I have not other reference, that is what it is) and it came a few more mile closer to me.  I tried recording with camera phone but it’s useless. I thought I would snoop around and see if any of the popular sites had the same information and it turns out that a man saw the black triangle in August.  Because of the darkness, I could not get an accurate look but this is a huge ship with the engines stacked as four rectangles laid two by two horizontally.  I do not get panicked but this is something that I have never seen or thought was humanly possible.  It was dark but from what little light I had it looked menacing, it looked like it was the size of an aircraft carrier.   I am not writing this as entertainment, I saw the ship shooting something out and I do not want to tell you what I think it was.

At first I thought they were coasting gulls and wondered why they would be so high. I watched as long as my eyes could discern them disappearing over the Diablo range of mountains.  Looking straight up again I observed two - four more of the white dots drifting in the same direction.  At one point one of them appeared to be tumbling.  I then noticed a large jet aircraft flying at an intermediate altitude also west to east along the same line.  I thought it very unusual to see an aircraft at that altitude traveling west to east.  Typically the aircraft have just taken off from San jose where they make a 180 degree turn to the south  or they are lining up to land at Oakland in the north. After the tumbling observation I wrote it off as spider webs.  Told my wife about it when I got home and thought that was the end of the story.  This morning I caught a glimpse of a video clip on google news (news organization not remembered) about the sightings over NYC.  While the clip focused on what appeared to be cluster of balloons, at the very end there was a brief shot of these white dots in sky. Seeing the similarity I had to tell someone. Does this make sense to you? ((ADDENDUM FROM SAME WITNESS)) Sorry about this, but I just filed a report about the white dots over Milpitas and I believe I got the day wrong.    I reported Wednesday, but I believe the sighting might have been Tuesday.  I remember wishing I had my glasses but my glasses were in my truck, which was in the shop on Tuesday. Like I said I thought they were spider webs until seeing the NYC videos.

I stepped outside in the early morning for a smoke break and to look at the sky since it was so clear out.  I walked around the firehouse to check and make sure everything was locked up and nothing was out of the ordinary.  As I turned the South West corner of the building I noticed a bright light approximately 10 miles away directly west of the firehouse. I watched this light for approximately 15 minutes trying to figure out what it belonged to. I was figuring a helicopter until I compared the object with a stationary object close to me.  That is when I noticed the object was moving from left to right approximately 2-3 miles at a time in less than a minute.  The object continued doing this with-out ever dimming, so I was able to dismiss the bright light as being a landing light on the front of an aircraft.

I quickly turned out my light, then after a few minutes woke my foster brother who made fun of me for the rest of the time he was with my family.

It was 1962.. I was 12 years old, as were my two friends.  We were sitting in the back of a car that was traveling, late at night, through Northern California farmlands...a back highway - of which there were still quite a few in those days. I don't remember exactly were we were...hard to know when one isn't a driver. But about an hour out of the Bay Area...very isolated countryside. My friend's parents were driving...they both had had a lot to drink ( were alcoholics, in fact...had my mother known that, I would not have been there). We heard them say, ""Hey! Lookit that! A flying saucer""!, and sitting up & looking out the front window, we could see far down the road up ahead, what looked like a big..thing...hanging in the sky above and near an old, closed roadhouse ( or business of some kind). We three in the back could not believe our eyes. While the laughing and hilarity ensued in the front seat , we became very serious. I know we were worried, and did not want to believe what the adults were saying. So as we approached it, we discussed what it was NOT.  We were trying to be the adults in that car. Not aiplane, heliocoptor, tower,clouds, balloon, blimp, lights in the sky... It was a very large circular metallic (ship was inescapable in our minds, because that is what it looked like) object just hanging there in the sky. The night was clear, and we saw it VERY clearly...it was not far up . It was large...larger than he building it was near. There were lights around the perimeter, and it was clearly dimensional...not flat. There was also a set of lights, on another, smaller object, that was flying around the big one...but in an irregular, darting manner. And nothing supported it...it was sitting in the air. We drove almost underneath it ( not quite, as it was off the road to the left), and the adults stopped the car ( laughing) to look at it. I think it may have been me who said "" Go!! Please go!"". All three of us in the back were scared, because we knew we were seeing something that ..should not be. And we three turned in our seats and watched it recede...for a very long time. The next day, my friend's parents dismissed it, angrily.  Did not want to talk about it....I think they were so inebriated at the time that they did not remember much. Years later, when I started college, I ran into my friend from the car...we had lost touch. And the very first thing she said to me - before hello!- was "" Do you remember what we saw?""  It had affected her as it did me...we saw something extraordinary and not easily explained.

I was in the 6th grade at Crestview Elementary School, in Miami, (Post Office, Opa-Locka, Fla,)  During recess in April 1967, I and hundreds of others students from Crestview and a few teachers, witnessed 3 oval shaped objects coming through a few clouds, on a mostly a clear day, directly over our heads.  My teacher gathered our class into a line.  We watched as the two smaller of the three oval objects, appeared to be dancing around the larger oval shaped object coming down towards us. The larger object, seemed to be the size of a cruise ship, but it's shape was oval and cigar shaped and shiny metal like.  I saw the large object land in the field near our school.  I didn't see where the other two objects went. What seemed like hours before long, we were told to go home. I was one of the students who rode our bikes to the landing area not far from our school.  We stepped over a burm and found a field of weeds and grass that appeared to be charred and smashed into an oval shape and seemed to be the size of a large boat.  There was no object there, but the remains of something that had recently been lying there. Before long, men in uniforms and news press started to interview kids.  I listened to a boy who had the same accounting as me.  The following day, the Miami Herald told the story and said that it was helicopters on maneuvers from the nearby Homestead Air Force Base.  I knew otherwise, and understand now that they had to state that to avoid mass hysteria. In the years to follow, I took my children to the sighting location, as they had heard my accounting for many years.  This was in the 90's and we found that in the same location, as where I saw he UFO land, was now the location of the Miami Football Stadium (off Miami Gardens Drive and 183rd Street)  which had been built, after they closed the Orange Bowl Football Stadium.  The stadium amazing stands in the very sight where I saw UFO land and come to think of it,  the UFO was about the size of the stadium floor! ((NUFORC Note:  Date probably is approximate.  PD))",,,

Six witnesses. I am not sure of the exact date or time but it was in the summer of 1968 and in the early evening/late afternoon. My friends and I were driving up Perfumo Canyon Road to visit friends who lived on top of the mountain. Perfumo Canyon Road begins in San Luis Obispo and winds up the mountain until it reaches the top, then it descends downward on the other side to near Avila Beach, California. At the time of the sighting there were only two residences at the top of the mountain. My friends had no electricity but had a gas water heater and a windmill. At certain points in the drive, which is made up of hairpin turns and sharp angles, one can get a view of the coastline stretching north from the point of Cayucos California to Grover City in the south. At the point where we saw these craft we had a view with Morro Bay and the towers of the electricity generating plant almost directly in the middle of our view. What we saw were five lights. They were at a considerable distance and no shape could be discerned. This happened during the early evening and the light can only be described as bright yellowish. We all saw the lights and were quite shocked and immediately stopped the car. One of our members was so excited that he actually pushed down on the handle of the car, I think we were in my 1955 Buick, but can't remember. Anyway, he fell out of the car. The five lights were in an obvious formation, three were in an absolutely straight line, waiting on the other two. One was directly over the Morro Bay power plant, the other was headed in a downward direction. We got the impression that they were either refueling using energy from the plant or were curious and were taking samples. We watched them for a while and then got our friend back into the car and proceeded up the mountain. When our car came around the sharp hairpin turn they must have seen our lights because the two that were down by the plant immediately zoomed up to the other three and in a perfect line they left the earth in a parabolic curve. They vanished in a matter of seconds at an incredible rate of speed and obviously did not want to be seen. We were all very young at this point in time but all credible.

My husband and I were in our back yard taking photos of the sky.  We had a number of twin rotor helicopters fly over our home, about 6-7 times in an hour so we were just outside watching.  The last helicopter flew over at approximately 15:01 according to the time stamp on the cell phone video I took of it.  It was a nice day so we decided to stay outside in the yard.  We are near CAK and so there is a lot of jet traffic in our area all the time and we are used to it...however on this day there was much more air traffic than normal.  My husband noted that some of the jets were moving unusually fast and although they should have been in ear shot, were making no noise that we could hear from the ground. I began snapping photos of those jets and their contrails. Upon review of the photos on my digital camera I noticed a dark spot in one of them.  Thinking it was just a piece of dirt on the LCD screen I scrolled to the next photo, and when I did the spot disappeared. I went back to the previous photo and the spot was there again, at this time I took the memory card out and put it in my lap top so that I could zoom in. I fully expected the spot to be a bird or falling leaf, however it was neither of these things.  My husband and I know for a fact that at the time we took the photo there was no helicopter in the area and the closest jet was the one in the far distance of the photo.  I tried to debunk the spot, but I can find no plausible explanation for what I captured on the photo. To me, it appears a dull gray metallic object, triangular or boomerang shaped, with a dark blue or black dome. I'm not sure why we did not see this object with our naked eyes...the only explanation I can give for that is that we were both focused on the jet in the distance and were talking to each other about it and the possibility that it was spraying chemtrails. I'm really at a loss to explain what the object is and why it is there.  The fact that there were helicopter activity in the area leading up to the sighting makes me wonder if it may possibly be secret military craft, or something else.

This was my first sighting.  My hope is that the others that were there that day, will see this report and come forward with what they remember.  It isn't something that you’d forget. I haven't in all those years. I don’t have the exact day or year but I never thought I’d need to remember that part.  Just remembering the incident itself was enough for me, at the time.  I know where I lived as we only lived there between the years of 1967 to 1969, so I am able to narrow the timeframe down to those years.  My feeling is that it happened closer to 1968 and probably in the summer. This sighting happened when I was young (11 to 12 years old).   We lived in an apartment complex, in Oak Cliff, Texas (part of Dallas).  We had been outside hanging out, running around with our friends when we ended up at the back of our apartments.  Someone in our group, or it could have been someone already standing outside, was looking at an object hovering near to where our old elementary school was located.  It had my full attention. At first, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.  Over the years I’ve read about other people’s encounters or sightings and sometimes it’s an object that’s so far away that it might have been any number of things, such as: a planet, a star, a plane, a weather balloon, a meteor, etc...Even the pictures that have been posted at times leave anyone questioning what the heck the object was.  This sighting was nothing like that.  We were close enough and it was still daylight or more specifically, it was late afternoon, moving towards the evening.   We could see it clearly as it was a clear summer afternoon. I have tried to remember who was with us that afternoon.  I know it was my brother and I.  But, I also remember at least another person, maybe even two others.   We all stood there watching a UFO hovering in the air.   As I remember, I wanted a better look and finally went upstairs to the balcony.   When I did, I realized that several people (grown-ups) were coming out of their apartments to see what all the commotion was about. The craft was about 1300 - 1500 ft away from where we were standing, hovering near an elementary school.  It was about 30 to 60 ft in the air, just off to one side of the building.  There were no lights and it never moved.  From this distance, it looked about 3 to 4 inches across (maybe someone who knows the mathematical equations can figure out how big that would make the craft).  It was metallic grey in color just like you’d expect.   I don’t remember it being shiny.  I remember oval portholes that appeared to run all the way around the disk, at least the part I could see.  It was saucer shaped, but with those portholes in the middle, or right above the middle.  I didn’t see any landing gear, nothing hanging down from the craft and nothing above the craft.  We didn’t hear any noise but it wasn’t near enough for us to hear noise.  I also don’t remember it flying off.  So either it got so dark that we couldn’t see it any longer, or we all had to go in for the night, or…..yea! rs later, I had some thoughts that someone was looking out of those portholes at us.  The other part is that I don’t remember going home that night.  I could speculate about any number of things that might have happened but I won’t.  There are just some unanswered questions.  Most likely due to the amount of time it’s been since it happened. I remember checking the newspaper over the next week, thinking someone had played an excellent prank on a lot of people with some type of flying saucer-shaped balloon or something that looked exactly like a flying saucer.   I even told my mother about it and we both wondered what it could have been.  After a while, I just let it go. Then in about 2002, I started to wonder if what I saw was a dream.  I decided to ask my brother if he remembered seeing something back in the day hovering near our school.  He finally said he saw the same thing that I saw and that’s about all he would say (don’t ask me why).  With this acknowledgment from him, I brought it up in a conversation with my mother who said she remembered me asking her to check the newspapers and that she remembered me telling her I had seen a flying saucer.  Oh man, I can’t tell you how much that meant to me as again, I had started to think that maybe I dreamed it all up.   Finally, someone was able to confirm to me that all those years ago I had mentioned my sighting to them, right after it happened. After having another sighting in 2007, I finally broke down and told my husband (almost 20 years into our marriage) that I had actually seen a flying saucer or something that looked just like one, many years ago.  He has no reason NOT to believe me, but I know that unless you’ve seen one yourself or you were there, you’re left wondering if that person really saw what they think they saw. As the late “Star Hustler”, Jack Horkheimer always used to say, “Keep looking up!” and I always will. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",,,

Normally this would be of no concern or significance as we live in an area less than 2 miles from our municipal airport and between Beal AFB and Sac IAP, but the strobe of the light was a bit odd, a white light strobing at a pace of slightly slower than 1 sec per flash.   I casually followed the path of the object as it traveled south east then made a long turn that eventually became a large counter-clockwise circle several miles in diameter.  Once again this would not be unusual as planes often circle around waiting for an open runway to land on, but the arc took a long time to complete and the object was at an abnormally high altitude for a plane waiting to land.   I brought this to the attention of my wife then called my two daughters and my mother in law to observe and see if they found it odd.  As we watched the object continued to circle around at the same altitude and speed with each lap taking approximately 10 minutes.   On one lap the object passed directly overhead and we could see that it was two distinct lights of the same size one in front of the other with a small red light that did not strobe joining the two lights.   When the lights would fade out between strobes there did not appear to be any discernible shape to the object and there was no noise.   Also, faint lights or reflective objects appeared to fall away from the object from time to time and proceeded in every direction, but were observable for only a very short time, a second or two at the most.   This continued until 9:00 pm PST the object then took a path directly north east till we could no longer see it.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,38.937,-121.2519

I found this site by accident, and it sparked a memory of something I observed 40 years ago. The actual date is lost to me now, but I believe it was Autumn 1970, possibly October as it was dark at 7pm when I left my parent’s apartment to attend an evening institute class.  It was in a suburb of North London called Finsbury Park.  I was 20 years of age and considered myself observant. Their apartment was at the top of a block about 50ft off the ground.  Their front door led out onto a balcony walkway with an unobstructed view over approximately a half mile square plot of land that had about six water filtration reservoirs surrounded by a collection of low buildings that I would guess, housed tool stores, offices and maintenance vehicles.  Apart from the residential viewpoint I was looking from, there were blocks of houses to the left and to the right of the filtration plant.  A busy main road ran along the front of the plant site, about a half mile from where I was standing. What I saw from the balcony was a cone of very bright light pointing down from above.  The wide circle of light slowly and methodically searched the reservoirs and buildings in circular motions.  The sky was inky black and the reservoir area was only lit by low powered security lights as the place was only worked in during daylight hours and never, as far as I can recall, at night.  At no time during this sighting could I make out any shape looking up at the apex of the light beam. I called my father out and asked him what he thought it might be?  He said, ‘I think it’s an helicopter!’  I invited him to listen and he had to admit that all he could actually hear was the faint sound of the traffic on the main road, half a mile away and nothing else.   We stared at the light for another five minutes, then my father suggested that it might be a secret silent running helicopter with an astonishingly bright light that we don’t know about?  I suppose it was as good an explanation as we were going to get, though I rather doubted it on the grounds that if the military had perfected such a thing, then why did they insist on using extremely noisy machines in war zones? (to this day)  That’s the thing about helicopters, the noise, you can always hear an helicopter even if you can’t see it, the noise will bounce off buildings and trees which will make you look in the wrong place for it even if it’s behind you.  Unlike this thing which was somewhere in front of us and poss! ibly above us, but totally silent. I left the apartment and made my way down to the main road.  On the way, I entered a gap in the houses and this time got a side view, ground level looking up at the cone, still I couldn’t see anything on top of it, and it remained totally silent. Next I went to the main road and stared at the same view, this time with my parents apartment block behind the light source.  No silhouette, no sound other than the traffic behind me as the beam of light continued on it’s rounds of the site.  I stopped a man passing by and asked him to look at the light.  He didn’t, he just looked at me then accused me of being a drug addict. I got on a bus to go to my class and tried to get some passengers to look out of the window, most just looked at me, and the only guy who bothered to look out said it was an helicopter!  Helicopters were not that common in the U.K. back then as they are now.  Police helicopters and Air Ambulances are such a common sight these days that they seldom register.  Certainly the military had them back then, but you never saw any in suburban areas. When I witnessed this event, I was keen to tell as many people as possible.  Firstly, when I tried to inform whatever authority I could find, the Police, local government, newspapers, Water Authority and the BBC, was treated with disbelief or just plainly ignored.  The only thing the Police was interested in was where I had obtained the Water Board’s (Water Authority) phone number from when I told them that I had already spoken to them, and they told me to contact the Police. Over the years, I have related that story to people who I believed might make some intelligent use of it, but all I’ve ever got was ridicule and anger.  One smart guy I thought better of, shouted ‘YOU SAW A HELICOPTER’ and refused to talk about ever again.  People who were not there at the time and people who were not even born at the time have accused me of being on drugs, drunk, mentally unstable or just a plain old liar.  Some have offered physical abuse while a few have actually hit me.  The worst I suppose was having someone at a party tell the other guests that I’d seen a flying saucer with little green me in it.  No!  I would try to explain, what I encountered was a U.F.O.  It was above me, so ‘Flying’.  It was, I’m sure, an ‘Object’ and it was and remains so, ‘Unidentified’   A couple of years before that happened, I saw what appeared to be an aircraft flying high in the night sky. The single tiny white light was constant and moved in a straight line across the sky quite slowly giving the impression of great height.  Then directly above me, the light made an abrupt 70 degree angular turn and shot upwards and was gone in a second.  The various explanations I have been offered, either cynically or violently have been:-  You saw a...comet, a shooting star, a meteor, an aeroplane, a spy plane, a weather balloon, a satellite, a Chinese Lantern, the Moon and even Venus.  It’s little wonder I haven’t mentioned these things too much over the last four decades. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2010-08-24T00:00:00,,

During that show, it was mentioned that a UFO reportedly touched down in Dover, Massachusetts, in the early 1970s, with reported ground sightings.   As such, a friend and I may have seen the UFO entry as it approached Dover.  The following it what we witnessed. My friend and I were setting up a telescope to begin some experiments with astrophotography.  It was during the late fall or early winter of circa 1970 in Newton Centre, Massachusetts.  The time was about 9:00 p.m. and it was a clear moonless night, no wind but cold.  As I was adjusting the telescope mount, my friend said, ""Look at that!""   I looked up and between a large clearing in the trees was an object silently gliding across the sky at about 45 degrees above the horizon out of the NNE heading in a southerly direction   The object had the shape of a pie pan being viewed from edge on or in other words a trapezoid geometry.  It was tipped up almost vertical (maybe leaning 10 degrees to the right) with the shorter base of the trapezoid on the right and the longer base of the trapezoid on the left.   The length of the longer base was about the diameter of a nickel held at arms length.  The entire surface of the trapezoid was a pale yellowish color, which appeared to deepen to a yellowish-orange as it passed out of our site and behind some trees.    The object made no noise nor emitted any visible exhaust trail as it glided across our view.   Interestingly, it did appear to interact with the air as its movement was one of a wallowing as if it were spilling air as it moved along.     Neither of us had seen anything like this before or since and cannot explain it based on anything we can account for. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The UFO had bright lights that changed color.  It was if the UFO was checking us out.  A ship with all its running lights on would be easily seen from above in the Atantic.  I was ((specialty deleted)).  Some names I remember were fellow ((specialties deleted)).  ((name #1 deleted)), ((name #2 deleted)) and ((name #3 deleted)).  I can't be sure they were aboard for this Duty, but I'm sure at least one was.  I can not remember the others.   The UFO would come down hovering above us.  We could see what I would describe as portholes.  I rotated as it hovered.  The lights changed color.  Then it would go up in a second becoming very small.  Then it seemed to show off, as if it knew we were watching it.  It would accelerate across the sky in a split second while doing right angles.   Many photos of this craft were taken with telephoto lens.  I remember I couldn't wait to see the photos after they were developed.  I never saw them.  The show lasted about an hour.  Messages of this sighting were sent to Washington, DC.!   When we were relieved from Ocean Station Duty, we headed back to Governor's Island, Yankee Pier, where was our home port.  We were not expecting the reception that we received.  As we were docking, I saw quite a few ""Men In Black"" waiting to board our ship.  Usually after docking, if you did not have duty, we were granted liberty of usually 72 hours.  No one was allowed to leave the ship.  We were all interrogated one by one by these ""Men In Black"".  We were told to sign an affidavit, stating we saw nothing.  We were warned that if we mention this to anyone, we would be gone.   We were told not to go to any news media, and try and tell this story.  If we did, we would be prosecuted by the govenment.   I found out later that my friend, the ((specialty deleted)) had all of his photo equipment, pictures, and developing equipment confiscated.  He was not reimbursed for any of his expensive equipment, it was simply taken from him.   I will end the story here, to be brief as possible.  Please give me a call at ((number deleted)) my home phone after recieving this, so I know you received it.  Please keep this confidential as possible.  I'm sure you will.  I will research the Internent and my old photos, to see if I can get some crewmember names.

Old UFO report. This sighting occurred in the early 1970's on River Road in Wilmington, NC around 2 am in the morning.  I am reporting it now because I am older and have heard of similar objects being seen on UFO tv reports.  So what the heck, I'll tell what I saw and maybe it will do some good. I was in my convertible traveling north along River Road about 2 am.  It was a clear night and the stars where out, no fog or clouds.  Then a very large craft came over the trees, I was very scared and thought 'what if I'm abducted'.  I pulled my car over so as not to draw attention to myself.  It was massive, about the width and length of a football field.  The shape reminded me of one of those Star Wars big star ships like the one at the beginning of the 1st episode but it didn't have a large top area, it was smooth and triangular, at the end it had 3 very large round engines just like the Star Wars ship.   The color was identical to the sky, when it went over me it blacked out the stars but looked like a hole in the sky because of the color match.   It was moving slowly, I'd say not much more than 35 mph and just above the trees, about 120 feet (tree hight 80' plus another 40').  It was dead silent, no noise at all and no lights, no windows that I could see,  As it pa! ssed, heading south, that's when I saw its features.   I watched until out of sight then got out of there.  I've kept it to myself until recently and then joked I saw a UFO then woke up.  But, what the heck, if will do some good or maybe someone else will recognize the description. I wonder what they have been doing all these years.  Obviously not attacking.  As I see it, if you have the means to travel like they must, you have access to all the resources you would ever want so mental growth would be more of a priority than desires to acquire things.  Hope this helps. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2010-08-24T00:00:00,34.23837495219885,-77.87846768642447

It was our annual neighborhood 4th of July party at the end of the dead end street. A forested area surrounded the end of the street. I was sitting in a lawn chair watching fireworks down on the street (the neighbors yard was up on a small hill), when I noticed something coming across the sky from the east. I knew it was far too high to be a firework, and the object was getting brighter as it got closer. It was coming what I perceived as slowly, so at first I thought it was some kind of air plane.  I was just surprised at how bright it was getting and close to be a small plane, since it was too close to be a commercial jet.  I don't really remember much sound either, no engine sounds for sure.  When it finally reached us, I saw it was a circular craft.  It hovered right above the poplar trees at the end of the street where we were all gathered!   Amazing, I was really amazed since my father watched Star Trek and being so young I was thinking it was something from the show....I could see the bottom of it, it hovered there with a very quiet sound, a quiet humming but not like any engine I had ever heard(boat,plane,car,tractor, ect).  It had different color lights on the edges on the bottom.  The lights circled around the perimeter of the bottom at equal distances. It hovered there for at least 15 minutes that I can remember.  It was close.  I'm not good at estimating size, but I have a Ford F250 now, and you could fit three of them in the diameter of this craft easily.  The most amazing thing was its departure.  This is when reality hit me that this was not something from TV, even though I was only 6 or 7 years old.  It started to ascend upward, somewhat slowly, but then suddenly it just shot extremely fast straight up above the earth, and became just visible like a small star within just a few seconds, and then I totally lost view of it.  I have never seen or heard of any mechanical thing moving this fast in my life ever since I saw that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The exact day of the month I can not recall. I happened to look up at the sky as I was riding and saw what I first thought was the moon, but then noticed it seemed brighter and orange-ish in color…and was featureless. (no dark spots or “man in the moon”)  Almost immediately  it grew until it filled the entire sky, then disappeared completely. The effect was like the moon was falling and I remember ducking! I stopped riding and continued to watch the sky, wondering what I had seen. Suddenly it was back…in the same position as the first time, only a green-ish color this time. Again it quickly grew until it filled the whole sky, then disappeared again just like before. I was a bit scared at this point (I was 14 at the time) and rode home quickly, telling my mother what I had seen as soon as I got in the house. About 10 minutes later a report came over the radio (local AM station) saying that “strange lights you may have seen in the sky” were “atmospheric testing”. At that time you accepted what you heard on radio or TV as fact, so case closed. Later in life I often wondered what sort of “atmospheric testing” it could have been and why I had never heard anything more about it. I have since searched the internet extensively and can find no mention of any type of testing that could produce this sort of phenomena,  I was tempted to make this report after reading a very similar report dated 2/20/70 in Ft. Dix, NJ, which is only about 60 miles from my sighting location in Wilmington, DE. The NJ report says “date approximate” so I wonder if their sighting could have actually been 4 months earlier, as I’m fairly certain of the month and year.

As kids I remember we thought the garage was haunted or had special powers or something. we used to go try the door which was always locked but we would always get scary feelings or felt something was weird there.  Maybe just kids talking about the unknown or maybe kids know something.  Well this one time we were walking back thru the field and I looked back for some reason to see a glowing figure of a person standing in or near one of the bins.  I can only describe it as glowing light, with no facial features but just in the shape of a person.  My friend and I were so scared we ran! home across the field and ofcourse nobody believed us.

I was eleven years of age and lived on a farm with my parents, grand parents, three younger brothers and one sister.  We lived approximately 21 miles west of the town of Geneseo, IL.  Our closest neighbor lived just across the road and down about ¼ mile and our house was almost completely surrounded by woods. One night in the summer, I became aware that I was not in bed in the basement of the house where I and my siblings slept but rather I was sitting on a bench in a “room” with one adult male who was about in his mid 20's.  The room was constructed of metal as were the benches, there was one door  in the compartment and on either side of the door were “windows” from which I could see a passageway going to the left and right and had a slightly slanted inward wall turning into the ceiling of the passageway.  The other person in the compartment with me sat on the bench to the left side of the door and completely ignored me even when I shook him and tried to get him to look at me, he just sat on the bench with his elbows on his knees gazing downward between his legs at the floor.  I tried to open the door but it was locked and I got up on the bench to the right side of the door and leaned against the glass which slanted outward and tried to see something beside the metal walls but ! all I saw was an empty passageway.   The room was lighted but I did not see any source of light such as a light bulb. After I looked around the basically empty compartment I again tried to get the adult male in the compartment with me to pay attention to me and help me understand what was happening to us but still he just sat there.  I looked up at the window and saw a “creature” about 4.5 feet tall, I think covered almost totally with a reddish long hair but his face looked human like and it did not pay any attention to us in the compartment, just slowly walking by the window.  I was very scared and when I'm afraid of something of someone I tended to attack.  I jumped on to the bench and them beat on the “glass” and screamed and tried to break the glass but at the same time was scared to death I would break it.  The being just kept walking by and it was shortly there after that I stopped remembering anything. I woke up the next morning about 4:30 when it was time to go do the morning chores.  I never did tell my parents or anyone else because I was sure that they would not believe me.  Additionally, I did not know the other person in that compartment with me.

I do not recall the exact date, as the sighting was years ago.  It left an indelible impression on me.   I know that it occurred at night over Houston, TX between 1973-1974. We were attending a men’s flag football league game at Memorial Park.  My husband was one of the coaches.  I was seated in a lawn chair watching the game.   I saw what I thought was an airplane crossing the sky, but it suddenly came to a full stop.   I mentioned it to the lady sitting next to me.   She said she had binoculars in the car and would get them. What I saw through her binoculars (and other people there, too) was actually not just one light, but a string of lights.  I do not recall the exact number of lights in a row that I saw, maybe 5-7.  They were close together. My husband was getting exasperated, as the football players all wanted to watch the object through the binoculars. As we watched this object, it appeared to be turning slowly in various directions.   The string of lights would change into a narrow oval, gradually expanding until it became a full circle of lights.   It kept hovering for approximately 45 minutes, continually changing shape from a string of lights, to an oval, and to a full circle, the reversing the direction of turning.   It even turned so that it was completely vertical, with what looked like flares coming from each light, yet it appeared totally stationary in the sky.   There were no colored lights, just bright white ones. All of a sudden, the object ascended in a southwestly direction and was gone within seconds.

At approximately 2:00 am I saw a spherical object hovering above a hill across the American River where we were camped.  It was August, and hot enough that my friend and I were camping on the sand in sleeping bags, with no tent.  I awoke around 2 and sat up in my bag.  Directly across the river above a hill was a yellow-orange spherical object.  It appeared to be lit from within. The object hovered perfectly still, making no sound whatsoever.  It was the kind of night that was so clear and quiet you could hear a camper 100 feet from you clear his throat. It’s difficult to gauge the size of the object, but it appeared to be about 20 to 25 feet in diameter.  I awakened my friend when the object began to move.  My friend only witnessed the object in motion; it is unfortunate that I did not waken him sooner. The object did not appear to accelerate.  What I mean is, it went from a dead standstill to a fast pace, apparently instantly.  It was as if I were watching a computerized dot on a screen in animation.  The speed of the object was probably somewhere around 4 or 500 miles per hour.  It flew overhead, off to our right side, and out of sight in a matter of 5 or 6 seconds.  Again there was absolutely no sound, not even a whisper from the thing. I never reported this sighting, although it happened nearly thirty years ago.

I then noticed a spherical shape in the sky.It was pretty small and I can only assume it was very high.  It looked like a miniature unar eclipse.It was dark in the middle and had a faint light all around the edge.  It then started to drop toward me, getting bigger in size as it got closer and closer. The size grew dramatically starting from a tennisball size to about 50 ft in diameter.It looked like it was going to hit the house!  At that time I jumped from behind the couch where i was standing and screamed for my parents!  I think it was my mom that came to get me and told her what i had seen.  She obviously did'nt believe me.  I later went back to the window and as quick as the UFO appeared,it had disappeared.  I do remember that it was dark grey in colour as it got closer and looked like it was also spinning. About 5 years later I was watching the news(Netwerk) on TV with my dad and there were reports of UFO sightings in another area of the country. There were also a few photographs on the screen.And the picture was 3 ball shaped objects that looked EXACTLY like the one I had seen!

I was studying physics for three years and a half and I know well the southern sky, where I live. That was my only sighting in my life and I never talked about it with anyone. I would like to report this sighting, because I found your site seriously. I was watching the sky with my small telescope with a 100-fold increase. That night they were visible to the west, Mars, Jupiter and the Moon (Half Moon). At approximately 11 hours PM a little below the moon, a red object appeared, almost as bright as Mars. I quickly pointed my telescope at the object and was amazed at what I saw. A huge hexagonal object with a jet red below it. The object was black, but you could see your way, because it was illuminated by sunlight. Your speed was relatively slow and I could perfectly accompany him using the levers of the telescope. After a few minutes following the object, it has exactly opposite the Moon, which gave me a reference to then calculate its size. Follow the object for about one hour, and from a certain point I no longer needed to move the telescope. At that point I was looking at the object underneath. That was approximately in the region of Formalhaut. The jet of energy emitted by this object was very different from anything I've ever seen in my life. It looked like a mix of ""flaring"" with laser light. On the following Monday I called the astronomical observatory of Campinas, and did not give me much attention.  They asked me to describe the sighting eto in the end I say, ""What you saw was a weather balloon.""  Honestly, I know a balloon.  Do not release balloons burst of energy, not hexagonal and not fly out of the atmosphere (so that the object was illuminated by sunlight). I then calculate the size of the object with the data I had on hand, I could calculate the minimum size of this object, and was surprised to reach the size of 17km (11 miles) from side to side. I would like you to get in touch with me and guide me on how best to publicize this sighting. Sorry for my english,",2011-01-05T00:00:00,,

My friend and I decided to go to the Las Vegas Drive-in movie theater on October 13, 2010 at about 9:45pm.  We drove up to the screen that was showing our movie which pointed the car in the north direction in the large parking area.  I was sitting in the driver's seat and my friend was in the passenger's seat to the right of me.  There were a few cars around us and another screen directly to the right. It was facing east and playing another movie.  There was also another screen facing east that was next to the second screen farther south of the parking area. About an hour into the film, my friend gasped and asked ""what is that?""  I glanced above the screen that was showing our film and we both noticed a V shaped object with circular lights on its underside. It was descending at a 90 degree angle just above and to the right of the screen.  It was smaller than the moon in comparison.  Its overall color was not determinable.  It seemed to descend in a fashion that mimicked a bird's. Before it passed behind the screen that was directly to the right of our car, the V shape of the object changed into a W shape.  I still can't explain how it managed to do this.  There was no sound of an engine or anything that would propel the craft.  After it passed behind the screen to the right and right before it disappeared behind the second screen to the right, it began to fade away into nothingness.  It looked as if it activated some sort of cloaking mechanism that appeared otherworldly and frankly, unnerving.

We had planned to take a short trip across town to visit my mother that evening, and our only vehicle at the time was his motorcycle. As we mounted the bike in the driveway we looked up and in the distance saw three blinding white lights. They weren't far from the ground; two below and one above in a tight triangle configuration. My fiance was in the Air Force at the time and worked at Wright Paterson on the weekends. ""What the Hell is that?"" he wondered aloud. ""It's probably just highbeams on a crane"" I suggested. We would know soon enough since we had to head in that direction.  We drove for about a mile, all the while my ex was saying ""What the Hell is that??"" Eventually we came close enough to be able to tell that it was too high up to be lights attached to a crane, but they were dead still. Suddenly we noticed that a large rectangular space behind the lights was far darker than the sky around it. My ex yelled ""WHAT THE FUCK IS IT??!  Then slammed on his brakes as about six African American kids ranging in age from about ten to sixteen dashed in front of our bike. Their eyes were also fixed on the monstrous craft. And it was bloody huge. Not ""Independence day"" huge-but easily as large as a football field or larger. It was gunmetal gray; like a giant monolithic slab  about the proportions of a thick cereal box or box of cigarettes with slightly raised and depressed geometric shapes of various sizes on it's surface (it was not smooth at all). It hovered over a large empty parking lot that stretched out in front of an abandoned Rink's department stor! e. The road we were on was busy, but I didn't notice if others had stopped to look. The craft had the three painfully bright lights mounted on what looked like it's front. There were smaller amber/ red and bluish green lights underneath it that glowed steadily, and as we kept driving we came around to the ""back"" of the craft, which featured three (maybe four) flat, glowing rectangular panels in a horizontal row that were tilted slightly downward. They looked like large observation windows to me, and I felt-or perhaps even saw-figures moving around inside. I didn’t want to see anymore and looked down. My former fiance finally said ""We have to get closer!"" and I completely flipped out -and I'm not one who is given to ""flipping out"". He turned the bike toward the craft and I hit him hard and told him that there was no way in hell that he would take me any closer. I was in tears I was so frightened. Just as this was happening the group of boys that had crossed in front of us co! uld be seen running across the expanse of the parking lot towa! rd the a rea under the craft. As they neared it I glanced down for a second time, not wanting to see what was happening,  and as I did I heard my ex exclaim ""Holy Fuck!!"" I looked and the kids were standing there, but the craft had disappeared. Ken said that it had shot straight up into the sky at a speed that was simply unbelievable. I begged him to keep driving and we continued on. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although source of report does not indicate that fact.

This happened on the outskirts of Lowell, in one of the more suburban areas along Andover St. At approximately 9:30 PM I went outside to take the trash out.  It was raining pretty hard and I remember it being exceptionally dark that night.  I walked out the front door with the bag of trash and around the back of our house.  As I turned the corner from the side of the house to the back, I saw a huge, round, red light hovering in the sky almost directly above me.  It seemed really close- maybe JUST  above the trees (and certainly below the clouds), but it made absolutely NO sound. It was large. if you hold a small paper plate at arm’s length in front of you while looking at the sky, that’s about the size.  The light was deep red, like a stop light, and in the 20 seconds I watched it, it didn’t flicker, fade, or pulse.  It was solid.  I remember thinking how strange it was that it was just glowing with no portion of the circle being any brighter than another and had no different characteristics - just one massive, solid, glowing orb in the sky. At some point, I looked away to drop the trash into the barrel I’d been standing next to, and when I looked back, the orb was gone.  I waited a few more seconds to see if it would return, but it didn’t. It’s been 20 years since it happened and I STILL think about it all the time, as if it just happened yesterday.  Every so often I search the net but have never found much until now, when I found NUFORC.  Reading through this site, just the Massachusetts section alone, I can’t believe how many people have had similar experiences. On a side note, for reference purposes, the accounts I’ve read from July 4th 2010 and the subsequent videos all over Youtube from that night are very similar to what I experienced, except, in my case, the single orb was red, didn’t move and seemed closer to the ground (just due to the size difference).

These two events occurred in 1989 and 1995 respectfully (approximate) in Phoenix AZ.  I lived North of the city, pretty dark in those days. The first:  Facing South, a white, star-like solid light, like a medium size star, appeared in the sky very, very high up, at an almost-directly-overhead latitude and crossing the sky coming out of the East to West. I immediately thought it was a satellite. Way too high to be an airplane.  It was either already in space or just on the fringe. And faster than a satellite I was use to seeing. But just as I told the person I was with to ""look, it's a satellite"", the object stopped crossing the sky half way, almost directly overhead, and literally stopped on a dime, and then went straight up into space, fading out.  It didn't continue across the sky like a satellite would and then instantly 'blink' out when it went into earth's shadow.  This object went straight up.  A 90-degree instant 'turn' up into space.  I verified this in my mind by acknowledging that it did not 'cross' any more stars in any direction. I'm a private pilot, university graduate and voluminous readings, I know of nothing that would act like this, particularly that it was so high to start with, traverse half the sky, and then abruptly stop and go into space and fade out, not suddenly blink out. Now here's the kicker:  about six years later, my wife and I were standing in my backyard, same house, facing North this time, looking up towards the horizon, not straight up.  I had told her my UFO story. Suddenly, There...I instantly knew it was the same 'object', probably because it’s so different then my ‘normal’. It suddenly appeared coming at us, from North to South this time, crossing the sky towards us at a very fast speed.  Both were traveling much faster then the satellites I've seen crossing the sky.  So, from first sighting it near the horizon to it going up into space took about seven seconds and then another two/three seconds as it faded out)   Without taking my eyes off of it this time, I told my wife, ""see the light coming at us?""   Watch...it’s going to come almost overhead, stop, and then go straight up into space and fade out!   And it did just that as I was describing what it would do to her!!  Again, never went 'by' any more starts verifying that it did indeed go 'straight up' into space. And now I have a witness who's always with me (married). so now it's 'we' who saw it!  Ran across your article in the SOCO Magazine here in Boston MA and thought I'd send you this 'tale'.  I've seen rockets launched in the Air Force (I worked on Minuteman Missiles), saw the shuttle launch in Fla., a missile 'blowup' just after launch in New Mexico (from our backyard in Phx) leaving the colorful contrails from the rising morning sun, we've seen satellites, the shuttle, the space station (as I acknowledged, they cross the 'entire' sky then suddenly blink out when they go into the earth's shadow) but I’ve never seen anything this high in the sky, just a 'bright' dot of a light, that initially looked like a satellite but traveling much faster, stop on 'a dime', and go straight up into space and just fade out. Any ideas as to what these/this could have been? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2010-08-24T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

I recall everyone gathered above the top of the Edmonds Library for a quick break and re-assignment when one of us spotted 3 flashing lights in the sky above Puget Sound.  All of us stopped talking and were in shock to notice these circular white and red lights make triangle formations in the sky.  They appeared to be playing and chased each other at rapid and then slow speeds to re-group.  At one point, they disappeared into the night sky and then came back to spin/zip around.  Eventually, a 4th one came down and then they disappeared by fading so high into the sky we could no longer see them after 15min or so.  Some of the teens cried and went home.  The police officer who was there literally got teary-eyed from fear and asked that we not ever speak of what we witnesse! d that night because he promised to deny it, and advised people to leave.

I was sleeping under the stars in July, or early August after a long night of amateur astronomy.  My eyes opened about 4:00 AM, judging from the constellations overhead.  I looked directly above me, and was caught off guard by a very slow moving satellite in orbit exactly overhead.  It was pretty faint.  I was barely able to detect its movement except that I watched it for over a minute, and I could see that it had slowly moved against the backdrop of stars, making its way southward.  Then, without warning, the satellite took a sharp 90 degree turn and accelerated to an incredible amount of speed in a westward direction.  Within a fraction of a second it was gone.  From what I remember I only saw it for a few moon lengths after it had taken the right turn before it was gone from view.  I was in my early teens at the time.  I refused to believe I had seen something extra terrestrial since I was a big science buff, and had always observed the scientific consen! sus refute UFO's as having been extra terrestrial spacecraft.  For over 20 years I didn't even think about what I saw until I began hearing the myriad of other UFO recounts that described lights taking sudden right degree turns like the one I saw.  It's still hard for me to accept that what I saw was extra terrestrial, but whatever I saw it seemed to violate the laws of physics, at least in terms of propulsion.

I don't remember the exact year or month but it was in the summer of '87 or '88.  I parked my car in front of my parent's house in NE Albuquerque and got out when I spotted a spherical object with different colored lights flashing randomly.  It appeared to be about 50' in diameter and moving from east to west approximately 300' above the ground.  I'm a pilot and am pretty good at identifying aircraft, altitudes and distances.  The object was moving slowly, maybe 40mph, and was silent.  My first thought was this was a weather balloon and someone had rigged it with Christmas tree lights and a battery as a hoax.  I couldn't tell if the orb was tumbling randomly or if the lights just made it appear so. When the object had gone about 2 miles west of me it shot north (maybe 15 miles?) and immediately west and upward until it disappeared in the distance.  It did this in less than a second or two and made the 90 turn from north to west without slowing or arcing.  This was NOT a weather balloon nor am I aware of any aircraft that can move that quickly or perform an immediate change in direction like I witnessed. I was stunned in amazement at what I'd just seen.  I saw a man and a woman who were at a park about 4 houses up the street and asked them if they saw it.  They said they did and asked me what it was.  I asked them if they saw it shoot north and west and they had.

My brother was going blah blah blah in the passenger seat, and needless to say I had him on ignore until he said something about my girl. I snapped my head up but instead of giving him grief I saw the red cigar thingy couldn't of been rescue vehicles as it was floating very slowly over the field towards the screen. I hit my brother to shut up then he saw it as well. It had only traveled roughly a 1/4 mile between when I first saw it till the second time I didn't think anything could fly so slow and no sound. People started pom-ping their horns and getting out of their vehicles pointing to it as it drifted behind the screen. All of a sudden there was a tremendous racket and we covered our ears, Three air force jets flew over top of us and flying in formation they maneuvered behind the craft. The jets flew a little closer but maintained there distance.  About 10 minutes later it was over millbrook area and out of sight. Some cars sped out but we sat and talked and enjoyed the movie, my brother was not in the  drinking mood just in aah. I wasn't drinking that night or nor am I drinking now as I'm a Christian.

March 1997  Approx one month after moving into new mobile home in Chandler, AZ. I was having a very disturbing and extremely realistic bad dream in the dream I was sleeping and woke up to commotion and light in my bedroom the light did not come from any lamp or light source that I had in the room it was like a flooding light not that bright but illuminated the whole room from what I remember I saw three small thin short aliens the exact kind we call the GREYS one was next to my husbands head one at the foot of the bed and when I went to sit up in bed I turned to my side and there was one right next to me by the headboard of the bed as I went to sit up the grey took his long skinny index finger (3 fingers and a thumb) and touched me very lightly on the forehead right between the eyes and the next thing I remember I woke up sat straight up in bed full of adrenaline really freaked out.  I pulled open the curtain and through the blinds saw that the sun was barely rising. I thought to myself I have only been asleep for about 5 hours. I am so unbelievably thirsty but if I get up and go get a drink I wont be able to go back to sleep.  I am going to feel like crap if I can’t get a few more hours but my mouth was so dry when I tried to swallow I hadn’t any saliva and gagged. With The adrenaline rush and the thirst I rolled off my high pedestal waterbed and when I tried to stand my knees buckled. I became extremely weak I felt like I had hiked a mountain lifted weights and been beaten and in a car accident all at the same time.  My whole body was sore. My muscles were aching legs weak head felt so heavy I actually felt drugged. Sort of how you would feel after having outpatient surgery where you get anesthesia and an hour later you are woken up and ready to go home. I pulled myself together and walked to the kitchen.  I never drink tap water but this time I grabbed a kid’s cup and went to the sink.  As it was filling I looked out the window that was over the sink and saw my 6month old kitten sitting on the hood of the neighbors car across the yard looking at me. I remember gasping and almost choking because I hadn’t drank yet when I saw her.  I thought damn there must be a hole under one of the cabinets to the outside or something.  She was an indoor cat and never had been outside and she was in bed with me when I fell asleep that prior evening. I quickly drank the water and went to the door which was locked (both locks) unlocked it opened it. I gasped again because the scrunchie hair-tie that I ALWAYS wore in my long hair to bed so my hair stays out of my face was on the front porch step. I ran out grabbed the cat and went back to my bedroom feeling very bewildered and confused. My thoughts immediately went back to my dream. My husband got out of bed and got dressed and left for work he was going in earlier than usual since we were awake 3 hours early. I didn’t tell him anything other than I had a bad dream. I didn’t want to sound crazy. As soon as he was gone I called my mom in Illinois to tell her about the dream and how real it seemed when it comes to paranormal and metaphysical things she is very open-minded. I told her how I woke-up found the cat the hair tie etc. and I expected her to say something like oh honey you just had a bad dream or maybe I was sleepwalking (which I have never done). But what she told me instead of something comforting and reassuring was a story that thoroughly freaks me out and yet sounds so familiar. According to my mother Sharon lee mowatt-hardwick in the summer/fall 1975 my grandparents ken and Ethel mowatt were on their way to las Vegas to go gamble like they did every so often. Somewhere between the Arizona border and Vegas my grandfather saw a very bright light that seemed to be following them.  He was positive it wasn’t Venus as they were in the mountains and the horizon where Venus rises and sets wasn’t visible. The light followed for so long that he decided to pull the car off the road to see if it was a helicopter would pass over them and my grandmother had wanted her sweater, which was in the trunk of the car Granddaddy told my mom when he got out of the car he saw the light getting really close and really bright but he was puzzled as there was absolutely no sound whatsoever coming from what he assumed to be a helicopter. As the light was right over them another thing he noticed was the lack of the blinking lights that every plane helicopter aircraft are required to have just the one steady white round bright spotlight. The next thing my grandfather says he recalls is the fact that when he blinked his eyes it was suddenly daylight my grandma who had been inside the car was standing right next to him wearing the sweater he had never gotten out of the trunk inside out. They looked at each other dumbfounded got into the car and proceeded to Vegas When they arrived at the motel the desk clerk immediately informed them that they were almost 6 hours late for check-in and our family and the Highway Patrol had been looking for them fearing an accident. Over the next month they both started having dreams and flashbacks. Granddaddies were of seeing Mum on an exam table surrounded by 4 grays and they were doing something to her breast. He attempted to sit up from a laying position and a grey placed his 4-fingered hand flat on granddaddy’s chest and that’s it. Mum just had dreams of being examined by children. Granddaddy died on Christmas Eve 1984 of lung and esophageal cancer when the chest x-rays were given to my grandma the clouded mass of cancer in his chest was in the exact shape of a small hand. Mum passed in ’92 of breast cancer and she had a mastectomy done prior to her death where a small long thin piece of metal was removed from her breast tissue and analyzed. The lab could not identify what is was or was made of they gave it to my mom in a small glass vial and my mom doesn’t remember what happened to it. I recently moved to the country and I feel like I’m losing my sanity and I also found a lump in my forearm no scar went to dr. and they said to leave it alone?? My issue is the grey touched Mums breast and granddaddy’s chest and I specifically recall a grey touching my forehead with one long skinny finger to put me back under?",2011-01-05T00:00:00,,

It’s a couple of miles to S. Jack Tone road. In the distance, slightly to my left, where two bright lights, the lights where North/South, looked to be about over S. Jack Tone road, hovering. Continuing East I observed the object to be stationary.  As I approached S. Jack Tone road it began to move West, in a straight line, paralleling French Camp road.  The object, at first, appeared to me dark metallic. I could see angles reflecting from its lights. As it approached suddenly I noted three lights. One light each facing West, North and South. I assumed it to be a Helicopter and slowed down and opened the window to listen. There was no sound. No rotating beacons or strobe lights like all aircraft have. The object was around 100 feet gliding over an orchard.  As we passed I could see it was large and possibly triangular. On the East end was a dull red object.  After we had passed the lights appeared to be on the bottom.  It accelerated west as I had already slowed to observe it. From the westbound lane to the edge of the orchard must be less than 500 feet.  I had my head turned back to watch it but had the Jack Tone road stop sign. In retrospect, I feel it was a UFO.   An airport KSCK is North/West from the sighting.  I looked at Flight aware and it showed an Allegiant Air MD88 landing at 1936.  Once turned South on Jack Tone road I looked at the radio clock it was 1938.  I don’t see how an MD88 could be that low and off course on a clear night. Also no engine sound or any sound at all from my observation.  If was larger than an Ultralight or Helicopter.  The size seemed to vary as it passed which does make be believe it was triangular. There was a vehicle behind me that I noticed was right on my bumper from my slowing.  A couple of cars had passed North/South on S. Jack Tone road. Nobody seemed to take notice or slow to look. Observer:  I am a truck driver near 20 years and have seen many things at night.  Most can be explained.  Not all, always.  I’m not prone to just assume something is a UFO.  In fact if I had, in this case, I could have had video with my phone. A lot of where I drive is around orchards. I’ve seen Helicopters spraying at night.  There are odd implements working at night and many lights, in the sky, that turn out to be airplanes.  Shooting Stars and oddly illuminated clouds and cloud formations. In fact, I have seen a Cigar shaped UFO back in the early ’90s with my brother as a witness.  I didn’t know of any places to make a report back then.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,37.7416,-121.1244

I observed a bright object in the sky traveling erratically.  90 seconds,Livermore,CA,2010-10-14T21:25:00,light,90 seconds,"Occurred : 10/14/2010 21:25  (Entered as : 101410 21:25) Reported: 10/16/2010 7:50:44 PM 19:50 Posted: 11/21/2010 Location: Livermore, CA Shape: Light Duration:90 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78416.html,"I observed a bright object in the sky traveling erratically.  90 seconds Details. On the night of 14 October 2010 I observed an unusual object in the sky.  I have been an amateur astronomer for over 40 years and had setup my 8-inch Newtonian reflector telescope for viewing the night sky.  After aligning my telescope with the polar axis, I started to observe the night sky (it was a clear night for viewing). I had already observed the planet Jupiter and the first quarter moon when I decided to train my telescope on the celestial object M-31 (the galaxy in the constellation Andromeda). As I moved my telescope toward the area of M-31 I noticed a brief flash of light near the star Beta Andromedae.  At first, I thought I had caught a glimpse of a meteor, however, a few seconds later the object reappeared near the northeast corner of the “Great Square” of Pegasus.  When it reappeared it was moving in a southern direction. I was going to change my assessment that this bright object was probably a satellite, but I then noticed it had a reddish-copper like halo around it. I then noted the time on my watch as 21:25. Location and Description of Object.  At this time of year in northern California, the constellations Andromeda and Pegasus are approximately 45 to 50 degrees above the northeastern horizon.  The object itself appeared to be a white star in appearance.  The halo was about the same brightness and was the size of a dime (if you held a dime in your hand and fully extended your arm).  As I will mention later this object varied in brightness. In astronomical terms it changed from between a magnitude 1.5 down to a magnitude of 4.0.  The object also faded away (or disappeared) a total of three times. Movement and Behavior of Object.  As this object moved south, it appeared to be behaving like a satellite.  However, the object made a “loop” in the sky.  The best way to describe objects movement is imaging drawing a straight line then writing a small letter “L” and then continuing the line for a short distance.  The loop would be the size of my thumb when held at arm’s length. After the object looped it dimmed briefly for a few seconds but then got brighter again.  This is when it made sudden move south through Pegasus at high speed and made a another “loop” before stopping and fading from view near the ecliptic just east of Jupiter (this rapid movement occurred in just two to three seconds).  After another few seconds, the object reappeared and continued south at the pace of a satellite.  But once again, as it neared the star Fomalhaut in the southern hemisphere, it made another loop and dimmed again from view.  It would reappear one more time and head south and I would lose the object  in the sky glow near the southern horizon.  I looked at my watch and it flipped from 21:26 to 21:27.  So the length of the event I estimate to be between 60 to 90 seconds. Conclusion. The only way I can relate the object to anything else is it looked like a moving “ring-type” nebula.  As I mentioned before I have an amateur astronomer for over 40 years and have never see anything like this. I you have an explanation to what I saw I would enjoy hearing it.  I hope this information helps.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,37.61887877906977,-121.62196104651161

On Oct. 14/2010 @ aprox. 22:05hrs. I noticed two objects coming from the north, traveling parallel with each other aprox. ½-inch apart as viewed in the night sky, in the area of the big dipper, moving south toward the moon.    As I watched, I noticed there was a third object in front of the first two, approximately three inches in front of them.  All three objects were moving at the same rate of speed until they reached directly over head of me.  Then the western most object of the two rear objects, pulled ahead of the eastern most object, accelerated, then dropped back.  It did this five times while I observed them.  They continued on at a very high rate of speed & I lost sight of them as they approached the moon’s glare. I called the airport & talked airport authority, told him what I saw, and asked if he could call the tower & see if air traffic control had seen anything weird on their radar.  When he came back on line he said they hadn’t seen anything on radar & gave me your phone # to report it. The objects were moving with the speed of a satellite re-entering earth orbit on burn up. Very fast!! It took only about 20 seconds to cover a huge portion of the sky.  I would estimate their altitude @ over 30,000 feet.  I realize it’s hard to approximate altitude @ night, but they seemed very high. Description of the objects is as follows, they had a brownish / copper color nucleus in the center, almost square shaped with a weak halo encircling them.  The scale of the halo would be the same size if you placed a dime over top of  Jupiter in the night sky.  The color is what made me notice them, they seemed darker than the night sky and were blocking out starlight as they came toward me.  The halo was a perfect sphere with a very pale bluish, white light to it, almost transparent.  The intensity of the object never changed, but the clarity of my view improved as they went directly overhead of me. The size is as stated previously, approximately Jupiter sized object as viewed in the night sky, with the halo extending approximately the size of dime if laid over Jupiter. I am a amateur astronomer, with a 12"" Mead LX200 scope.  I was out in the night sky since dusk & my eyes had adapted to the low light. Unfortunately I did not get the chance to put the scope on the objects as they were moving very fast & I just was too excited & didn’t want to miss what I was seeing or lose them in the night sky.   I have view comets, chased satellites with my naked eye & scope.  Spent countless hours observing the stars & sky’s at night and never have seen anything like this before.  The thing that really got me was when the one object accelerated & dropped back several times, nothing in the night sky does that!!   I have lived by the airport for 11 years & observed all kinds of aircraft @ night, it definitely was not any type of aircraft.   I did think it was a satellite until I noticed the second object & then a third object which led me to the realization that they were U.F.O.’S!!!!

I noticed what I thought was a star,low but motionless, flickering brilliant colors of green, blue and white. In awww, I stayed focused on this ""star."" My opinion changed once I noticed this light was swaying slowly back and forth, low enough to be obscurred by the parking lot's lamp post. I felt as if it knew I could see it, because as I would follow it, it would move slowly back behind the lamp post's cover at an angle that I would have to change constantly to keep spotting it. I thought for a second, ""I really need somebody else to see this with me,"" I stepped back in, ran up the stairs and awoke my girlfriend in panic to go see. She got up, got dressed and came out. I pointed at it and it was in the same little area I spotted it at, low but dead still. She seemed sort of mad because it could easily be mi! staken as a ""star."" I told her to focus on it and after a minute of watching this thing it surely started moving slowly back and forth again. I asked what she thought about it and she replied sort of confused. She then said, ""look it moved more towards the right,"" then instantly this light stopped in place, lifted a little and then completely disappeared. She asked ""Did it just disappear?"" I didn't know what to say, I wanted to think it didn't disappear but it did and I felt like falling over literally. What I had seen wasn't man-made at all because of its behavior. The flickering of the lights of green, blue and white and sometimes dimming for a second, to its motionless sway and it's elusive movements from my view.

I’ll simply put what I came to know through an experience which can’t be described by words has changed everything. I don’t expect you to believe and, honestly, I don’t even care what you think.  I will never disclose any of my personal information simply because my end of the rope is weaker than the end where a government stands and I still need to pay my bills.  Denial it’s an unbreakable law kept by all means where one’s life value means little or nothing against governments and corporations. Also, I would like to ask your discretion for what I am about to describe will affect the way you see life itself, including religion.  If you truly believe in God, stop reading this.  I wish I had this option myself because once you lose hope, there’s nothing left.  Trust me.   Sometimes, ignorance it’s the best patch to find happiness. I’ll start saying that I’m not American.  This experience has nothing to do with stories about Area 51 or Roosevelt crashes.  I’ve been in 29 countries around the world and speak 5 languages and I work with computers (I will not disclosure my profession). The year is 1999.  Just another Friday night under a beautiful sky, around 2am.  Location: North Japan. Life in Japan is really stressful.  It’s normal to work more than 12 hours a day (at least in my branch).  It’s very different from western countries where people socialize with their neighbors and have a social life.  In Japan, you socialize at work and with family and one’s circle of friends are those people from school times.  Kind of weird but that’s how most people live their lives in that island. So, the most common question: - Were you there alone?   Yes, unfortunately. What were you doing there?   Relaxing. At 2 am?  Many people (like myself) go shopping at the supermarket 2~3am.  It’s normal in north Japan. Does the government know about the incident?   Hell yeah, I saw 2 F-16s trying to catch up before we left, probably from the American military base in Misawa, 15 to 20 miles from where I was. What you mean ""we?""  Keep reading. I was at the beach on a city Momoishi.  It’s an industrial park that has a long walk patch where you stand 5 to 6 meters above sea level.  This patch was actually built to break waves brought by tsunamis and high waves formed by a typhoon that hits Japan very often. Walking along the patch, the only source of light is the stars and the moon.  If you ever went to a place where there are no cities around, you’ll know what I mean.  The sky shines in a way that it’s impossible to see on the cities.  That goes without talking about the fresh air from the ocean blowing smooth on the hot summer.  Just perfect.  I did that a lot before that faithful day. I walked about 3 miles along the coast before I spotted a bright light coming from the hoods.  I thought it was just young people parted in one of the many parking spots along the cost with their Xenon’s headlights.  In Japan it’s pretty common and affordable to have a custom car, just like you probably saw on movies.  I didn’t really pay too much attention.  Actually, it has kind like blurring my vision because when you walk in the dark and suddenly you see light, your eyes take some time to adapt and you go almost blind when trying to see dark spots again.  So I kept on moving carefully, watching out where I was walking.  I wanted to walk faster so I could kept appreciating the beautiful, quiet and peaceful night but I heard a ""boom"" coming from the light. It was so dammed laud that I thought it was an explosion of some kind.  It scared me to death just like when somebody plays a trick on you.  I looked back and saw that, once bright white light had moved vertically and now has changing colors.  I thought to myself that maybe it was because I was half mile away so it was just a optical trip but I discarded this option because I was the one already at 5 to 6 meters above the sea level walking the patch and I that car supposed to be at least at the same level as I was, not above.  Despise me been blinded again because of the light, I started to run back on the light’s direction.  Maybe someone needed help.  I took my mobile to call the cops.  It was working but it was completely useless. Everything had vanished, including the OS. No line, nothing worked besides the backlight.  That’s when I stop running a got scared.  I got really scared.  I know that takes a great deal to an electronic device to be how to call it, ""erased?""   And of course, all those stories that you heard about thieves, monsters, and ghosts start flooding your mind and you just get in high alert like your life is in danger or something.  I can’t even describe the feeling.  The air becomes heavy, hard to breath and you just want to get out of there.  I started to run again, blinded by the light.  Of course, the worst happened. I feel from the patch.  Blinded and now hurt, that was the worst that could happen. At first, I didn’t realize how bad I got hurt.  I was trying to find a way to climb back and run to my car and go home. Where I was, there is a small forest between the beach and the patch.  The trees are spaced and almost no ground vegetation.  Depends how is your mood, it can look beautiful or r! eally scary. I stood up back on my feet but when I looked forward, no more that 10 meters away, that small guy with his huge head has staring at me.  My legs gave up on me at the very same moment. I was shaking so much that I couldn’t even screen for help.  Thinking about it now, I am not half of the man I thought I was.  It’s embarrassing and pathetic. My eyes were starting to get used to the environment.  That’s when I saw a second individual behind the first one, between 2 trees about 25 meters.  If you ask me what I was thinking at that time, I would say: - I don’t. I wasn’t able to hold even one thought in my mind or make reason of the situation I was in but I was well aware that it was an encounter. I heard a lot of stories about abducted people and crops.  I always thought that it would be nice if were true but for me, it was nothing but a good story.  But now days I think to myself: those were really brave people that were capable to make a reason of the situation and analyze the circumstances or it’s a complete hoax.  Either way, I never thought that my body and mind would give up on me so bad. The worst part for me was the staring.  Those big ""black shiny"" eyes were so indifferent, so cold,...I can’t explain.  One thing I know for sure.  Those eyes saw right through me. I tell you why. I don’t really know how long it took until I heard a voice saying:  Come down now! My head has steady facing those individuals at all times like a cat hunting a mouse.  My full attention was to those two standing before me but I didn’t saw no lip moving.  I looked around real quick and I heard again:  No harm will come to you.  Come down now.  That’s when I realize that the voice was I my head. Without even realize, I start putting some order in my thoughts.  My shock state has start been replaced by reason.  Until this point, my head was a mess.  I can’t tell how long time had passed since I first spot the first individual and I didn’t paid attention at all on the light anymore.  I felt like if I took my eyes off the subject something bad would happen to me.  Slowly, I stood up and took a defense position. I start to look around for places where I could run.  My legs stopped shaking but my shoulder and hand were killing me. I look at my hand and I saw a lot of blood.  I cut my hand deep when I felt and also mess up my shoulder. I tried to stop the bleeding by holding the cut with my other hand.  While I was attending my hand I heard the voice again:  No harm will come to you.  Until that point I haven’t replied a word but this time I asked: what you want from me?  The voice replied: To teach. I never knew if just one of them were talking to me or both.  The voice was always the same tone.  It never changed. The following is a series of questions and answers that followed my first reply:  Me (after a short moment of reflection, I said -always using my own voice-): I  do not understand and I am scared to death.  What do you want to teach me?  Voice:   No harm will come to you. I am here to answer your questions.  I am here to show you our ways. I couldn’t think of anything to ask besides what regards my safety and situation.  Then I asked: Me: If you mean no harm to me, can I go home now?  Voice: I am no more alien to you that you are to me. I am here to help you.  To guide you.  I cannot force you to see what I want to show you. In that very moment, the second individual backed up and disappeared in the dark.  The one standing in front of me took a few steps back.  A heavy silence stroke the air. I asked:  Me:  What will happen to me if I choose to see what you want to show me?  Voice: No harm will come to you.  I will show you our way.  I will guide you. Me:  Will I be allowed to go home after that? Voice: Yes. At the same moment, the second individual appeared and joined the first one. I looked around again hoping that somebody would show up…the voice said: This way. As they turned around and started walking deep in the hoods heading to the light’s direction, I could clearly see for the first time the anatomy of those individuals. Unlike us, it seems that they try to balance the head while walking which gave me the impression that they push the neck back and direct the head down in order to look straight. It looks creepy. We walked 300 meters (approximately) towards the light. I avoided looking up because I didn’t want to be blinded and lose sight of my surroundings. There was a platform like thing ahead. I hesitated. The two individuals stepped on the platform and turned to me. I headed: This way. My story begins here. Before I start I must state that I don’t really care what you think my story it’s a lie or true. I still have my life to take care, my bills to pay, my reputation as professional to keep and a social life to attend.  I won’t compromise my life to satisfy your ego or curiosity. It’s for you to decide what to believe. It’s for you to decide how to deal with what I’m about to tell you. We live our lives based on what we think it’s true and based on our own sense of justice. Because of that, we rage wars against whatever contradicts what we think its right. What if your truth it’s an illusion created to deceive you, to control what you think? I put all these conflicts behind and now I’m just trying to have a good life and enjoy every second of it. I truly don’t care if people kill each other over oil, money or whatever because, in my opinion, we are a no more than a cancer for this planet. We are not even able to understand each other and organize like cancer cells does. That put us lower as viruses. How pathetic. Anyway, my opinion counts for nothing and that’s not why you are reading this so let’s move on. I walked into the platform keeping my distance from those individuals. I guess they were prepared or experienced of dealing with primitive civilizations such as ours (comparing to theirs). There was in no moment pressure or treat on their part against me but I could tell that they didn’t trust me too which is completely understandable. he platform started lifting toward the light. As we approached, I could see the craft’s “belly”. It has triangle shape, dark colored (maybe because was night), and the strong lights were coming from something that looked like half spheres placed along the corners plus one right above us. Unlike the lights on the corners, the light above us was like blue neon but not strong enough to blind the eyes. Actually, that particular light didn’t affect my eyes at all. We float into the air for about 20 to 30 meters, just above the tree top. Once we got onboard, the blue light faded until shut complete off. The first thing I saw was one more individual standing on the edge of the platform, just like it was waiting for our arrival. I started to shake again thinking to myself how stupid I was for been there. At the same moment I heard the voice saying: No harm will come to you. That’s when I realized that they could listen to my thoughts. I asked them how come they could go into my head and talk to me. They answer that they can’t communicate with me if I choose not to listen. It said that nothing can be imposed. The following sentence was: This way. The compartment we arrived was rounded and the walls were just dark. There were 2 entrances in front of me and a bigger on the other side. They the 2 entrances had no doors but the bigger one was closed with the same material as the wall. I could tell it was a door because of the void in the wall. I don’t know for sure though. We took the right entrance. Two of them in front of me and one on my back. I’ve never felt so uncomfortable on my entire life. In this corridor, we passed through 3 other entrances closed by similar material as the wall. There were no symbols of ornaments anywhere. By this time, my body was hurting so much and my hand kept bleeding. I was really tired. We enter a room which has a table like thing which I was asked to sit. Two of them entered the room along with me but one of them followed the corridor. One of them took my hand and pointed a pen like instrument towards my wound. I felt like getting an electrical shock so I pulled my hand away. As I looked at my wound cleaning the blood using my shirt, it was fully closed and a small scar replaced the wound. I was amazed. Once more, it pointed the instrument on my shoulder and the pain was gone (after the shock, of course). As it returned the instrument to its original position, I heard: This way. I stood up fully recovered. I was no longer tired plus I felt my body was lighter. As I followed the two individuals, I came to realize that they also no longer had trouble walking. My conclusion was that the craft environment provides a lower gravity allowing the body to waste less energy. Again, this was my conclusion. All of them looked exactly the same just like a copy of each other. They were wearing metal like filters although I don’t think it was metal. We went out of the room back to the corridor. After 3 entrances closed by doors, we turned left which leaded to another corridor. This time, it wasn’t so dark. I could see some sort of device on the left wall spreading to its entire length. It had some small blinking lights on it but nothing fancy. I didn’t count how many doors we passed by for I was looking the device on the other side of the wall but the corridor lead to a wider room where another 2 individuals were sitting on something like chairs. There were control panels on the front wall which was rounded in just one side. The panels where transparent and full of symbols draw by light, very different of our standard monitors. Their hand movements were always slow. My best guess it that they don’t used their bodies randomly like we do by making sports or other activities. Every time they talked to me, there were no movements at all. No gestures or lip moving, nothing at all. Suddenly, the wall and floor became transparent like glass. I was able to see the moon and the city’s lights below us. That’s when I realize that the craft’s position had changed and we were no longer at the beach and no longer at low altitude. I didn’t felt a thing. As we slowly flew across the city below (I think it was Hachinohe but it’s impossible to tell), something happened. The two individuals sitting on their chairs pointed to dots of light on the east pin-pointed at the wall. The view just zoomed like you zoom your video camera but in high quality image. I recognized by shape two F-16s approaching fast. The image zoomed back to normal then suddenly, all the wall images faded into a dark blue and soon into black with bright dots everywhere. It took less than 2 seconds.  We were in space!  My perplexity was broken by the voice saying: Listen carefully for you are in danger. I took a second to react. I was about to ask it how come but it starts its speech: -	The universe is a cycle of life.  Life is re-engineered at the end of each cycle. During each cycle, new species are created and develop conscience but at the end of the cycle, those consciences are destroyed to allow new species and conscious to rise. Only those species capable of organizing and learn will be allowed to go through the next cycle. My specie was allowed to continue through the next cycle by understanding the rules of the universe and its compositions. You are not prepared to continue through the next cycle. You will be destroyed. I was shocked. Those bastards lied to me by telling me “no harm will come to you”. I felt anger and I hated myself for been so stupid. Then I said: - I thought that no harm will come to me. That’s why I am here. To learn. Not to be destroyed! The voice continued: -	Our mission it’s to find species capable of communication and teach them the rules of the universe. No harm will come to you. That’s when I realized that it was referring me as a human been, not as individual. My head exploded with questions but it continued. Throughout time, we came to you to teach and to guide. We showed you how the universe works and teach about the stars. We send one of our own throughout time in order to live among you and teach our ways. And yet, you still fail to understand. I interrupted it by asking how come I never heard of another species teachings on my planet. It replies: -	We sent one of our own through one of your vessels. A vessel is no more than a transport as machines are a way to enhance the vessel. I interrupted it again by asking:  - Why am I in danger? Why telling me this? What can I do? -	The end of the cycle has come. We will help those who have learn our ways as we did to those we teach how to build. No harm will come to those who are willing to understand and learn. A few seconds were filled by silence. Then I ask: - Even if I am aware of this, what difference could I possible make?  Who will believe my story?  Why can’t you land your craft before the crowds and make your point yourself? -	Nothing can be imposing. We have a pact with your species that allow us to contact you individually but not public in exchange of technology. We will no longer come back until the cycle ends. When it does, we will help those who can be saved. No harm will come to you. My interest of their technology or the craft itself disappeared completely.  It wouldn’t even reply all my questions properly. Without even realizing what’s were going around me, I looked to the wall and I saw city lights. We were on Earth again. I heard: This way. We walked back to the corridor, just back to the rounded room where we arrived. I was dropped 30 km away from where my car was parked. My clock has dead, my mobile dead but I had money enough to take a cab. I never spoke a word about what happen that night and I never went back to that beach alone again, especially at night time. This is my story.  Feel free to discard or do publish it but do not try to locate or contact me in any way.  I will not discuss this in public.

I was getting into van to pick-up daughter from dance classes.  I just entered vehicle and was getting ready to start van and observed a bright flash hit the window.  I thought, I had blow car battery or some electrical problem.  I leaned forward and saw an object threw van window. I observed object for a few seconds and exited van.  The object was dark or black and had a rectangular shape. I estimated from a lamppost nearby that the object was about 80 ft above me. It was sort of a large trunk like shape.  It had multicolored lights that were at the ends of what look like rods that projected out from the structure of ship, like needles in a pincushion.  It was about three medium- car lengths long and about two car lengths wide.  It did not emit any sound.  I walked to a parking lot next to my driveway and that object was motionless for about 5 seconds.  The object begin to move in a southeast direction slowly and then made a turn to the northeast and began to rise.  I moved to follow it and went to corner of street and major intersection.  I looked up and down street to see if anyone else was able to see object.  I did not see any persons or vehicles in the area it was very quiet. It then began to move and suddenly seemed to stretch out and then disap! peared from my view into what was northeast direction,  After incident, I went back to my van and attempted to start engine but it would not start and the following day or days I removed battery and took it to nearby car radio and video shop.  The shop guy stated that battery was blow and he noted that battery cables were fused when he returned with new battery to replace blown battery. This craft was beautiful and seemed to just float and move with little effort.  The effect of it stretching out was like observing in going into a tunnel and then it was gone.

It was hovering in the sky, barely moving, and it must have been relatively low because it appeared fairly large. Then about 8 seconds after I spotted the object, it shot off into the sky with a flash of light and disappeared. It made a sort of zig-zag maneuver, in the shape of an ""S"" or a ""Z"", as it flew away.  It was moving so quickly that it was gone within a second and all I could see was a faint light trail.

I told my kids to look up at the sky, but they were busy skateboarding and had no interest. Here’s where it gets weird, one of the objects dropped a large dull grey metallic egg shaped object from a hatch underneath. I thought it was a bomb, and I waited in fear for an explosion which never occurred. The 3 flying objects disappeared from my sight as they seemed to be flying east, following the coastline of Long Islands North shore. I live only several miles from the Long Island Sound, and I believe that the egg shaped object was deliberately dropped into the water. I have searched the internet to see if anyone else saw this, and I’ve never found any reports.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,40.8393,-73.2797

Two people see UFO hovering at a distance of 10 feet.,Peoria,IL,1997-06-15T01:00:00,disk,3 minutes,"Occurred : 6/15/1997 01:00  (Entered as : 06/15/97 1:00) Reported: 7/31/2010 12:23:22 PM 12:23 Posted: 8/24/2010 Location: Peoria, IL Shape: Disk Duration:3 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76907.html,"Two people see UFO hovering at a distance of 10 feet. I heard Peter Davenport on the 07-29-10 episode of Coast to Coast AM and decided to submit my story. Headline: UFO at a stone's throw  This story takes place in 1992 in Illinois. My friend and I were parked facing north at night in the summer on a small concrete bridge over a small creek in rural Illinois.  We were not quite ready to go home and wanted to continue our conversation about ""girlfriends.""  The weather was cloudy and misty.  We could see sheet lighting in the distance.  My car windows had droplets of water on them.  I sat in the driver's seat, my friend sat in the passenger's seat of my Ford Escort. The creek bridge had cement guardrails that were almost perfectly level with where the car windows started.  I suspect this was a purposeful choice by the architect. The road continued on north to a T-section about 1/4 down the road.  Beyond that intersection was a large hill that spanned for miles in each direction.  Approach to the creek bridge was as if going down a slight hill, and the incline continued on for awhile and then began sloping up again toward the T-section.  We were of a slightly higher altitude than the cornfields directly to the left and right front of us that bordered the creek.  The border of the creek was a slight hill that blocked view of the field beyond to our right (2 o'clock).  Over our right shoulders at about 4 o'clock (direction), was four-story tall mound/hill left over from an old gravel pit that had trees and brush all over it.  This mound followed the other creek border for about a half a mile to the east. So from our perspective, we could not see the field to our right front, nor see beyond over the hill over our right shoulders.  The creek was essentially bordered on both sides with land that stretched out as far as the eye could see.  It was here that we watched the lighting in the distance.   I could see the lightening from tens of miles away over the top of the distant hills, but there was additional light coming from closer up.  At first I just dismissed it as ball lighting, but I could see the light illuminating the mist just above the hill.  I could not see into the field where the light seemed to be coming from, just the effects of the light on the trees on the border of the creek.  I stopped my friend from talking and said, ""Friend, why is that lightening going on and off with a beat.  Nature is not that exact.""  I began snapping my fingers to the rate of the light from the field going on and off.  On, snap, off, snap.  It was a perfect beat (I am a musician).  I tol! d my friend to roll down his window and just as the window rolled down, a craft popped out from behind the hill.  It was level with us, and we were approximately at most 10 ft from the craft.  I could have easily jumped on top of the craft from the side of the bridge without straining myself. I was speechless.  At the time I was morally opposed to the idea of alien spacecraft.  My family were strict Christians who specifically were taught at our denomination that humans on Earth were the only organic life in the universe.  I was 100% against the ideas of aliens existing.  Yet, here before me and my friend was this totally silent craft, about the size of a large SUV, hovering, silently. I broke the silence by startling loudly, ""THAT IS NOT A UFO!""  At the time that I said that, the craft was just a little past us.  The craft was almost directly to our right, but a little farther past us at that point.  It abruptly changed course (as if it heard me) and either turned off its lights, put on a cloaking device or did something else because it seemed to just go right into the opposite hill, but more likely it just went ""dark.""  I revved up my engine and drove away very fast.  My perspective on everything had just come crashing down in one fell swoop of time no more than 3 minutes long. I got to my house, where my friend's car was, and he asked me to follow him back home (because he was too freaked out to go over that bridge alone).  So I followed him home.  By the time I got back to the bridge, my fear had gone down, and I was filled with wonder.  The storm had passed, so I parked on the bridge again alone, turned on a Cure CD and sat Indian style on the roof of my car, searching the landscape and the sky for anything out of the ordinary. Nothing.  Silence. Oddly, it was from that moment on that I started to experience the phenomenon known as ""synchronicity.""  As I drove back to my house that night, I though, ""what if when I get home my family has been abducted!""  I got home and went to my parent's bedroom and listened for breathing.  Nothing, so I turned on the light and the bed was empty and made, at like 2 a.m.!  I ran to my sister's rooms and they were all empty too.  I was freaked out so I just collapsed in bed, thinking in the morning this will all be resolved. I awoke to a call from my mother that the family left town unexpectedly that evening to visit relatives. Description of the craft:  Closure took over in my perception of the craft, so my brain processed the craft as looking like the time machine in Back to the Future (big fan at the time).  It was the only way my brain could process a floating silent vehicle, that and it also did look a lot like that craft.  It had a metallic brushed reflective surface, with an area like a car where the ""people"" were transported, and then a front and back section much like our engine and trunk section.  It as the classic saucer shape, but without the dramatic flaring sides.   It had lights in various places on the exterior but it all happened so fast and I was so stunned that I couldn't tell you the exact placement, but my friend who had no such ""stunned"" effect because he was already a believer, said he saw lights in the back, front, top and bottom of the craft. For now, any contact, I would prefer it to be done via email. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident in 1992 is approximate.  PD))",2010-08-24T00:00:00,40.73239708939709,-89.61464490644491

The light was too bright to be a helicopter. I hovered for a bit then moved back and forth. After it became obscured by sme trees I could not see the object again. I arrived home and told my fiance what I had seen. She said that earlier in the night around 10pm she had spotted a similar object in Arcadia.

I witnessed from the west a white flatish like object very high, extreme white colour with no light. Shape appeared rounded with a slow floating action with a slight lift on one side and also as if it was slightly changing shape.  I rounded up 4 witnesses, 3 observed in disbelief while the fourth said it was a plastic white bag.  Wind was happening, as you can see flying fluffy seeds moving at a good speed from south to north.  This object hang stationary in the sky coming from the west to east for at least 15 minutes, than turn north into clouds.  Can plastic white bags create their own direction?  Height I would estimate was 10-20,000 feet.  (Do plastic white bags fly that high?)  Binoculars were used and this object appeared strange quite strange.

I'm really sorry I don't have pictures and even if I did, you would not get much of a picture because of the high altitude.  It does feel good to have witnesses because seeing is believing.

I was on a Boy Scout trip when I saw the UFO. We made camp at Camp Crooked Creek, located near Ft. Knox. When the rest of the troop went to bed, I stayed up and made a fire, along with a fellow Scout. At around midnight when the fire had died down to embers is when we saw the UFO. I remember everything around me flashed in a blue light, exactly the same flash a camera would make (the same amount of time too). Both of us exclaimed ""whoa,"" because it was not only shocking but appeared to come from above us. We both instinctively looked up. About 250-300 yards above me, I made out three dim lights ( in a triangular position). I could barely make out the dark outline of an aircraft, it appeared to be in the shape of a triangle as well. If it didn't have lights on the bottom, i don't think I would have been able to see it. It was not moving, it just hovered above us. About 5 seconds went by, and then it shot across the sky towards the horizon. It looked just like a shooting star, with the trailing light following behind it. I remember expecting to hear a huge roar of an engine, but it made no sound at all. My immediate reaction was that it had to have been a fighter jet, because we were so close to Ft. Knox. But, I quickly ruled that out, because, what explains the flash?  The flash was targeted right at us. The whole place didn't flash, just the small area around myself and my friend. Also, what plane can hover like that? A Harrier Jet can hover, but this object was only 250-300 yards directly above us and made no noise. Also, there is no plane that can move that fast. It had gone past the horizon in a fraction of a second without making any noise. That's what convinced me that this was no plane, missile, or anything man made. We woke a few of the older Scouts and told them what happened, but no one took us seriously, as has been the case whenever I bring up the story. I know what I saw, and the fact that someone else was with me, and was able to recount exactly the same thing I saw, makes me truly believe that we encountered a UFO. Why didn't I go to the media if I was so sure? Because I knew there was no way of proving it, and this culture seems to dismiss anyone who believes in UFO's. But, I needed to get this off my chest.

I was a fence line detail and paused for a few minutes to stretch my legs and was watching the flight corridor to SEATAC.  I noticed an airliner coming into view and then noticed a very fast approaching aircraft approaching the corridor from the southeast at about the same altitude.   I at first thought it could have been a private jet just coming into the corridor to line up for approach to SEATAC.  As this situation progressed I figured the fast approaching aircraft would bleed off speed and fall in line. But as I watched I noticed no active beacon or navs and thought it a little weird that this thing would already have his approach lights on.  The craft entered the corridor and at this point continuing his northwest heading at a very high rate of speed and what appeared to be the same altitude and as the situation progressed appeared to be on a collision course with the airli! ner.   As I was watching a pit began to grow in my stomach thinking “oh no this might be a bad deal.”   The craft continued its heading and it appeared they were going to make physical contact.  The craft narrowly missed the airliner’s tail section (I am estimating because of regulation altitude per FAA standards) was about a 1/8th of a mile.  The thought crossed my mind that this may be an intercept mission by the Air Force and was engaging the airliner.  The craft then banked hard left, same rate of speed coming along side then accelerated banking hard left again this time at an impossible angle of attack cutting in front of the airliner then moved to left wing of the airliner then came to an absolute dead stop off the left wing of the airliner.  I watched in amazement as the airliner continued its flight path all the while keeping my eyes locked on the other craft.  Once the airliner was past the other craft dimmed itself to match surrounding stars.  I stood for another 20 minut! es transfixed on the craft. I then began to notice other airli! ners div erting in a northwest arc the first aircraft coming on the scene banking hard right as I believe enroute control diverted them because of the situation.  As this aircraft diverted I tried to keep an eye on the stationary craft.  I waited about 2 minutes then turned to see the location of the airliner which by my estimate was at about the same northwest vector as when the craft  approached the first airliner at.

Although the rain was not heavy, the dark cloud over Lake Erie was distinct. The phenomena observed began as a casual observance of a single speck of light. We observed what appeared from the shoreline as a light perhaps a mile or two offshore. The only way we could observe this occurence was with an average powered pair of field binoculars. At first looking through the binoculars it appeared as if it might be a small boat, but closer examination revealed that this was something ""on fire"". I quickly alerted my companion to look into the binoculars to get his opinion. He also saw this ball of flame. What happened after this first encounter was quite startling. Let me say that I have never had a close encounter and am suspect of anything currently being written about the UFO phenomenology. However the unfolding events of that night have not only startled me, but have stayed with me for the last three years. O! nly today was I able to define my observances based on other eye-witnesses who had similar sightings. They have described what they similarly saw as ""orange flaming orbs"". Other descriptions were ascribed to them, but in my case the ""orange flaming orbs"" fits the description perfectly. I thought that one orb appearance was enough, but what makes this an even more intriguing mystery is that after this first orb disappeared beyond the Lake Erie's horizon line, another one began to fall from the low hanging dark storm cloud. I have read other accounts and descriptions of ""ascending lights"" and fast lateral moving lights but these were not like that at all. We watched as consecutive flaming orbs fell very slowly from the sky and eventually into the water. What is also amazing is how each was orchestrated in its falling velocity (extremely slow-- slower than a parachutist, so we knew this wasn't a nighttime military mission) and also that the intensity of the light stayed consistent-- from the time it appeared coming out of the dark cloud until it hit the water's horizon line. I should note that there were no sounds being emitted and no sounds of jets, airplane or helicopter engines were heard. The fact that it was a drizzling rain (with no lightning, I might add) made it impossible for this to be man-made-- such as what I thought it might be: a summer ""art performance"" by some of the local artists. No one in their right mind would want to be out in this weather on the vastness of Lake Erie. No ot! her lights appeared-- suche as boats or planes. The house we observed all of this from is remote from the city so no street, traffic or building lights could have interfered. As much as I am recreating this story, we unfortunately had no access to good night time cameras or videos, but I would testified unequivocally that this was a phenomena that deserved a full and further investigation. To continue with the observation, we stood on the back porch with a full panoramic view to the west toward Cleveland and to the east toward Buffalo. We were facing north toward Canada when these lights were observed. In the same fashion as described earlier, we observed at least 16 of these same flaming orbs extremely slowly fall from the sky and into the waters. As each one disappeared the next one began to come out from the underside of the cloud. This event went on for at least one hour. There were more that continued to fall and perhaps a whole string of them from our line of sight and down toward Buffalo, but I actually felt frightened (amazed and excited as well) and wanted to report this occurance to the Lawrence Park police, but being a skeptic and resp! ectful of this tiny suburb and being late at night I hesitated to call anyone to bring undo attention to the neighborhood. I looked in the Erie Times News the next day to see if there was a story about this light phenomena, but did not find anything, nor was there anything on the television. This event has stayed with me since 2007. It is only today that I found your reporting website and also found better descriptors based on other observances.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,42.09974517647059,-80.07763388235293

All were bright white on top from the sun light.  They didn’t appear to be real high in the atmosphere, maybe only a mile high, and were moving in a North Eastern direction at about 20 to 30 miles an hour.  I was sitting on the ground in my backyard watching my children play.  I was also admiring how beautiful the sky looked.  Then, I saw these two very large clouds moving along at the same speed as the rest of the clouds.  They both appeared to look very similar in size and shape.  The one was a little behind the other and further away in the distance.  All of the sudden a silvery white, cigar shaped object, from my perspective because it could have also been the side shot of a saucer shaped UFO, accelerated out of the front of the large cloud closest to me.  It came out of the cloud about the same distance as it was long. ! My estimate was that it must have been around 1000 feet long.  It slowed down very quickly, and then it moved back into the cloud in reverse at the same speed that it came out of the cloud.  This process lasted about a few seconds.  At first I thought it was a blimp, but it had windows with sunlight glimmering of them above and below the middle axis, and it didn’t have a cockpit on the bottom, nor did it have fins in the back to steer it.  Then, I looked at it front, and it didn’t appear to look any different from the back.  There were no tails fins or wings or anything that resembled engines anywhere on the object.  By the size and distance of it from me, I should have also heard the sound of an engine, but it was silent.  I waited to see if it would come back out of the cloud, but I didn’t.  Then, it occurred to me that the other cloud may have had a UFO in it as well because it looked very much like the one that the UFO came out of and it seemed to be riding along side ! of it.  Even today I always keep my eye out in that direction ! of my ya rd on semi-cloudy days to hopefully spot another UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Approximately 8:30 pm, November 8th, 2007 I was sitting on my back yard patio, just outside the sliding back yard glass door. My wife was sitting just inside the glass door, sitting on the couch in her white nightly robe, and doing a cross word puzzle.  We were only about 10 feet from each other.  I was sitting facing my southern back yard brick wall that was approximately 60 feet from me, with the back of my neighbor’s home on the other side of the wall approximately 120 feet from me. Both of our homes were single story family homes in east Mesa Arizona. Each home was approximately 60 feet in width.  I was just sitting there relaxing and everything was very quiet when I suddenly saw some lights that looked like professional football stadium lights, only in a single row (not 2 rows), very slowly rising from in front of my neighbor’s home until they were exposed barely over the home’s roof.  The lights, in length, were looking to be about 10 feet past the west side of the home and about 30 feet past the east side of the home. This made the light fixture look to be about 100 feet in length and there looked to be about 10 lights, running horizontally. The light fixture looked to be about 6 feet in bottom to top height.  The lights were directly facing North, and my home.  My first reaction was that I was smiling a little and wondering what my neighbor was doing rising up lights like that, that were very large, at this time of night. That changed when I suddenly realized that the lights were now barely over the peak of my neighbor’s roof and very slowly moving over it toward my home.  Seeing this my next reaction, as I still sat in my chair, was that I realized the lights I was seeing were not on a pole, they were airborne, very low, and moving very slowly towards my home, with absolutely no sound.  It was then that I immediately stopped thinking about my neighbor.  When the lights had slowly passed over my neighbor’s home and were now over my back yard approaching my home, I stood up and walked off the patio and into my back yard as the lights slowly now went over me.  Approximately 2 minutes had passed from the time I first saw the lights. As I looked up I saw that the area behind the lights was black and suddenly looked like a very dark roof over my yard. It was then that I suddenly saw a red light over the top of me, approximately 6 feet in diameter, with what looked like a glass cover that looked almost like the exterior of a golf ball, although I did not see the red light come on. With the red light on directly over me I noticed that the light was not moving and that the front of the craft was just barely over the roof of my home and the rear of the craft was completely over my yard. It was now obvious that the craft was not moving. It was then that a noise was coming from the craft that was so loud I immediately looked at the ground and covered my ears. It was still very loud. I was immediately thinking that the whole block has to be hearing this and my wife is definitely coming out. The noise sounded like a combination of high wind and a high pitched engine sound. When I looked at the door of my home I did not see my wife coming out. When I saw that I ran to the door, stuck my head in, and told my wife quickly to come out side and see this, not describing what “this” is. She said that she is busy doing Sudoku, a form of cross word puzzle. I told her to come outside and I left the glass door open. The noise was still loud as I watched all of a sudden the red light start to move toward my roof. I ran back to the glass door and yelled at my wife to get outside and see this craft that’s over our home. It was then I was wondering why she could not hear this loud noise. My wife immediately got up and ran out the door meeting me quickly. Everything was completely silent again and I could not see the red light under the craft any more as it moved forward. My wife’s first view of the craft that I was seeing happened when the rear end of the craft was only now about 10 feet in front of us. My wife and I simply watched the rear of the craft move silently and very slowly to the front of our home.  There it stopped. My wife and I simply were silently just standing about 30 feet from the craft. The craft just silently stayed there about 5 to 10 minutes. On the bottom rear of the craft we saw 2 red lights spaced about 10 feet from each other and a craft height of about 6 feet.Then the craft started moving again with no sound and very slowly away from us. The strange thing is I do not, for some reason, remember how it left. My wife says the craft just disappeared. After the craft was gone my wife and I went back to the patio and talked about this event for about ten minutes and then didn’t again for a very long time, not even to our families. I must say that due to the craft being so low I could not see the width of the entire craft and from the rear the front large lights were not even visible. I also believe that the sound I was hearing was just in my head as my wife, even with the door open, did not hear any sound. I also state that there were no neighbors that even came out as the craft was hovering over me for that length of time and making that loud noise or just hovering in front of our home with absolutely no movement nor sound. Total time of this event was approximately 15 minutes. For the 3 years that followed this event I have had: Severe left ear infections and scabs that totally covered my left ear and back of my neck, and at times the left side of my face. Eye problems with swollen and red eye skin. This year my mind stopped remembering names and various things. October 2010 I had brain surgery after a tumor was found in my brain and then removed. It was then that the surgeon said he was not familiar with this kind of tumor and it had to be submitted to be investigated. It is called Glioblastoma Multiforme and I was told that most people die within 14 months which is December 2011 for me. I am not most people. I am sending this because I do wonder why this is killing me at the age of 54, and what is the primary cause my coming death. Doctors do not know why this cancer starts. I wonder about November 8th, 2007. I have told my doctors this and my surgeons. I have worked as a Production Planner for 23 years providing Weapon Systems to the United States Army, Marines, and the Armed Forces of Israel.

My parents, my sister, her fiancé, my cousin and I had just finished watching the 2007 Sugar Bowl at my parent’s house in Belen, MS, a small, unincorporated community not far from Marks, MS. My sister’s fiancé left just after the game ended around 10:45PM Central time. My cousin stayed for another few minutes and then got ready to leave. I walked out to his car with him and we were talking. I happened to look north over the empty field in front of my parent’s house when I noticed a couple of lighted objects that appeared to be hovering not far above the treetops over the woods about a half-mile or so north of the house. I watched them for a minute or so and mentioned the lights to my cousin. We first thought they may have been helicopters or planes, but there was no sound and little movement coming from them. Then! I saw one of them produce a faint beam of light under it. I told my cousin that it sure was strange that we couldn’t hear the helicopter engine. Belen is a very small rural community (population less than 100) and at night, except for occasional cars on Hwy. 316, everything is still and very quiet. I can easily hear a plane or helicopter engine when it is going across the sky. I then noticed a couple of planes in the sky and began to hear their jet engines. They looked totally different from the objects we were seeing. The silent objects we saw appeared to be lighted up very brightly, compared to the navigational lights of the planes we saw in the sky. The objects looked to be a mile or so to our north, and that is why I couldn’t tell anything about their shape at that point. The sky was very clear that night, and you could see all the stars and planes flying around. Belen is only about 75 miles or so from Memphis International Airport, but we could clearly see the differe! nces in the look of the objects that were lined up to the nort! h. After a couple minutes of looking at the objects to the north and commenting on how strange they were, we noticed a very big and bright lighted object to our west/southwest, moving toward the north. It appeared to be no more than 1,000 feet above the ground. These objects had white and (at times) red lights on them, but the lights remained constantly “on.” We went inside and told my parents and sister what we were seeing. They came out and observed them. My Dad said they were back again. He and Mom had been seeing them periodically since February 2006, when he said there were between 50 and 100 of the objects in sight at one point. I had not been around to see them until that January night. They had told me about them before, but I didn’t know what to think of their sightings before seeing them myself. My father, my cousin and I ended up driving toward the lights on a road toward the north. At one point we were no more than ¼ mile away from one of them which was crossing a field ! to our west (left). This was the closest I ever got to one of the objects. It made no sound and it had lights all around it. Looking at it through binoculars, I could make out a disk shape with lights all around it. Most of the lights appeared to me to be white and red. I believe if I had shot at it with my 30.06, I could have hit it, but I didn’t have a rifle with me. That particular object moved on toward the NE slowly and eventually turned off its lights and we couldn’t see it anymore. My Dad said he had tried to follow them before and when he would get into the same area as them, the lights would fade and you couldn’t see it any longer. Dad also said the first time he and Mom saw them, some were making patterns in the sky and moving around a lot, some slow, some very fast. This night, January 3-4, I saw a few of them line up with each other as if they were a column in the sky. Then slowly one of them would start to move out of this “formation.” We watched the objects al! l around Belen for almost 2 hours before they all turned their! lights off and/or moved away. I would estimate that we saw 2-3 dozen silent, lighted objects that night. The most I ever saw in the sky at one time was around a dozen. I have seen these lights, although in smaller numbers, at various times since then. Some were in the same location; some were further west of Belen, toward Jonestown and Clarksdale, MS. There in the Mississippi Delta, the land is almost completely flat, and you can see for miles if you are in an open area (which most of it is). I saw more in the summer of 2007, again on December 22, 2007, the night after my sister got married. We’ve seen more since I got married and have gone back home to visit, usually in the spring and at Christmas time. My parents see them fairly often. Although they have no clue what the objects are, they have come to accept them as a fairly natural part of their lives. My sister saw a few one night in late October when we were home because of my Dad’s surgery. The last time we saw any was last W! ednesday night, December 29, 2010. My wife and I saw two over the same trees to the north of Belen as we came in from visiting my grandmother around 7:30PM. Mom and Dad both said that after the first sightings in February 2006, the clocks in their cars were messed up. We didn’t notice any problems with the car clocks in January 2007, or after any of the other sightings since. My Uncle and Aunt live next door, but my Aunt dismisses what we have all seen as “silent helicopters doing maneuvers.” One of my best friends, who saw some of the lights in December 2007, has several years experience in the National Guard and has studied military aircraft for quite some time. He said these objects don’t look like or move like anything he’s seen before. The main reason I am writing this now is because I want people to know what we have been seeing and that there are some kind of unidentified lighted objects flying around the northern part of the Mississippi Delta on a regular basis.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,34.2711,-90.2907

But who's? In 2007, I was in my backyard talking to my husband, it was late at night.  It’s been my habit to check out the sky, especially since my first sighting in the 60’s.  But this one was totally different from that sighting which occurred sometime between the years of 1967-1969.  I pulled up a chaise lounger and as I got comfortable, something caught my eye on my left side. Do you know how when you’re driving and it’s a very hot day?  Sometimes the road ahead of you in the distance appears as if waves are coming off the road.  The waves are kind of invisible but you can see them almost moving, shimmering.  It’s hard for me to explain. As I looked to my left, I saw a triangular shaped object, if you could call it that.   I say this because there wasn’t a solid object that you could see.  The only way that I know how to describe what I saw that night is to say it was a triangular shaped object and it appeared as if you could see right through it.  The entire triangular shape was moving across the night sky much like an airplane flies across the sky (but not that fast), and it wasn’t flying flat like you’d expect.  It was flying where I could see the entire triangle shape (facing me) so I guess you’d say it was on its side.  The pointed tip was pointed towards the southwest and that was the direction it was flying.  Its flight path would have been from the East to the Southwest.  Under other circumstances, you’d have to be directly under an object to see that it was a triangle shape, and if your level of sight was from the side, it might have appeared to be a flat object,  in other words, it would have lost ! its triangle shape to your view. This object appeared like those shimmering heat waves, so I was able to make out a distinct triangular shape against the clear night sky.  But, I could see stars within the waves.  I don’t know if it was a reflection or if I was seeing them through the object.  I’m surprised that I even saw it at all, but I did.  It was moving at a steady pace and it was in my vision for at least 5 to 10 seconds.  By the time I realized what I was seeing and told my husband to look, it was gone out of my sight and moving towards town where there were more lights and that would have made it almost impossible to see. I don’t know if these sightings are our own government, another countries government or from another planet.  I guess it could even be some rich guy conducting his own experiments.   Maybe one day we’ll all know the answer.  But, I hope it’s a stealth technology of our government because just the thought of it is a little scary and pretty cool indeed.

This evening was a very clear night with no clouds...the stars were out and I also like to look for constellations, aircraft and satellites.  I only know the basic constellations but always look for them.  Aircraft are very obvious ""blinking"" lights flying at consistent slow speeds across the sky.  Satallites are difficult to locate but when one is found, it is a single consistent light that moves across the sky at a consistent speed within the earth's orbit.  We also have emergency helicopters that occassionally come to town...these also have blinking lights, land at the hospital in town and then leave.  These are all ""identified"" flying objects and I am familiar with them.  As I was trolling for walleyes from west to east along the south shore of the lake, I was looking up into the sky.  I noticed a very bright light moving at a very high speed.  It was traveling west as well as an angle toward the ground...but still very high in the sky.  I was amazed at how fast it was going...20 to 30 times faster than anything else I had seen including aircraft or satallites.  It then came to a sudden and abrupt stop in the sky and stayed in the same spot.  At that time another very bright light zoomed in even faster and stopped by the other lights top right.  Then another bright light zoomed in just as fast as the second light and stopped at the first lights top left.  This was all in the east sky just to the south side of town.  All three lights stayed in that same position without moving for about 10 or 15 seconds.  Then, the first light bolted to the north and out of sight at an increadible speed...just as fast as you could point your finger and swing your arm...increadible speed!  The other two lights remainined for about a couple more seconds...and then the second light shot off towards the direction of the first light at the same high speed.  The third light quickly followed after the second light in the same direction and speed.  I sat there amazed with what I had just seen.  None of the lights returned that night and I have not seen anything like it since.  The ability for those lights to come in individually at those high speeds, stop instantly, hover and then dart off at even greater high speeds was definately not any aircraft mankind has or that I am aware off.  It was litterally like the speed of light.  The reason I did not report this earlier was because, even though I strongly believe these objects were not from this planet, I didn't have any other evidence except for my observation.  I also did not know were something like this could be reported...knowing my local police station would just smile when I told them what I had seen.  But when I came across your website, I felt I should provide my observation to get it on record. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Its movement was swift and seemingly impossible. The orange object glowed brighter and brighter orange and started flashing on and off.

My husband and I were driving west bound on Alta Vista Rd. in Yorba Linda at about 6:00pm PST. In the sky ahead was a bright, glowing light falling toward earth with a bright tail of light/fire. First we thought that it was a falling star, but both of us realized quickly it was far too large and too close to the earth for that.  We said to each other, ""its going to crash into the earth"". Then it stopped falling and hovered.  The tail of light extinguished and the main ball of light remained very bright. It faded in and out and then traveled horizontally very quickly. It would dissappear and then suddenly reapper a few miles to the side.  And then dissappear and reappear back in the original place.  Another glowing light seemed to be circling around it in a wide pattern.  Both very bright lights, brighter than airplane headlights. Farther away from these two was another light.  It was blue and very small. It seemed to be circling these in a very wide pattern and we thought it to be airplane watching the phenomenon. But, soon afterward thought it too was related to the UFO.  We didn't pull over and kept driving toward them, but, they got lower to the horizon and we lost sight of them behind trees as the road we were on dipped. When we got back to an unobstructed spot, the lights were gone. The event lasted about 5-10 minutes. Despite the highly visible, quite spectacular display in the night sky, not one report of it could be found on news stations or in the OC Register. We ourselves called into FOX and left a voice mail about the sighting.  No one ever called us back.  In discussing it's location, we estimate that it was approximately 50 miles away whichi would make it over LA County even though we were seeing it from Orange County. There was! a storm coming in that night and the glowing orbs seemed to be near the edge of the cloud bank that could be seen far off toward western horizon toward downtown L.A.

We watched it hoover for a couple minutes as if it was watching us watching it then it startied decending at a slow rate of speed slow enough for us to follow. So we got back in the car and followed an it stopped a quarter mile up the road at a hill which was the highest point in the area which we then stopped and began viewing again while I! took pictures on my old phone which I still have.

It was starting to turn dark right after it left so I went into my house.  Well, after making a few phone calls to tell people what I had seen, I went back outside (about 20 min after the object left) to see if there was a light or anything else. The Unidentified object was definitely gone. However, I did notice planes coming at a high speed from the south, which is the same direction that Buckley Air Force Base is located. There were about 10 of them and they flew directly to the location where the unidentified object was. After the planes flew over I noticed that about 5 of them were circling the exact area that the unidentified object was. They soon left the area, and there was no more action that night. I did try to take everything into consideration, especially the fact that it was the anniversary of the balloon UFO. But I could have seen a balloon moving across the sky. It could have been moving away from me but I would have still been able to see it after moving to another position. Also, in the year that I have lived in Greeley there has never been an airplane fly directly over our apartments and definitely not 10 planes at high speed.

It is our belief that the object is not an airplane, helicopter or any type of aviation device known to humans.  There are no wings, tail, nose or rotary blades.  There is a black haze/mist around the object.  We also noticed that the object had an indention close to the top of the object that might appear to be windows or some type of design that's indented on the object.

I am 15, living in california (14, yesterday.) I had gone to see my grandparents in San Diego.  I am unsure of the date, but it was either the day or the day after my birthday. (August 9th, possibly 10th) I was looking outside the window as we were driving down the highway.  In the car was my mother, I and 3 girls that were friends and worked for my mother since we own a farm.  The time was anywhere between 9PM and 12AM.  I noticed a few white dots moving in the sky, but my eyes quickly adjusted. It was fairly large, possibly 120 yards in diameter and black, triangle shaped.  It had three lights on the bottom. I forget if there was one in the middle.  I assume it was a variation of the TR-B3 after researching it. It spun horizontally while gliding in all directions.  I believe it spun from right to left.  It would glide low along the fields about 200 yards to our right and than rise and fly over the highway.  It was a busy night and there was traffic on this highway out in the middle of nowhere.  As it flew overhead I could make out the shadow of it blocking out the stars as it was a clear night.  It repeated the same manuevers and the traffic began to clear up after about 20 minutes.  At that time it sped off in the direction we were going, west along the highway.  We were pointing towards beale airforce base.   We were on the way home from Six Flags Magic Mountain, so I estimate the sighting between there and Sacramento.   I have been fascinated with UFOs since I was 8, the fleeting wish when I blew out my candles was always to spot a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Two other vehicles pulled over behind me and appeared to be watching this, also. The light balls were not moving much at this point.  I was so excited, I forgot to put my camera on movie mode so all I have are the still photos. Two light beams came down from the sky at an angle from the two light balls to my left. The light beams changed their angle a few times as the light balls moved a little.  Then, suddenly the two light balls formed into one larger light ball.  The two light beams coming to earth formed into three beams, then instantly, there was only one light beam. The light ball came to Earth VERY FAST at an angle following the one remaining light beam.  Then the light ball got much brighter, like it was on fire and it was leaving a ""fire trail"" behind it, not a long one. As it got closer to Earth, it looked like an explosion took place.

My husband got bored and went inside. I continued to watch the light for about 30 minutes.  Then I saw another one rise in the Eastern sky to the left of the first one. It rose just above the tree lines. It moved to the left, then it moved right. The UFO stayed put after that. They both seemed to keep the path of the night sky and stayed all night. They were too close to be stars though. The light twinkling was profoundly artificial in nature.  Keep in mind that I am also seeing airplanes ever few minutes.  Some time later, I saw two craft with bright red flashing lights North and South bound on the horizon. The lights from these crafts were larger than airplane lights, but not as bright as the ""star-like"" lights. They headed straight for one another and leveled off one above the other. The two craft then turned East and flew until disappearing in the distance.  Within about 15 minutes of the two aircraft meeting up, I see a big bright red light not flashing. It had a hot white center. This UFO was descending rapidly from the atmosphere. At exactly the same time an airplane was bound North East. I gasped as their points intersected. I thought there was going to be a crash. There wasn't though. The red UFO leveled off at the horizon and headed East until disappearing from distance.  I had called my mother at the beginning of the sightings. She stayed on the phone with me through out the near crash. During all of this activity, my phone started getting static.

The light was nearing daytime brightness as one of my friends spotted a bright light in the northeast sky falling downward towards the earth at what seemed like tremendous velocity. My first thought was that a massive commit was about to impact the earth, mostly because of the massive wispy trail it left in it’s wake. Then as it neared the earth’s surface it turned upward, this is when we noticed that there were multiple trails that that flowed from the rear of the craft. I no longer believe it was a commit we saw. Another peculiar feature of the trails were that, they did not seem to linger in the sky like any conventional aircraft, but seemed like semi-transparent kite tr! ails swaying non-uniformly  behind whatever we were seeing.

He pointed to something that was very distant like a star, quickly flashing red/blue/green/white or yellow. The object was extremely bright, and we could tell it was emitting a great amount of light because it had a sort of glow. It was so far up that I thought it was a star “twinkling” from disturbances in our atmosphere until I noticed the red light was at the very top blinking slightly slower than the other colors which were quickly flashing. I thought it was almost pyramid or disk shaped, but it was so far that the lights almost appeared as one.  He then proceeded to tell us it could not be a plane because it had been in the same position for 35 minutes.  My friend also asked us if it could be a satellite, but it had no constant or regular movement pattern thus we concluded it wa! s not. We continued to stare at it and, using a street lamp as reference, I noticed it move slightly left. This movement was very minute. If there were another star directly to the left of it with almost no space between, that would be where the craft had moved. My boyfriend and friend were not paying attention when this happened and they did not believe me.  We then noticed that it became very dim, and began thinking it was an airplane all along, but soon enough, the lights grew bright extremely bright then went to the same brightness it was from the beginning.  A few minutes later, using the street lamp to see if any movement had occurred while we were talking, my boyfriend showed us the object was now directly above the lamp and moving to the right of it.  Another friend who lived in the house came out and we showed him.  He said he thought it was a helicopter.  We argued it wasn’t because it was so high in the sky and had barely moved.

When I managed to fully stop to view what this stream was, it did not originate from the earth.  It was dangling from the clouds in the western skies from over the Pacific Ocean.

Pull it open, attach one end to the clouds and let the other end dangle for 10 miles downward and inland for 10 miles.

It was Sunday evening  October 17, 2010 at approximately 6:40 pm.  The skies were predominantly clear and the sun had set, but the skies were not completely dark.  By the end of the encounter a few short minutes later, the skies were dark. The buses had exited I-78 and just south of Nazareth, PA were turning left from Country Club Road onto Newburg Road, when an adult noticed a vibrant blue light out the left (drivers side) windows of the bus.  This light was far brighter than any of the stars which were visible.  As the bus made the left onto Newburg Road, the blue light was now out the right (passenger side) of the bus.  The light was now just above the tree line and was completely stationary.  We observed it for what seemed like an eternity, but in reality was only a few minutes.  During this time, several noted a “pulsing” twice from this light.  It then disappeared as though someone turned off a light switch.  I personally notice a very faint diagonal white line (vapor trail??) which quickly disappeared, but I am not sure if anyone else noticed this.  A few seconds later, the blue light reappeared in the exact same location, but now was bigger. While I only noticed what I thought to be more “pulsing” some of the students (with better vision than me) said it appeared to briefly divide into 3 lights which rotated and expanded outward slightly and then returned.  Others seemed to notice a reddish hue to the right side of the light, but I personally did not see these features.  Since the windows were closed, no sounds could be reported. Since the buses did not stop, within a few minutes we lost sight of the light out of the back of the bus.  It was clearly in our field of view well after we crossed rt. 191. All of the adults on the bus continued to search for rational explanations.  We decided to not say anything to the second bus to test the consistency of our story.  Immediately upon exiting the second bus, the students from bus 2 eagerly asked us if we saw the blue light.  They proceeded to validate the identical story. Several photos were taken from cell phones, but since the buses continued their journey without slowing, these images are slightly blurry.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,40.753,-75.3062

I had not been drinking on the night of the sighting. I was at my home in Slidell, Louisiana, on the night of December 31, 2009 when the sighting occured.  I went outside on my back deck at approximately 9:00 P.M. to observe the New years Eve fireworks going off in my neighborhood.  I happened to look straight up and saw what I thought at first to be some unusual fireworks.  In a few seconds however, I realized I was looking at two strange aircraft which were way too high up to be fireworks.  I saw two identical, perfectly spherical, internally lighted, translucent globes which were predominantly pink in color with uneven pastel blue and gray bands around the globe.  They were not brightly lit, nor did they have any other visible lights on them such as navigation lights, but they were easily visible in the night sky.  They had no visible windows or openings that I could see. They were each about the size of a small house and were at an altitude of about 1,000 to 1,200 feet, and were moving from the Northeast to the Southwest in the general direction of New Orleans across Lake Pontchartrain.  They were flying on a perfectly parallel course at a distance of about an eigth of a mile from one another at exactly the same speed, which appeared to be about 50 t0 60 miles per hour.  One was slightly ahead of the other.  They eventually disappeared into some low hanging clouds a mile or so from where I was standing.  In all, I viewed them for about three minutes, and never heard a sound from them.  The most unusual and distinctive features of the craft were the flange-like collars they had around the bottoms of the globes. From these collars were coming flames which looked like regular fire, not a rocket flame.  These flames did not appear to be any kind of a propulsion system because the flames were deflected backwards by the wind created by the speed of the objects moving through the air on a perpendicular course to the bottom of the globes.  When they first passed over me, I was able to look straight up into the burning cavity created by the collar on the bottom of the globe and it reminded me of what looking into an upside down burning can of Sterno might look like.  These craft looked like they could have been man-made objects, but no man-made objects with these attributes could possibly fly in the way that these did. I've never seen anything like these craft before or since this sighting so I have to classify them as being unidentified flying objects.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,30.273227450980393,-89.7718225490196

I haven't seen any more triangles but have noticed something that really bothered me several times since then. Huge dark rectangles.. barely distinguishable from the night sky. No noise no lights and travelling east over Concord and Pittsburg late at night. I would never have seen them unless i was already looking up and even then they were almost the same color and shade as the sky. The triangle was lit up like disco, but the rectangles i see now and then and have thought about reporting to the faa or local authorities cuz they could be anything...

My sister went outside for a smoke and immediately shouted for us to come outside to see something. From my balcony over looking the whole of Cape Town city bowl, we saw a light. It started the size of a star and as it came closer it got bigger. At first we thought it was a meteor because of its speed and the size it was becoming. It was soon as big as a full moon, but a burning orange. It seemed to hover for about 30 seconds then hovered to the right and it got smaller. It then did 3 big flashes, as though it was turning it's lights off, then all you could see was a black shadow with tiny orange lights.  It was only my one friend and I who could see this, as the other two wear contacts and their vision isn't very good. It started to descend relatively fast.  Just as it reached the glow from the city lights it went completely black and dropped fast. It appeared to have landed in the ocean.  The whole experience lasted between 5 and 10 minutes, and it was around 21:45.

This is no hoax. I swear to you. For the past year I've seen odd things in a certain area in Louisville. It is craft that are mimicing normal aircraft, kinda.  It sort of looks like an airplane, but it's not.  I have lived near an airport for 16 years so I know aircraft! The lights are weird, and it makes no sound, and hovers, and goes fast real quick. I have saw it 4 times in a year. I'm going to tell you about the most important sighting. In July of 2010 at 11pm a friend and myself was driving on I-64 heading one into Louisville. Up on my left I noticed some bright lights, three or four whites & one larger red at an unusually low altitude. At first, I thought maybe it was from a tower of some kind, but it was too big and was definitely some sort of craft. It looked like plane lights kinda, but it wasn't moving at all.  It hovered at about 700 to 1100 feet. I could not see the shape because of the brightness of the object.  Then it started moving and turning/rotating, and for a moment I saw it outlined against the sky. It was a black triangle probably about 30 to 40 feet long. It hovered/turned to where the wings were facing the ground as if turning a tight turn. Then it moved out of sight VERY quickly. Probably a mile in 15 to 30 seconds!   Then it came back just as fast!  Needless to say, we were shaken as we drove out of ! view. This was right off the freeway. I have seen these lights other times as well. Something is up with this certain location. Want to see what it looks like? Look up Oxicarian Ufo on youtube.com and you will see what I saw. To the Tee!!! I researched what we saw and me & the other witness agree that that was it. And yes, this is 100% the truth!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Out of the trailing tracer behind the fireball a dart shaped craft appeared. It was silver or gray with no tail rudder and appeared to be standing still then suddenly began moving southeast perpendicular to the ground. It suddenly picked up speed and disappeared into the horizon leaving behind a light white beam-like tracer that quickly faded. Everyone on the road and in the vicinity saw the fireball/meteorite because traffic slowed down, several people swerved to avoid hitting each other. The meteorite made the local news but I have not seen any reports of the craft that emerged from it. I'm sure most were focused on the fireball because it was spectacular and the craft could have been mistaken for a low flying airplane.

Let me first just give clarity to the reviewing administrator that myself, along with the other two witnesses have normally shot down the idea of UFO's in the stereotypical sense. That being said, here's our story from my perspective. Last night, October 18th, 2010, around 8:00, my fiance, and our mutual friend made plans to cruise dirt roads and over-all just pass the night away. A little after 8:00 P.M (Perhaps a little before), our friend called to let us know she was on her way, and arrived shortly after. We made our way down the usual stretch of the Old Reidsville Collin's Highway (Anderson Street, now), and passed through Collins, Georgia. I was in the back seat, and my fiance` was sitting in the front alongside our friend. I was taking notice at the vast amount of movement in the sky, and the fact that the clouds were streaked, as if they'd been raked. Around 8:40 or so, we arrived at the entrance to a dirt road outside of Collins, then proceeded to turn down into it. By this time, I'd pointed out the activity in the sky, which we joked around about being UFO's. It wasn't until we noticed that what looked to be a military air-craft was pursuing a very vague object that was seamless against the sky, did we stop to think we might be right. The object looked like a very dull star at first, though it was indeed moving. I told our friend to stop the car, and when she inquired why, I told her we'd be able to make it out in a moment because it was about to pass under the moon's light. Once she stopped the car, our friend, my fiance`, and myself exited the car, and watched this very vague craft become more visible the closer it drew towards the moon. The craft then passed over-head, under the moon's light, and we were all utterly dumbfounded by the very prospect of just having witnessed a UFO. We watched as what appeared to be military aircraft, or aircraft of some sort trailing this object. A description of the UFO is provided below;  The craft I saw was in the shape of a soft featured arrowhead. Being overhead, I assume it was the bottom I saw. There were three obvious lights, one at each point, and a design in the middle of the lights that mimicked the original shape of the object. The design was a lighter color than the rest of the craft. The craft itself was black. Almost seamless against the night sky. We reentered the vehicle, and the time was 9:00. (Not exactly, but I believe it was around 9:05-(9:10). My fiance grabbed our friend's phone, and decided she was going to call her mother in total shock of what she'd just seen. There was no service on the phone. I suddenly felt rather ill. Extremely fatigued, my face felt like it had been doused with boiling water. I mentioned it, and our friend and my fiance` both agreed they felt the same. After contemplating what to do, we decided to follow the UFO. It wasn't soon after that it disappeared from all visibility behind a very thin cloud. The aircraft that were pursuing the UFO looked as if they were circling around the cloud. We were sure it'd disappeared, when they began forming a triangular shaped pattern near this cloud. Seemingly out of no-where, this bright orange tinted light suddenly appeared through the cloud, and the UFO became visible once more as it sped past the aircraft. The UFO once again passed near the moon's light, and then began to turn, which granted me the ability of gauging the craft had multiple dimensions and was indeed soft-featured. Once the craft completed it's turn, it began a slow diagonal ascension. At this point, all disbelief has left the three of us. We're intrigued, but tired. Rather distraught, but morbidly curious. While still following the craft, we turned back onto the main highway outside of Collins. We all watched in disbelief as the UFO disappeared yet again. We watched as aircraft began swarming the area it'd disappeared in. We made it back to my fiance's mother's house around 10:00. The three of us decided to ensure no one was lying, we all decided to draw it and not show anyone until we were all finished with the sketches. Sure enough, the sketches were all identical. This morning, I woke up earlier than usual, feeling extremely tired and beat. I felt as if I'd been beaten with a bat. It took my fiance' a while to finally coerce me out of bed. She wasn't feeling well either. About 1:00 P.M today (October 19th, 2010), our friend called us, saying she'd missed her class because she couldn't really move this morning. We all decided this needed to be reported.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,32.0178,-82.0966

I was marveling at the brightness of the moon and the alignment of Jupiter just below it. A moment later I looked up again and saw two lights (only slightly smaller and less bright than the planet) below Jupiter. My first thought was that they appeared to be ""dripping"" from the planet. They were very slowly falling, approximately equidistant from one another and the planet. Their motion reminded me of the slow drift of a flare in the sky, though this most certainly was not anything like a flare. I stopped my bike to watch and my heart began to race as I realized they were not airplanes. I have lived in this city my whole life and am very keenly aware of the flight paths over the city, as well as the movement of lights emitted from airplanes. These two lights were very far away, extremely bright white and not flashing or irregular in any way. They paused their motion for a moment, then rapidly ""flew"" away into the distance, with a trajectory that made them appear to be moving directly away from me. (No lateral movement.) The whole sighting took approximately 5 seconds. Of course, I don't know what I saw but I can say with great certainty that I have NEVER seen anything move that way in the sky.

I'd prefer to remain anonymous.  I've already reported a few of my sightings to another website/organization & regretted it immediately. Two other witnesses and I were laughed at, mocked, and interrogated into silence when the investigators came out to take a look at what we were seeing. We were pretty much told to 'forget about it' and that they were 'just airplanes'. The three of us were so offended and shocked at the ignorant behavior of these two men that we didn't even say goodbye to them. While we were all out there (the three of us & the two investigators) I stood there and counted a dozen 'airplanes'.  Yes, they looked JUST LIKE AIRPLANES at first. I stood there and tried to explain this to the main investigator, but he literally ignored me and kept jabbering to my friend about things that didn't even pertain to what we were doing.  They weren't moving like planes. They didn't make any sound. And they popped up randomly all over the sky. My friend and I had seen this several nights in a row. That's how it would all begin. First the flashy 'airplanes', and then the weirder stuff would show up. On our way out to the location, I had seen a very large cigar-shaped golden-yellow glowing craft off in the distance, near the horizon, first just hovering and then moving slowly, horizontally.  It literally appeared out of no where. After all the of the flashy guys showed up (the fake airplanes), another one of these very large cigar-shaped crafts popped up again. Right along the horizon. My friend and I pointed it out to the investigator and he acted as if he didn't even see it at first. It wasn't until it started moving (because it was hovering in that spot) that he noticed it, and before anything else could be said... he LOUDLY and very forcibly said, 'girls, it's just an airplane!'  Just an airplane? My friend and I looked at each other (the other witness (my Mom) was in the vehicle, as it was very cold out and she couldn't handle it) and shook are heads. The investigator acted totally oblivious when we started talking about him in front of him, about how he had to be blind and that he must have thought we were stupid to believe his lies. These rude and interrogating tactics may work with other people, but we know what we've been seeing. It's like trying to tell someone that there is no sun, even as it's beating down on their heads. My Mom later told us that when she was looking in the sky with the binoculars that one of the investigators had let her use, she saw something really strange near this odd cluster of stars no one could seem to identify, (despite the fact that they'd brought one of those star-detecting things) and when she went to tell the investigator about it, he ripped the binoculars out of her hands and ignored her. You can't imagine the things I've seen on a nightly basis! Amazing things! I've seen an 'airplane' split in half, like mitosis, forming two flying crafts. I've watched an 'airplane' transform into a triangular-shaped UFO and then watched it descend towards the ground. I've seen the same triangular-shaped UFO pop up, out of no where, under the very cloudy sky, at treetops height, fly OVER my car, and see it land in a cornfield. I've seen what I thought were stars suddenly begin moving and flying all over the sky in strange formations. Strange blue glowing lights that move from left to right, left to right, right to left, right to left,... Weird balls of plasma-like light that have strange flashing red lights going off all around it like a sea of drunken sailors in the night sky. I've seen hundreds upon hundreds of UFOs-- some possibly top secret military & some not of this earth, all different types, doing things that can only be described as 'magic'. Glowing mists in the sky! . Animals acting very strange (especially the dogs in town & the cattle outside of town). Odd sounds in the middle of the night-- sonic booms, electrical pulses, tapping on the walls... Being jolted awake in the middle of the night, terrified. There have been a lot of landings recently, too. I've seen landings in cornfields, strange glowing lights in the middle of the field, and often I see craft that hover over several of my neighbors houses and several nights later I'll see UFOs landing in their backyards. On Thanksgiving, my nephew told about a UFO he had seen in a cornfield. He described it. Saucer-shaped. Dark and metallic. With what appeared to be very strange 'Christmas-like' lights on it. It's funny because both myself & my friend have seen similar lights on other crafts before. My friend also had a triangular-shaped UFO fly over her van after she left my place on the 9th of November. It hovered over her for a bit as she pulled over, rolled down the window, and stuck her head out the window. She said it had super-fast moving Christmas-like lights on the underside and she felt as if she were being hypnotized. It left her feeling dizzy and nauseous. They notice when you notice. On November the 12th I was in my bedroom, about to get ready for bed. I don't really remember exactly what I was doing - if I was reading a book or making my bed or what. But I heard an owl hooting outside of my bedroom window. I don't remember when I first noticed it, but I remember going to the window and opening it up. It kept hooting. It was VERY STRANGE. I'd never heard an owl out here before. My room is in the basement so the window is literally ground level. I could tell the owl was sitting on the ground right beside the window, but when I looked out (stretching the screen as far as I could) I NEVER saw it. But it was RIGHT THERE. And it wouldn't stop hooting. On and on it went. With only a second or two in between. For what I would guess to be 15-20 minutes, but I can't be sure on that because I don't really even remember when it stopped. While it was hooting I looked towards the night sky. There were UFOs all over. Fake airplanes morphing into random things. Flying ! saucers. Shooting stars and fire balls. Plasma balls. The night sky was going crazy. But that's it. That's all I remember. I only guess that the owl hooted for 15-20 minutes, but I don't know. It could have been hooting for all of eternity. I don't remember leaving the window. I don't remember shutting the window. I don't even remember going to bed. The only thing I do remember is a strange dream I had involving my Dad (who died 9 months ago), aliens, a HUGE holographic telescope in my backyard, and Saturn. I remember having seen The Fourth Kind not too long after it came out. And upon remembering hearing the owl, I remembered this movie. So I did a little research online. Most people only report having SEEN the owl. But my case is totally different. I never saw the owl, I only heard it. On the 13th, though, I didn't quite place how weird the entire night before was right away. I didn't even know that I had forgotten. I just remembered the owl and was oblivious to the fact that it was weird that I had forgotten all else. It wasn't until weeks after that night that I realized how bizarre it all really was. And the more I tried to remember, the more I forgot. It's like a twisted mind-game and it leaves me feeling like I'm losing my mind!  My friend and I would discuss things we had seen separately. We both had a lot of the same experiences even when we were apart. Especially concerning our dreams. On nights that one of us would call about having a strange dream about aliens & UFOs, the other would confirm that she, too, had been having vivid dreams of aliens & UFOs. These dreams involve the government and how they're trying to control us & keep us unaware of the alien presence, others about upcoming earth changes that could be devastating on a mass scale, others involving strange experimentation with genetics & reproduction,... I could go on and on. There is so much to say,... but this is getting long. All I want are answers. I want to know what's going on. I want to know about the strange creatures that talk to me in my dreams - some of them that look like Grays, some that look like Dragons... I have a hard time sleeping at night,... If possible, I would like this sighting removed from the site as soon as possible. I just want someone to email me, and discuss it that way. No phone calls. No investigations. Nothing. I just need someone to talk to.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,,

Several bright lights caught my attention to my right out my glass door.  Looking out my sliding glass door directly adjacent to my chair, I observed a series of five (5) light in a “V” formation in the sky moving directly west of my home. My home lies in the Smith River canyon with a ridgeline on the southern, eastern and western sides on my home. This series of lights were moving slowly from east to west.  They were extremely bright and white in color.  The lights disappeared in sequence as they traveled in the sky over the western ridgeline out of sight. I had several impressions.  Firstly fireworks, however there was no smoke trail,  independent movement of the light nor vertical movement.  Secondly, a major aircraft (possible airliner) was in the process of crashing or forced landing.  I ran out to my deck overlooking that portion of the sky horizon and heard nothing.  No jet aircraft noise at all.  The lights I had observed were as bright and illuminating traveling away from my position as they would have been had they been landing lights traveling towards my position only brighter. I ran upstairs to my bedroom and asked my wife if she had seen these exceptionally bright lights.  She said no, but she had heard a rumble and the second floor of the home had been shaking.  I considered calling the sheriff’s department (where I work), but reconsidered, as I did not want to be made fun of for crackpot questions.  I did not call. On 102010, at 0600 hrs I went to work and relieved the night shift patrol sergeant, exchanging highlights from the previous evening.  I casually asked if there had been any report of lights.  I was briefed on the following events. At 1953 hrs (101910), the Del Norte Sheriff’s Office received a call from Russ Burks of the FAA in Seattle, WA.  Burks stated that a U.S. Air Force refueling aircraft had been “completely” illuminated by a green laser.  This occurred somewhere between Crescent City, CA and Happy Camp, CA.  The aircraft was at 22,000 feet when this illumination occurred.  Burks requested DNSO to respond to the Gasquet, CA area to investigate any unusual activity and possible source of the laser. The nightshift sergeant and a trainee were already in this area for 35 to 40 minutes without seeing anything suspicious. In the Ft. Dick area just north of Crescent City a deputy sheriff observed a series of lights that were very bright, large and believed to be some type of aircraft.  This deputy is a former US Marine and insisted the lights were not flares or any type of military aircraft he had seen prior. From 2018 hrs (101910) to 2037 hrs, multiple calls were received by DNSO dispatch through “911” regarding white/orange lights, possible flares and military jets in the area.  The sergeant had dispatch re-contact FAA Seattle Center to inquire about possible military jets being in Del Norte County.  The response from the FAA was that F-15s were in our County “doing their thing”.  This is all they would say. Later this same day (102010), I spoke to many of our staff about the previous evening. One staff member had seen these lights (orange to white) while leaving an event in Smith River, CA (just south of the Oregon border).  The lights were exceptionally bright.  They seemed to blink off two at a time until gone from sight. Another staff member reported seeing the refueling aircraft at a high altitude and that this aircraft was completely visible from underneath by a bright green light. Another staff member had spoken to a local business owner (Owner operator of an air ambulance fight company).  This owner stated that he and his wife had been exiting a store in Brookings, Oregon (20 miles north of Crescent City) and had seen these bright lights.  He had told our staff member that he believed there was some large aircraft “on approach” to the Brookings small aircraft field.  Then the lights seemed to blink out two or three at a time. His secretary later told this owner that she had been leaving a gym in Harbor, Oregon (adjacent to Brookings) when her car had been completely illuminated from overhead by a bright white light.  She had thought at the time that a streetlight may have blown up, but now suspects that it was something else. In summary, this event was highly unusual for this area.  The report of a military aircraft being illuminated at 22,000 feet by a green laser, the later appearance of tactical aircraft flying at low altitude pursuing or training pursuit, the large set of lights slowly moving east to west at low altitude. The weather conditions this evening were clear skies, 50’s in temp and a nearly full moon in the southeastern sky. What I observed was massive and brighter than any light I have seen on an aircraft.  I did not hear any noise when I went outside seconds after it went over the ridgeline. The military regularly uses an air corridor that is south to north directly over my home.  Their altitude is always 20,000 or above. I am very familiar with that activity. What I saw that night was nothing like I have seen before. NOTE:  I am willing to speak to an investigator, but DO NOT release my name or information to ANY outside source. There are official two official entries into the DNSO CAD (computer assisted dispatch) system.  CAD #201010190057 relates the call from FAA Seattle Center.  CAD #201010190060 relates to the “911” calls about lights seen and jets in the area.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,41.6731,-123.9455

The moon was bright and there was some high altitude haze in the atmosphere, so most stars were barely visible at the time.  At first glance this looked like 2 stars, but then I noticed they were moving slowly.  They appeared to be at very high altitude, maybe 40K feet.  The moved due East in parallel to each other for about 10 seconds.  Then they faded away gradually over a ~5 second period.   I estimate the lights were about 45 degrees above the horizon. There are no major airports due East of Raleigh, but there are military bases East of here.  These lights did not have the typical strobes flashing that is common on commercial aircraft.   Most high altitude air traffic over Raleigh is running North-South up the East coast of the country.  Given the lack of strobes on what I observed, I'm confident these were not commercial aircraft. The only plausible explanation would be military aircraft.  Military aircraft can run without lights.  But do they have bright lights to illuminate them like a star?  These objects were bright and no strobes were present.  The looked like bright stars or a planet would look, such as Venus.  Given that they appeared to be at high altitude, they would not have been flying in close military formation.  I would estimate the distance between these 2 objects would have been over a mile if they were at 40K feet.  Given that they were well above the horizon and the lights faded relatively quickly (~5 seconds), it's not consistent with an aircraft slowing flying out of sight over the horizon.  I have no explanation. Also, high altitude commercial air traffic was leaving vapor trails in the atmosphere on this night, visible by the moonlight.  These objects left no vapor trail.

My wife and I were driving from Savannah to Statesboro on I-16W.  Just as we were passing I-95 we saw, way out ahead of us, three lights a red light with a white light to the right and left of it just above the tree line.  Initially we thought that it was an airplane, but then we noticed that it was not moving.  Then we figured that it was a tower of some sort, but there were no lights above it or below it like on the legs of a microwave or water tower. We kept watching the object for about 12-15 minutes until we finally got right up to it, at Exit 143.  The object was almost directly above the interstate, just to the south side and maybe 300-500 feet up.  I slowed the car down to a crawl and rolled the window down and miraculously we weren’t rear-ended by the cars behind us.  I could hear no engine sounds and felt/heard no propeller wash, as from a helicopter.  From underneath the object we saw three large circular red lights in a line and perpendicular to that line was a curved line of red lights.  In between the red lights there were smaller circular lights which I believe were white in color.  At the eastern end of the object (the side we approached from, which I believe to be the front of the object) we saw what appeared to be to spot lights pointed east and angled slightly toward the ground. After we passed by the object I immediately called my father (an Air Force vet who grew up on US Marine bases) and asked him if he knew of anything that could fit the description.  Dad could not tell me about anything that fit that description.  My wife and I quickly sped up and turned around at the first opportunity (Exit 137) to try to get a picture of it.  The object was out of our sight for two to three minutes while we turned around.  When we got back to the place where we passed beneath the object, it was gone without a trace. I am pretty familiar with military and civilian aircraft, fixed and rotary wing alike, having grown up in a military family and around air bases/air ports.  I haven’t the faintest clue what this object was, where it came from, or where it went.  Any suggestions?",2010-08-24T00:00:00,,

Later I told freand, and showed her the photos.

In the wee hours of the morning of June, 19th, 2010, my youngest son and I were sitting outside on the back porch at my Mothers house, in the small community of Bluff City, AR., about 20 miles NW of Camden, AR.  It was around 3:30 am and my son and I were sitting outside visiting and talking.  I happened to look up at the sky in front of us and I noticed a very bright yellowish orange light shining in the southern sky.  My first thought was “satellite”, and to dismiss it, without calling attention to it. I glanced back at the sky and this light had grown a lot brighter and was also getting larger.  This confused me and I turned to mention it to my son when he said “hey Mom!  Look at that light!”.  I was about to tell him it was most likely a satellite when I saw that it had grown much larger (closer?), and brighter and was now not very far above the treetops.  We both sat there with our breath held and our mouths wide open watching this strange spectacle.  Suddenly, the light no longer seemed to be moving, but hovered for a second above the treetops, and then it suddenly veered up and off towards the east and before either of us could say “did you see that?!?!?” it had totally disappeared!  We just stared at each other and I asked him…”uhm, did you see that?” Hmmm…that star moved up and away…fast!”. He asked me if I thought that was the definition of a “UFO”… We decided that it was most definitely unidentified, was an object, and  flew away very fast!   Had my son not witnessed it as well, I would never have said anything about it.  Ever! I would love to explain it away by calling it a shooting star, but in my experience, shooting stars streak across and d o w n  the night sky, not  u p  the night sky. I am now attempting to convince myself that perhaps it was a new aircraft being tested at the AFB in Shreveport, LA., although it made n o  sound at all!  Today, just for fun, I thought I would do a “Google search” to see if maybe there were comets or meteors or something reported around the same time that my son and I saw this interesting, for lack of a better word, Object!

So I got up and went on the front verandah where I saw three lights up in the sky.  I was puzzled because we were live we are the last occupants and the road does not go that far back into the jungle. For a fact, everyone here knows there is nothing but raw jungle back there that local villagers sometimes go to hunt.  At first I was thinking it might be flares, but then I said to myself flares shoot up from the ground into the sky, exploded and light up the sky while coming down.  But these lights didn’t come from the ground and they weren’t falling.  One just appeared and moved down slowly, then stopped and hovered there for a while.  Then two more lights appeared and the left and right of It and did the same thing.  The three lights just hovered there for about 10 minutes and then one by one followed each other behind the jungle.  We could see the top of the trees when it was landing. After that I was just amazed and puzzled at what I just saw trying to figure out what it could be.  My dad told me that they often comes every now and then around the same time and then leave about 20 minutes after.  So I stayed on kept watching and sure indeed in 15 minutes, one by one they came back up.  It flew up for about 200 feet in the sky and then just disappeared. There was no noise of any kind. The next night, October 30, 2010 they came back.  However, this time there were about 20 lights up in the sky at the same time hovering over the same place.  I started to get scared a little because they just kept coming in and landing one after the next.   My entire family came out to watch as one by one they appeared up in the sky.  I was really scared because I taught it was like an invasion or something like war of the worlds going to happen and my family was going to be the first.  My sister didn’t want to scare her kids so she took them down and sent them to bed. To make sure we were not the only ones seeing these lights, I took my cell phone and texts all my friends in the village about the lights so they too can see them.  And I also took some photos on my cell phone that you can have to analyze. I never believed until I saw it for myself.  I have never believed that humans are alone in this universe but I didn’t expect to see something like that.  My dad who I have had this discussion with several times arguing that there is nothing out there realized that he may well be wrong. Now I don’t know what to think and this is making all of us re assess our beliefs into what man has made us to believe.  I’m not going to just drop my faith but I know what I saw and that was not human.  When watching the television serious “Ancient Aliens” I connected right away with it.  And maybe what they say is true.  That is the human race realize we are not alone we will react in chaos.

Light spotted cavorting in the sky near Revere.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by experienced amateur astronomer.

From the back deck, I have a view of a set of low hills to the north of the town where I live. I saw a bluish-white light travelling westward along the line of the hills.  Initially, I thought that there must be a road along the ridge and I was seeing a car travelling along it.  After several seconds, however, the light moved downward from my vantage point on another hill (meaning that the object appeared superimposed on the ridge line but was in fact between my location and the hills behind it) and moved back toward the east. After moving about 5 degrees eastward, the light moved upward, passing above the top of the hills from my vantage point, and then moved back westward.  The object did not rise to a high altitude because there are two radio towers visible to the north of my position, and the object did not appear to move higher than the top of either tower. I watched the object make numerous loops over a period of about ten minutes.  I estimate that the angular distance covered by the object from one side of the loop to the other was about five degrees.  The time required to cross this distance was five seconds-I timed it.  I later did a ""back of the envelope"" calculation to determine the object’s speed.  Assuming that the hills are three miles from my position, and that the end points of the object’s loop were equidistant from me (not true, but close enough to get an estimate), then we solve the triangle that results given that we know two sides and the included angle.  The distance from one side of the loop to the other is roughly one-quarter of a mile, and the object crossed this distance in five seconds.  The necessary speed works out to roughly 180 miles per hour. This speed is consistent with a small aircraft, but I could see no indication of lights other than the object itself, which appeared as a bluish-white light.  I’ve seen small biplane aircraft do aerobatic maneuvers at low altitude before, but only out in the country, and never over an area as densely settled as eastern Massachusetts.  And again, if it was an aircraft, where were the other lights?  The object appeared to me to be a light.  I did not see any suggestion of size or shape: what I saw was visible only as a point of light. There were low-lying clouds that morning. There was sufficient light to see by, but the sun had not yet come up; frankly, the ambient light is not really relevant here anyway, because there is so much light pollution in eastern Massachusetts that I can see the outline of the hills even in the middle of the night because there are towns on the other side of them. I finally left off watching the object because I had to finish getting ready for work, but it was still making its loops. I am a college instructor of history, with more than 20 years worth of experience in amateur astronomy. In addition, I’ve spent 15 years working in planetariums.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,42.4163,-70.9969

Monday evening at around 11:15 pm on November 8th, 2010, I was leaving my in-laws house when I looked to the south-west tree line and noticed some strange lights emanating from the woods. At first glace, I assumed a police officer had pulled someone over because the light that I was seeing was hazy, almost like police lights shinning through fog. As I began to drive home I was beginning to notice that the lights were too bright to be police lights. I decided that I wanted to investigate further, so I began driving as close to the source as I could. When I reached the source of the light, I was astonished to find that it definitely was not coming from a police car, but rather in the woods, off the road about 300 yards was a bright white light sitting on the ground. As I sat in my car on the road looking through the woods, the light appeared to be about the size of a SUV or large van, but it was a solid oval looking bright white light. The mysterious thing was that the lights coming off from the object was a light blueish color, but the object itself was bright white. The woods that it was sitting in was not very thick, and during the day time you can vaguely see through to the other side, so I was thinking that the object was close to the center of the woods. I sat in my vehicle in shock for about fifteen minutes, staring at the object trying to decipher what it could possibly be. Finally, around 11:45 pm the object completely blinked off. At this point, I began watching the tops of the treeline because it was a very clear night, so if something was to rise up out of the woods, it would have blocked the stars behind it. However, after about five minutes I did not see the object light up again, or leave the woods, and I was too afraid to stay any longer, and I drove home. That night, I couldn't stop thinking about what I saw. I've always been interested in paranormal phenomenon and UFO sightings, but I've always tried to debunk any evidence before considering it to be unexplainable. With this object, I could not think of any explanation. I knew I had to investigate this sighting further, or else the unknown aspect of it would plague me for the rest of my life. Luckily, I had the following day off of work. Right after I woke up on Tuesday morning, I immediately began figuring out how I would investigate what I saw further. I called my Dad who lived in California at the time, and told him my story. I asked what he would do if he were in my position, and he said you have to go back to the woods and try to find anything earthly to explain what you saw. I completely agreed, and immediately returned to the location of my sighting. When I parked my car in the exact same spot that I had been the night before, I stared at the woods remembering what had transpired about twelve hours ago. I began going to the houses close to the woods to try and find who owned them. When i spoke to one of the neighbors, he informed me of where I could find the owners, but after hearing my story he said, ""Wow that is strange! Well I can tell you this much, there isn't normally, and shouldn't be anything like that going on in the woods at that time."" With my new information, I headed to the owner of the woods house. Unfortunately, no one was home, so I left a note I had written on the door with my contact information. It has been almost two months since the night of my sighting, and I have yet to receive any calls from the owner of the woods. I can't pass by those woods at night and think of the sighting I had on the night of November the 8th, 2010. I still do not know what it could have been in the woods that night, and apparently, I never will.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,42.9965,-84.1874

When the clouds rolled across the highline electrical grid it caused some disturbance and made an object temporary visible though the breaking clouds.  The object that was hiding above (or inside) the clouds was temporary visible until it passed the electrical power lines.    This object was black but it appeared like it was shorting out because there where green flairs sparking around it. The size and shape was not visible on account that it was partially cloned and hidden by the cloud.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,36.8985,-89.5669

We then both ran to the back bedroom window, and noticed that it had already passed the building, zipping through the sky at speed, leaving no trails behind whatsoever. We also noticed that it was unusually low, standing out from what was a clear blue sky. We observed the object darting speedily through the sky, stop dead in its tracks, hover, and then seem to fall straight down a few feet, stop suddenly once more, then shoot away, fading to a small pin-prick size, eventually disappearing altogether from sight.

I looked up at it and it was unusual in both color and shape. The ambient noise made it impossible to determine if there was any associated engine noise, but the object was indeed unusual. For the time that we observed it, it moved several times. The impression was that it was demonstrating an interest in the fire works, and we discussed the possibility of it being a helicopter or balloon/dirigible observing the firework display.  My son pointed out that the lighting was not correct for either.  Upon conclusion of the firework display, the object traveled quite fast to the east where we lost sight of it.  We then walked over to a local dinner approximately a 15-minute walk.  Before entering the dinner, I looked back in the direction of where the object had been and it had returned.  This coincided with the start of another towns’ commencing of! a fireworks display.

I was driving to the store yesterday, it was starting to get dark. The horizon was just getting orange/pink, but the majority of the sky was still blue. So I'm driving and I happen to look up and see a large white/gray object in the sky. It looked like a blimp at first, but those are almost never around here and this was also an area close to an airport. What stood out was it looked like it was tilted on an angle, which didn't seem right. So I tried to keep watching as I was driving, passing by trees and buildings that would temporally block it from view, but it would always come back into view. When I looked away for a few seconds and looked back it was gone. This was a straight street too, driving right beside it. How could it fly/move away that fast when I was just looking there a few seconds ago? So I shrug it off and keep driving. Then about 10-15 seconds later I look back at the same spot in the sky and see this small, but very bright white light with this weird, very short smoke/cloud stream behind it. It was just a light too, not a plane or anything and the sky was still very bright at this time. It looked like an extremely bright little star, but in a blue sky. So I'm still driving trying to watch it and come to a stop light and sit there. I look back at it and now the stream is completely gone, but it seems to be moving very slow in the sky, same with the blimp-like thing. It didn't fade away, it was like it was never there and now the light has gotten very dim, almost blinking out, then it does, but comes back a little brighter, then brighter then it blinks out and is gone all together and not a thing is in the sky there. Now I'm getting weirded out. Now that it's gone I keep looking in the same direction trying to find something, but what I see now is the weirdest of the three. I see this large, flat, saucer/disk like shape in the sky. It was colored like a cloud, a very faint white, almost transparent color like it was trying to blend into the sky. This thing is very low in the sky, right above the treetops. I come to another stop light and watch it. It slowly moves from the right to the left behind some trees in the distance, then comes back to the right. Then I notice a second, then a third.

As I drove closer to it it disappeared behind the tree line. I was alone in the car but on the phone with my Husband who I reported it to. It really spooked me. I knew it wasn't an airplane or helicopter, no sound, I turned off the radio and rolled the window down, no sound. I continued along RT 35 and could not see anything else? Definitely some kind of UFO.I just can't stop thinking about it.

I own a boat dock on Smith Mountain Lake that looks west and gives me a great view of sunsets. When the weather is nice, I might visit it several times a week at the end of the day. The view from the dock over the water looks west, and to  the west about 25 miles away is Roanoke Virginia, which has a regional airport, and sometimes I watch the planes land, circle or take off. Tonight was very calm, no clouds, clear blue skies and unlimited visibility. Well the sun set, and as usual, the glow from the city took its place in the west, as the stars began to come out. The brightest ones first of course. Now this must have been around or a little after 8 o'clock pm and I noticed two bright stars in the western horizon towards Roanoke. I figured they were both planets, thinking Venus on the left which was the dimmer of the two, and the brighter one on the right, well....had to be Jupiter I guessed, but pretty bright for Jupiter. Both were low in the horizon and nearly horizontally aligned. Behind me (towards the east) was a full moon rising and that gave off quite a bit  of light as well.  It was a very nice and rather bright evening to sit outside and enjoy the end of the day which I continued to do for the next 25 minutes or so. After about 20 minutes I looked above me thinking that the other stars would be coming out now as well, and a few were out, but much more dimmer in relationship to the two I had been watching. Well let me rephrase that, the one on the left could still have been Venus, but the Jupiter light on the right was still too bright. Even for Jupiter.  Now I will admit, I am not even sure what planets are suppose to be out there at this time. But I supposed it was possible I was seeing two planets and Jupiter was really bright tonight. Then it happened. The ""Jupiter"" light on the right, after being absolutely motionless and hanging there with the ""Venus” light for 25 minutes, began to move slowly in a northerly direction. I need to say that I wouldn’t be writing this if I thought there was any way this could have been a plane, I have lived here all my life, I am very familiar with seeing planes in the distance landing at the Roanoke Airport. I have seen them when I was positioned ""dead on"" to their approach or take off and it can look like they are just vertically rising or vertically coming down. I have seen them land or take off at angles to me, and seen that gradual rise in take-off or gradual drop in landing. But this one was brighter, sat absolutely motionless for about 25 minutes, and then moved to the north. It eventually was obscured by the hills and I lost sight of it, but it was a lot closer than I thought. It really was astounding to see it move after all that time. It wasn’t a plane, and it wasn’t Jupiter. I am now wondering, if, because the moon was so bright behind me, that the moon was reflecting upon this ""object"" and making it seem brighter. It’s possible, but I know it wasn’t a plane; it hung in the sky for too long. That’s my story.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,37.1759,-79.8013

We were watching fireworks that the neighbors were shooting off for the Fourth of July, so our eyes were on the sky. I noticed a very unusual ""firework"" that was higher than the low-flying clouds.  I pointed and asked my boyfriend (we are both over 50 and were not drinking)""What the heck is THAT?!!""  The object we both saw was coming from the east and headed in a straight line toward the west. It definitely looked man-made because it appeared to have flames on the bottom, but it was so high up that it could not have been a normal kind of fireworks.  The fact that we could detect flames even though it was so high up made us think the actual ""object"" had to be fairly large.  It traveled at a speed that was like if you watch the ISS go over or something like that except that it was much closer to earth than that (the ISS) or even satellites.  We have no idea what it was we saw, but neither of us had ever before seen anything like it.  My boyfriend has! been a novice astronomer for many years, fyi.  We weren't timing it but I am guessing it took a little over a minute before it faded out of view still flying on course.  There was a top on it above the flames, but it's been almost a month now and I honestly cannot remember well enough to describe the part above the flames. I was listening to George Noory last night and heard mention of the Fourth of July sightings.  I had no idea where to report this phenomena at the time, but hope this report will be of help even though it's approximately a month old.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,36.4405,-82.3495

At the time it looked like those lights that shimmer through the sky when there is an important event.  I thought maybe they were on the mountain. But these lights weren’t moving.  They were stationary. The closer I drove I realized these lights were coming out of a massive cloud and and the V shape of lights looked like clouds themselves and with the moon in the middle of the V it seemed to make them glow. (It didn’t always appear to be a V with different turns in the road it was hard to tell when I drove closer.) It wasn’t long when I realized I was driving under the strobes of lights. Only maybe 15 minutes had lapsed since I first spotted it to the point they were in the air on each side of me. (If I was going 60 miles an hour they had to be at least 45 miles long.)  When I turned onto Hwy 277 the enormous cloud was up close and just to the left of the road. In the center of this cloud was a dark black hole where the lights of the perfectly shaped V came out. In the dark hole I could see at least 3 red stationary blinking lights. I also saw an additional red light, briefly, that moved around one of the light beams coming from the hole. I was completely under the outer edge of the massive cloud (7:45 p.m.) just before turning on to 77 and losing eyesight of it. Ironically, when I looked at a road map I realized the mysterious cloud was sitting in the middle of a triangular form where 3 roads intercepted. Between 3 cities: Heber, Snowflake and Holbrook. It was in the middle of this triangular form of roads. ( Hwys 277, 77, 377)  I never saw another soul driving on 277 but there were others on 260. Did anyone else report it?",2011-01-05T00:00:00,,

First Sighting  I was driving my 18 wheeler through Mississippi today, I was about 25 miles west of Meridian heading West on interstate 20, the sun was going down and had just dipped below the horizon, so it was still pretty much daylight. The sky was clear with just a few small wispy clouds. Looking through my windshield I noticed a bright light in the sky in front but slightly to the left, I pointed it out to my 12 year old son who was sitting in the passenger seat, saying to him “look at that star” and that it seemed unusual to see a star in daylight, not knowing too much about astronomy , I added that it was perhaps Venus which is why we can see it because I couldn’t see any other stars as I looked around the rest of the sky. As we looked at what by now I was convinced was Venus, a small wispy cloud moved across but the light was not obscured by the cloud, the cloud passed and the bright light was again in a cloudless part of the sky, a few seconds later I remarked to my son that the br! ight light appeared to be moving a little more to the left and also appeared to growing slightly dimmer, then it became quite obvious it was moving as it picked up speed very quickly moving upwards at a roughly 45 degree angle, it completely disappeared within a few seconds over the south western sky. All in all we had watched this thing for about 5-6 minutes, I noted the time that it disappeared, it was 4.55 pm central time.  Second Sighting  My wife was also traveling in the truck but was in the sleeper listening to an audio book, I had considered disturbing her to look at the bright light when I first noticed it, but thinking I would be disturbing her for something as unremarkable as an ‘ early’ star or Venus I didn’t bother, it was only when my son and I realized that this thing was moving off at a high rate of speed that I finally called  her, just too late for her see anything, in fact when I told her what we had just seen, I thought  she might think we were imagining or exaggerating it.  For approximately the next 10 minutes my Son and I discussed what we had seen with my wife, telling her several times that I had wished I had disturbed her so she could have seen it too.  Then to my astonishment the light suddenly appeared again, this time all three of us watched it, but it only stayed stationary for about a minute, then started moving again, except this time it moved in the opposite direction ( south west to! south east) and in less than 10 seconds faded out of sight completely, it was almost as if someone turned out the light with a ‘dimmer’ switch! The only difference this time was that it didn’t look exactly the same kind of light a star at night has, this time it had a reddish hue to it, we think that this time because of the change in direction it may have been reflecting the sun, despite the sun being quite a way below the horizon by now.  I ought to add that I’m sure the object was very high in the sky, I don’t believe it was a plane because all the planes were leaving long contrails. Also, planes don’t really move that way. No flashing airplane lights either.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,32.36501233766234,-88.64420324675325

To the west of I-75 I would say a couple of miles or so away – difficult to judge distance when the object is in the air – I saw a large illuminated craft hovering in the sky.  At first I thought I was seeing an airplane coming in for a landing; I was driving and trying to look at the same time.  It was evident that the object was NOT an airplane although it could have been the size of a small plane.  The object was disk shaped and looked to have a bubble top.  There was an orange colored light on the underneath side that pulsed maybe every 10-15 seconds.  I was intent on getting to my destination in Atlanta so I did not pull over or exit the Interstate to investigate – wish I had.  I look for a logical explanation – have never seen an object in the air that I could not identify and thought that this object should be a! blimp or an advertising attention getter.  I was told that there has been a blimp in that area for around a week, but I saw that blimp and it is the wrong shape, not illuminated from within, and the light it has is on top of the craft and pulsates more frequently – and the blimp is on the move, not hovering.

Then it turned, sharply, to the North and continued at a slower pace, with short bursts of speed.  Then it got smaller and began to ""burn out"".  It just looked like something that is running out of fuel, where it would glow brightly, then suddenly dim, then burn bright for a few more seconds until it finally went out.

I have pictures of a few of these crafts but not the one that I'm reporting.  I was standing out in my driveway looking up at the night sky. Looking, constantly looking for something unusual.  After about 2 hours of staring at the stars, I finally decided to go back inside my home.  After I walked up to my front door, I opened the storm door and then turned around once more to look into the sky. When I fist noticed it, I wanted to freak out.  There it was an object floating in on a direct path, It didn't move side to side or volley up and down. It moved as if though it had a mission or purpose. I was nervous, and scared,  So afraid in fact that I could feel my knees buckling. I guess because I didn't know what to expect and I wanted to act non aggressive. I though that I was either going to be taken, blasted into nothing, or become part of this things menu. So I! wanted whatever or whoever was propelling this thing to know that I am not a threat. As It approached from the North sky,  It floated down into my yard just above the tree in the center of my yard. Then it lowered itself approximately 7 to 10 feet above my head and stopped for approximately 5 to 7 seconds then proceeded forward ascending above my rooftop. As it was leaving I yelled out ""What are You."" it never made a sound, not one sound. It was an unusual color.  A low intensity pinkist to violet light, that was almost hypnotic to look at. When I first noticed it all that could be seen was the front. As it came closer I noticed that it's body was approximately 20 to 30 feet in length. The body looked as if though it was filled with fluid color. It had no wings. the body also had no real width (I mean that it appeared that nothing living could occupy that space). approximately 1 foot in width, but the front was enormous compared to the body 4 to 5 feet in width. There were! windows or slits in the front that were slanted in opposite d! irection s and were also illuminated. As it elevated higher to clear my house and the trees in the back yard its speed never accelerated. I would guess that it's speed was approximately 10 to 15 miles per hour until it was out of sight. It should also be mentioned that I attempted to get video of all of this, but upon uploading my camera videos to my computer I noticed that I had nothing. I pushed record my battery was charged and had worked with all other encounters, but not this one. After I went inside I told everyone about this encounter.

It was about the size of a soccer ball, as far I could tell.  I immediately called out to the others behind me. The object seemed to just float and was moving south east, but as it did so, it slowly zigzagged and even paused a couple times.  I observed this object for no more than 5 minutes, when suddenly it stopped moved moving.  It rotated and as it did so the light was turned off. It almost seemed like it had a shudder that rotated over the light. But just as the light went out, the object vanished right before our very eyes. The four of us just stood there staring up at the sky in awe of what we had just witnessed.  The others tried to come up with some logical explanation as to what it was.

I stepped out to the back deck for a smoke. As I sat in my beach chair leaning back I noticed two hawks or buzzards in a thermal at approx. 1500 ft. Looking beyond them I noticed another object farther up and hovering at approx. 5-6000 ft. It looked to the size of a small airplane but with no wings and just sitting there. The birds had moved to the east by now and it was just this thing hanging up there , I looked away and looked back to make sure it was not something on my eyes . (floaters)  I called out to my son to bring a camera and as I was waiting for him said object shot to the west. The object moved from 0 mph to out of sight in less than one second. If I had blinked I would thought it had just vanished but, it moved so fast it actually left a trail of darkness behind it as if it were a tracer. I have never seen anything move that fast in the daylight. The best way I could even describe the speed is to say it left a line in the sky as it shot westward.

The time was around 9:30PM - 10:00PM. We were driving to Millen Georgia on I-25 if I remember correctly around Portal when we observed what we believe to be multiple UFOs.  This wasn't the first time, I had seen a very similar thing close to that area as a child maybe 10-15 years ago.  You can see from the map on this link exactly where the sighting took place between I-16 and Millen somewhere on I-25 heading north from I-16... http://www.flashearth.com/?lat=32.554451&lon=-81.86212&z=10.8&r=0&src=msl   What was seen cannot be described any other way but very ominous, for me anyway.  I was looking straight ahead at the road through the front windshield and didn't notice anything.  I was in the middle of conversation when my mother, who was driving, said ""Hey, is that a UFO?"" jokingly.  It was directly in my line of sight however I didn't seem to see anything until she said something.  When I focused my eyes I began to see Orange/redish or more like golden colored lights in the sky.  Roughly 2 or 3, although she had been looking longer and counted 5 or 6, approximatly 300 to 600 yards high off the ground.   As I had just glanced and only witnessed 2 or 3 for no more than 5-8 seconds, they all simply faded out at the same exact time.  The odd thing is that it couldn't have been clouds covering them because they all did it simultaneously and they were approximately 2 or 3 miles from each other, spread apart throughout the sky in front of us. My mother claimed that the other ones that I had not seem did the same thing a few seconds earlier.  Then another golden light appeared maybe 2 or 3 minutes later to our front/left.  It was very high up at first and only visible for a few seconds then faded out, far too high to be a light tower.  Then this proccess repeated with no noticeable pattern of timing with only 1 golden light for about the next 10 minutes.  I do some photo minipulation and 3D work for my career so I know distances, angles, and optical illusions very well and this was no illusion.  As we got closer it began to appear lower and lower to the ground, another indication it was not a light tower. It never got under maybe 90 ft from the ground though.  The last time we saw it, it was on the left side of I-25 going north and about 1 mile to the left I believe.  It would disappear, then suddenly appear again in its quite unique golden color for about half a minute or so in different places and appeared to be completely still then it would fade out again.  It was very steady, no pulsing just faded in then out again.  I later relayed this info to some family members who live in the area and they said that they had seen some very similar things at other times as well around there. Another interesting detail is that the very next night an extremely severe Lightning storm occurred in that same area. Literally the most severe Electrical Storm I have ever encountered. The thunder was loud enough to cause the entire house to tremble, and it had a sharpness to it that a .44 magnum revolver couldn't reproduce if it went off right next to your head. I've heard that many sightings take place just before or after very severe lightning storms.  One of the reasons this was so ominous to me is that I had recently had a dream of seeing a large UFO only a week earlier, which is not a common dream for me. In the dream seeing this UFO was so daunting that it terrified me and I awoke, a dream I'll not soon forget. On many occasions I have made predictions from my dreams that I discussed with people that later came true, this dream had a similar feeling so I did discuss this with my mother before the sighting took place. In the dream my mother was next to me on my left just as she was during the sighting.  I reported this on another website as well, and someone had a very similar sighting with lights of the same color and character only 30-40 miles south of that location in Jesup Georgia just 2 months before.

It reminded in the sky for a few seconds, then disappeared; poof it was gone.  Brief seconds later it reappeared in the same place then suddenly become two and moved apart slightly, then disappeared: poof gone. Brief seconds later the single light reappeared and then quickly blinked out.  There was no sound.  They seemed very far away  The lights were not the same red as lights on airplanes or helicopters.  My sister is in her mid- 40's, very intelligent, very down to earth.  I was surprised when she said, "" I saw them too.""   2.  Later, after 10 pm, my two sons (14 and 17) and my brother (early 40's) were sitting on the same 2nd floor porch looking towards the ocean.  My son (17) saw a large, saucer-ish shaped object, about the size of the moon only not the moon, not round, not white, but red on the outside, fading into bright yellow on the inside. It appeared out of nowhere. It slowly (but still in brief seconds) moved to the left and remained there for 2 seconds.  It slowly (but still in brief seconds) separated in 5 objects, reddish orange in color, saucer-ish shape.  but smaller than the original mass.  It was as though the large saucer-ish shaped light was covering the 5 smaller masses and it disappeared to uncover the 5 smaller things.  Then they disappeared from the outside in: they went from 5 to 3 to 1 to none.  My son (14) had the impression of a red light that "" looked sort of like fire"" that "" looked like it sort of came in"" and then "" went out.""   My brother was not looking in the same direction and missed all of this because happened so quickly.  My sons both have good heads on their shoulders as far as I know.  My brother is ultra logical.  I was down stairs.  My sons came and got me and I went back up to the porch. 3.  Now my 2 sons and my brother and I are sitting on the 2nd floor porch (between 10:30pm and 11pm), raptly studying the sky over the ocean.  After about 30 min. suddenly a large (moon sized) saucer-ish object came out of absolutely nowhere.  It was the reddish, orange color. No sound. It seemed to have movement, as thought it was vibrating or something.  It was there for seconds and then POOF! it was gone.  We were all amazed.

I didn't even stay focused on them because what I was seeing didn't make sense and I was trying to think up a logical explanation.  They then faded.

This is my description of a series of events that began in 1997, ceased for over a decade, and resumed just a few months ago in Sept. 2010.  I've hesitated to report these events previously but do so now in the hopes that others like me will find the courage to break their silence and to share their experiences.  A staggering number of individuals have reported the same phenomena elsewhere online, and many have posted incredible footage on Youtube of what I'm about to describe.  Although I have not filmed the phenomena myself (yet), I can attest that the footage posted by users such as SeeingUFOsPA, Alienphotog, and Purvashadastar are true to what I've witnessed myself.  I do not personally know these users, and I cite their videos only as further evidence of my witness testimony. Here's a synopsis of my experiences. I've intentionally excluded certain details that I'd be willing to discuss confidentially with MUFON investigators but do not wish to disclose in this forum or to third parties.   Here are the basics:   It began on a late July evening in 1997 in Northumberland Co, PA, when I peered out my open window on an overcast night, as I often did, and looked skyward.  I recall the time was about 1:00 a.m. In a period of time that spanned no more than one second at most, I saw an anomalous light strobe three times at three different points in the sky and disappear.  I felt certain that it was one light that had moved to three different points in the sky and had strobed three times at each point, rather than three different lights that strobed in succession, probably because the points were somewhat close to each other instead of at opposite sides of the sky. I estimated the altitude of the light to be no more than that of a low-flying, small plane, although it could have been much closer than that. In any case, I was practicing a religion at the time, I did not believe in extraterrestrials, and I was also an avid sky-watcher who had never witnessed anything like this, so this anomalous event knocked me for a loop and scared me terribly!  Although it seems humorous in retrospect, I recall that I slept with the light on and with religious objects near my bed (and with my window closed) for several subsequent nights. I pushed the event to the farthest corners of my mind, although it never quite escaped my memory. Thirteen years passed, my belief systems changed greatly during that time, and I had opened myself to the likelihood of abundant, advanced intelligent life in this universe and countless other universes. Probably due to my 1997 experience, my interest was piqued when I read reviews of the recently released book by journalist Leslie Kean titled, ""UFOs."" I bought the book and finished it in September 2010. It fascinated me, and I began to familiarize myself with the works and writings of various schools of thought on the subject, major researchers, groups, contactees, etc., trying to distinguish the real from the fake. I truly believe that this ""primed"" me for what happened next. That is, I think that the whole reason for my most recent sightings is that I had grown in awareness enough to be able to absorb and process the experiences. I'm getting ahead of my story here, but suffice it to say that these events are purposeful and often interactive. Consciousness is key. Back to my account:  One evening in the last week of September 2010 in Northumberland Co., I was out for a walk/jog, which is routine for me in the warm months. At the time, sundown was somewhere between 7 and 7:30 p.m. I was walking/jogging toward the beautiful sunset, thinking about extraterrestrials, the books and literature I had just read, etc. Very few clouds were in the sky. All of a sudden, I noticed an incredibly bright light in sunset. Too bright to be a star, as it shone with such a magnitude that it was not obscured by the brilliant sun. Plus, it appeared to be emanating from within the Earth's atmosphere at about the altitude of a small plane. The light was a peach color, like the color of the sunset. It was stationary. I laughed at myself, because I was caught off-guard by this light after just finishing the UFO book and reading all about UFOs. I figured that my imagination was running away with me, and I chided myself, thinking that I had mistaken the reflection of the sun gleamin! g off a plane, or the headlight of an approaching plane, for an anomalous light. The fact was, though, that this light remained stationary for at least the 15 minutes that I walked/jogged in its direction, except for a few times when it moved slightly to the right or slightly to the left. It also faded in and out--faded to a pinprick, then it would suddenly reappear and pulse brightly, then fade out, disappear, reappear, etc. Again, there were no clouds in the sky. Despite all this, I convinced myself that it was nothing that couldn't be explained, and I didn't think anything further of it . . . until my next walk/jog a few days later, when it appeared again at the exact same place in the sky while I was thinking about UFOs. Again, it faded in and out (not rhythmically--just randomly), moved here and there a bit, but just generally hovered. It was close enough to me that I would have seen a craft/shape if it were an ultralight, glider, plane, certainly a balloon, parachuter, kite, etc. On this second occasion, I paid closer attention and ""knew"" that . . . I was seeing exactly what I thought I was seeing. I didn't feel fear--only immense curiosity and a certain sense of hopefulness and excitement. I tried to mentally ""talk"" with the thing. On subsequent walks, I may have even received rudimentary, yet personalized, messages back (although this is difficult to ""prove,"" so I will exclude the details here.)  I should also mention that I reported seeing the anomalous light to my family members, who live next door and who do not believe even in the remotest possibility of extraterrestrials or sky phenomena originating from other beings. On the morning after I had a sighting of the amber light, my father reported that a ""helicopter"" had landed atop the mountain about half a mile from our homes, observed about 6:00 a.m. as he was heading to work. When I pressed for more details, he told me that he did not actually see a helicopter, but that the saw extremely bright lights that appeared to be landing atop the mountain. His interpretation was that someone lived up there and may have needed helicopter transportation to a hospital. I have not been able to confirm or refute this--I only mention it because he did not see a craft (only lights) and because of the next part of my story. After the sightings of the bright, anomalous, peachy light during the last week of September and first week of October 2010, I stopped going for evening walks as it became too dark to do so. I also had a series of urgent matters to take care of, and I ceased to even think about UFOS for over a month. I began to think about them again during the past week or two, perhaps to take my mind off other things, and that's when the most incredible part of my story began. It was on or about November 17, 2010, when I was driving home from work (I commute 135 miles daily by car, mostly through rural areas). I was in Dauphin Co. at the time, skywatching while driving (unsafe, I know), when a weird light caught my eye. It seemed stationary, like a stationary plane light. I had to keep looking back at the road between my views of it. At one point, when I looked back at it, I saw that it was a plane. I was somewhat disappointed and kept driving. When I reached a particular part of my commute (a small village in lower Northumberland Co.), I noticed an IMMENSELY BRIGHT light in the sky, hovering not far above tree-top level--perhaps a few hundred yards up, like the size of a small plane about to touch down in a few minutes, but lit up like a rocket!!! It was ridiculously bright, and the brightness completely obscured the rest of the craft. It was a long cigar (horizontally shaped, like an airplane lit up from wingtip to wingtip) of incredible brightness, just HOVERING, ""looking"" right at me!! The brightness did not increase, decrease, or move--it was definitely HOVERING, or else moving at such a slow speed that it would have dropped from the sky if it were a typical plane. By this time, I had slowed down to about 40 miles an hour. A car approached in the opposite lane, I took my eyes off the ""thing,"" and when I looked at it again, this time I saw just two incredibly bright ""headlights"" and two fainter lights on the wingtips of what appeared to be a plane. It had begun to move toward me, but at a ridiculously slow pace. It flew over me, from left to right. My thoughts during the event were initially ""What the H*** is THAT?"" Just baffled curiosity, ting! ed with breathless excitement, and then a bit of a sheepish, confused feeling after I saw the ""plane.""  When I arrived home, I spoke with my father again and relayed what I had seen, because I felt like I needed to tell someone. I was astounded when he casually informed me that he, too, had seen a bright ""plane"" that seemed to hover or fly unusually slowly. He saw it in the EXACT SAME LOCATION as I did, and the object behaved exactly the same: it flew over him from left to right. He didn't tell me when the event occurred, but it must have been months ago, as he does not normally travel along that road. ""It was a plane,"" he said, with a tone of finality. I didn't try to convince him otherwise. A day or two later, I took an alternate route home from work due to an accident along my regular route, and I traveled through Dauphin and Schuylkill Counties. While I was waiting in a line of traffic to access I-81 N, I noticed the same ""hovering plane"" type of light in the sky among the other stars, airplanes, and jets. Its faintly peachy color gave it away. I stared at it for a long time, waiting in traffic. As I did, I noticed VERY FAINT strobe-like lights that seemed to emanate from it and travel around it. For whatever reason, I once again wrote it off as a star with extremely distant jets in close alignment with it. I continued to travel north. I looked at ""it"" once while driving on the interstate, and I thought I saw a contrail in the moonlight behind it, which befuddled (and disappointed) me yet again. I swear I saw the amber/peachy light again near a shopping center that I stopped at on my way home in Schuylkill Co. (At the time, I was just dismissing everything I saw, so it's hard to recall details now in retrospect.) Then, after I left the shopping center, I witnessed almost a repeat of the previous event in lower Northumberland Co.: a bright (but not nearly as bright as before) light seemed to hover, then ""morph"" into a plane-like object before proceeding to slowly fly over me from left to right! Because I was on a highway, I lost sight of the object after it flew over me and was behind me and behind trees surrounding the highway. The most recent encounter(s) I had were on Nov. 22 or Nov. 23 after work. I left work at 5:00 p.m. in Dauphin Co. and proceeded to walk several blocks to my car. I saw a very, very strange looking ""helicopter,"" complete with helicopter sound, flying right past me over the parking lot. I couldn't see the shape of the helicopter very well, but it appeared to have a bright green light on top and a red light on the bottom. This one may have been a domestic or military craft--I'm not saying it was unexplainable, just that I had never seen a light configuration like that before. I proceeded to drive toward a shopping center in Cumberland Co. While waiting in traffic, I saw the amber/peachy orb-like thing again in the sunset, facing me. It looked at first like a plane approaching, but as I sat there in traffic for a good ten minutes or so, I realized that it was not increasing in size in the slightest, nor was it decreasing, fading, pulsing, or otherwise moving. It was, however, glimmering--dancing, even--in an odd way, more so than the typical glimmer of a star in the sky. It seemed to be multi-colored at times. Finally, as traffic cleared and I drove across a bridge toward the light, it began to approach, take the form of a plane, and turn to my right at a 90 degree angle. I took my eye off it to watch the road, looked back, and all of a sudden, this thing flew RIGHT-TO-LEFT, right over me! It had done a complete 180 in the second or two that I had taken my eyes off the road. Despite all this, I was just left feeling bad because these objects were merely planes, and I was seemingly incapable of identifying them as such. I thought I was perhaps misidentifying things. After some shopping in Cumberland and Dauphin Counties, I proceeded home. While in upper Dauphin Co., in the area where I had previously seen a hovering light, I noticed a very odd-looking ""plane."" Instead of the typical white light ""strobe"" that domestic craft have, this plane's strobe light ""fluttered"" in a bizarre way. I'm sorry that I cannot describe it better than that. Suffice it to say, it was an abnormal type of strobe that I had never seen before. Again, I'm not completely convinced that this particular one wasn't just a regular plane with a broken light or something. Finally, when I had reached the part of my commute through lower Northumberland County, in the EXACT SAME PLACE that I had first seen the bright, cigar-shaped-light-turned-hovering-plane, and in the EXACT SAME PLACE that my father had seen something similar, I SAW IT AGAIN!!! It wasn't as bright this time, but it was bright, peachy-colored, and hovering on the opposite bank of the Susquehanna River. I mentally asked it to come closer, to show me what it really looked like. At this point, I was driving about 35 mph and looking for a place to pull over. I suspected that this was the ""real deal,"" and I wanted an opportunity for me to observe it without moving. I pulled over at the first opportunity and opened my window. I had lost view of the light behind some trees for a bit but soon saw it through the tree tops, slowly making its way toward me (it was flying about a few hundred yards up in the air from left to right again). Finally, it cleared the trees, and I stuck my head out the window and saw it: It was a small, low-flying jet/plane, complete with plane-like sound, much to my consternation. When I arrived home, I performed internet searches on ""hovering planes"" and ""UFOs that become planes."" This led me to the videos of many Youtubers who have been observing and capturing these things for quite some time. The usernames I mentioned above are just a few who have posted videos of EXACTLY what I saw: peachy orbs/lights that morph into plane-like objects. Some of the videos even show daylight footage. I cannot emphasize enough that THESE ARE LEGIT, and I encourage anyone even remotely interested to take a look. I thought I was a really poor witness until I viewed these videos, at which point I almost wept when I realized that others have seen what I've seen. The ""orange orb/fake-plane UFO"" thing is real, it's prevalent, and many of us are witnessing it, worldwide. As for my opinion about what these are and why they're here (for what it's worth): I believe they're extraterrestrial in origin. Not sure whether they're ""manned,"" as it were, or perhaps just probes or holograms. They don't appear to do anything except observe, and, occasionally, interact. They seem to appear when one thinks about them, almost exclusively on clear nights. I believe that they are simply trying observe and to spread awareness of their existence at a grass-roots-level. They are both bold and cautious--they're undaunted by urban areas, where they can blend in, but rural areas and daylight seem to be no big deals, either. I would love to know why there are so many of these, and why ""they"" seem to want to be noticed. Thanks for the opportunity to provide my personal account of this phenomenon.

The object seemed much smaller than most jets I’ve seen flying at such a high altitude. The sun hadn’t come up at this point so the sky was clear and somewhat grayish in color.

Near around what I presume to be 8:00 p.m. on 11-24-10 driving home in a blizzard in the Chippewa National Forest I saw a flaming fireball in the sky.  At first it was distant and flickering.  And as it got closer it looked like a flame, not a sharp acute flame but more like a candle.  This had what seemed to be a spherical shell around it, like a translucent halo. It moved in a very slow almost ballon type way. I had to stop my vehicle on the side of the road and watch it.  It came down to what seemed to be very close, but there was no way of judging size, because it was night, and a blizzard making visabilty poor as well.  But I know what I saw was not a civilian aircraft, it had no directional lights of any kind, and the conditions were so poor the Emergency Helicopter base was shut down for the night.  When I shut the vehicle off and rolled down the windows, I heard no sound, it actually floated over toward me, (or what I pr! esume was toward me it was hard to tell), in this odd bobbing fashion.  It then gained altitude slowly and disapeared into the snow filled, North-Western night sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This event happened when I was about 14 in '58.   My mother was at work.  She was a hairdresser and worked downtown; my father had died in 1955.  It was Sat. and I called mom to see when she'd be home.   As I did, I looked out the screen door.  Being summer, the trees were full.  Out the edge of some trees, I saw something that did not belong.  I just hung up with no answer and slowly walked outside.   My uncle had a lake in that direction and this object was just coming out of the pines.  I walked into the dirt road keeping my attention to the sky.  In about a minute, I could see the object completelt.  It was going slowly with no sound at all.  I could estimate the size from the trees it was above.  It was long (about 200 to 300 ft.) and was a sideways teardrop shape, bigger at one end.  It was definitely not a weather balloon. I watched in awe as it made transit.  The color was a dim orange and still no sound.  This is the first and only time I have related this to an organization.  Sorry it took so long to report this.

I was a young girl and the word UFO, nor the idea of UFOs, was not in vocabulary. It was summer, the windows were open for ventilation and it was later than 10 PM at night. I couldn’t sleep because of the heat, so I moved to the foot of the bed and lay with my head and shoulders in the window.  Our house was stucco, with a flat roof.  There were no street lights in our town at that time.  I had checked out the neighborhood, listened to the sounds and was cooling off.  I heard a soft beep, beep, beep, with the beeps separated by 2 or 3 seconds.  I couldn’t find the source of the sound.  It was new to me.  There were no vehicles, at that time, with back-up beepers.   I rolled around inside the window trying to locate the sound and had finally settled on my back, watching the stars in a dark sky.  There was no moon that night. From the corner of my right eye, to the east of the house, I saw something move.  The beeping sound was right on top of me.  I turned my head and saw a very large silver sphere.  The sphere had spires at equal distances, all over the area I could see, perhaps 10 to 12 spires.  Lights were on the ends of every spire.  Some were blue, some white, some red.  The beep and white lights seemed to pulse in unison.  None of the red or blue lights went out when the white ones pulsed brighter and dimmer. I think I was in about the 5th grade, because I knew about the Russian satellite being launched  and that the United States was about to/or had just launched our own.  I remember thinking, ""Oh, that’s what a satellite looks like.""  I didn’t know that a large round ‘thing’ couldn’t fly, telephone pole high, with no motor sounds, no landing gear and no noticeable speed. I rolled over and watched it go out of sight, over the lights of Roby, ten miles away.  I could hear the beeping sound for about 30 minutes, from start to finish. I have always wondered what it was, but only told friends about it 6 years later.  I wasn’t worried about it, just assumed that it was a satellite. Are you able to tell me what it was?

The sun had not yet set, so there was ample light.  The rectangular craft was about 6-7 ft tall, 30 ft wide, 50 ft long without colors or markings.  I was able to see good detail - there were no seams anywhere. There were no outside lights or FRONT windows. The front and back of the craft angled out 2-3 degrees at the base (pylon).  There were no sharp corners, the edges were rounded and smooth.  There were 3 round (portholes) windows approximately 2.5 ft in diameter evenly spaced on the side I could see.   Instead of racing to get a camera, I stayed to observe.  Feeling scared, I looked into the windows which were emitting a dark yellow (not amber or orange) light from the far interior of the craft.  I saw no people, aliens etc.   Relieved, I assumed it was military and headed to Fort Riley (Junction City, Ks).  I would just like to know if anyone, anywhere has seen this same craft?

I received this report through the online report form on this site.  I have met with the witness who wishes to remain anonymous due to his position as a doctor in the community.  The witness was very adamant that he saw what he described and seemed like a very level headed man.  This is a preliminary report on this sighting and there will be follow ups posted as more information becomes available to the OUFOR2.  Below is the information from the online sighting report. Date of sighting: 7/24/2010   Event time: 11:45pm   Event duration: 2 minutes   Altitude of craft: 500 to 1000 feet   Approximate size of craft: 100 to 200 feet across the flat sides ( Equilateral triangle)    (Weather conditions added by OUFOR2 after researching)  Weather conditions: Clear skies, moon lit night.

I saw 3 whitish lights moving towards me ( to the east ) at what I thought was about 500 to 1000 feet in the air. As it drew closer I was able to make out the crafts shape as triangular in fashion. It drifted slowly over head and away to the northeast and seemed to speed up the further it got from me until it was gone. There was no sound that I could hear and my dog did not react to it at all. I would like to know what this may have been, but, due to my being a doctor I request to be kept anonymous in the public eye. Contact info withheld by request of the witness. Initial findings:  I met with the witness on 7/28/2010 in the park and asked him a barrage of the usual questions and from first impressions I found him to be a stable intelligent man without an agenda or any obvious deceptive statements.  He seemed truly perplexed and concerned about the sighting and was not making any rash statements about it being an alien craft or a craft of known origins. He seemed fairly savvy on the local ( usual ) air traffic in his neighborhood too.  He did repeat several times that “ It was like nothing I have every seen before.  The OUFOR2 will be conducting further checks with the FAA at the PDX tower and also by contacting the Oregon Air National Guard at PDX as well. OUFOR2 has already checked the weather conditions for the sighting date and has confirmed that the witnesses statement and the official weather conditions match. Shown below are views of the location via map and also forensic models built to illustrate the witnesses sighting.  The witness has viewed the forensic reconstruction models and has agreed that they closely represent what he viewed that night. There has been added detail to the forensic model from information that the witness expounded upon during our interview.  These models are NOT 100% accurate as to what may have been witnessed since there was only one witness and no photographs or videos taken.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,45.41070557768924,-122.70941713147411

The light did not seem to produce a noise, though it was difficult to know since I could only hear the sound of the plane's engines.  After it trailed the plane for a short time, the ball of light veered off in a northerly direction, and at times flew erraticly (suddenly slowing down, then speeding up). I estimate the light was traveling at least twice as fast as the plane. I continued to track the ball of light until it faded into the clouds in the north.  It was obvious to me that this ball of light was not another airplane, considering it was not displaying blinking lights, nor was it at a safe distance between the plane I was observing. This incident has great significance to me, especially having read about the increase in ""fireball"" reports recently.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,31.7923281835206,-106.3748488764045

It was while he was doing this that he happened to glance up into the sky and off towards the south-southeast and saw what seemed to be two distinct and very brilliant orange colored lights in the sky at probably not more than one-quarter mile from his observation point. According to the observer, the lights were flying vertically across the sky, with one trailing the other at a distance, estimated by the witness to be between six hundred and one thousand yards, and at an angle of approximately fifty degrees above the horizon.  Suddenly, the leading light source terminated its forward motion and made a sheer vertical acceleration, vanishing into the sky.

My balcony faces Northeast towards Nellis Airforce Base in Las Vegas, NV, and has a clear view of the northeastern section of sky.  As I smoke, I frequently watch planes landing or taking off from Mcarren Airport, or I watch aircraft fly to and from Nellis.  On August 27th around 3 p.m. I was on my balcony, and I noticed right away that a plane was approaching Las Vegas from the North. Whats interesting about that is Ive learned through months of everyday observing that planes do not fly in from the North, so I picked up my binoculars (used for watching the planes and helicopters fly from Nellis) and saw that it was one of those ""Janet"" planes that transport employees to and from Area 51 (Classic red stripe passenger plane with no identifiable markings). As I followed the plane with my binoculars, I then noticed something appear in my field of vision that was further away beyond the! Janet plane. I stopped and adjusted my binocs to get a clearer image of what this object was, and once I did I could see a white, solid, dome shaped object hovering in place far off in the distance. I know distances can be deceiving, so I dont want to say how far away i think it was exactly, but I can say it was miles, beyond Sunrise mountain and perhaps even Lake Mead. I stood and watched it for 2-3 minutes until I noticed another Janet plan coming into approach at McCarran. I took my eyes off the craft for only a second and when I scanned the area it had been, it was gone! I searched the entire sky for about 20 minutes and never saw it again. It was dome shaped, white and never moved from the spot I first saw it. I assume that it was far away, and if it was then I would say the craft was huge. Being stationary, I was able to study it for 2-3 minutes through my binoculars and though it was too far to make out any details, I can say it was big enough to clearly make out it! s shape. I am absolutely certain that it was not a plane, heli! copter, weather balloon, or any other craft Ive ever seen in my life. It was a clear, hot summer day with no clouds in sight. I hope you find this information useful. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.  PD))",2010-08-24T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

It is for real and I have hundreds of photos to prove it. I have been watching UFO activity in the same exact area for a year and a half and have taken pictures of them and gotten very strange stuff…not always the same…yet one repeats over and over. The objects are moving at times but remain in the same place for long period of times other times. Most people take movies if they take anything at all. Some think it is the best way to keep from being a hoax…although those too have proved a lot of time to be fake. I have put my Nikon 300 camera with a 20-200 telephoto lens on a tripod and used a cable cord for shutter release. I’ve put the ASA on 1600 and cranked it even to 3500. I’ve seen stationary lights…flashing strobe lights,.. bright flashing or blinking lights, ..flickering lights…and three nights ago actually saw a craft for a split second. One light came on, ..then another next to it and continued like that in a zooming fashion from one end to the other and then stayed unlashing for split second and then simply disappeared. It was so fast I couldn’t count the number of lights but I would say 15-20! It looks like what I have many still shots of in my photos. The images in the photos were picked up by my camera and I did not see the images themselves until looking at what had been taken…They come out about the size of a pin head on the camera but I can crop in to ‘bring them up a bit on the camera. Sometimes they will enlarge to only the size of a small fingernail.. other times to the size of a thumb nail.. and then every once in a while it will fill the whole screen of the back of the camera. Friends of mine in the area saw my shots and recently they were up at midnight and went outside to see all kinds of colored blinking lights. The shots they got with their point and shoot camera were very strange too. I got four different sightings last year and at least ten this year…seven just in the past week. There might have been many more times but I freaked out and didn’t look so I wouldn’t see more. Then something happened in broad day light Oct.31 this year and I began watching again. I have photographed five tiny lights moving all over the sky and the some darting off one direction ,one another and one stayed …then 2- three came back.When I cropped them they looked like a gol darn kids amusement park! They had images of a ‘dolls shoe’ with antennas out the front …and other equally strange images…  I have gotten things that to me remind me of a Roman coin(why I think that I don’t know) and in the past week I’ve gotten a ‘lot’ of them. I saw a triangle in the sky and showed thee lights.. the other night I saw a triangle of lights but it had three lights on the sides and along the back, with a red one on the one corner. When I enlarged the photo after I got them made, the lights are round with a ?antenna/ or protrusion out front. THE MOST RECENT ARE OF ACTUAL ‘AIRPLANE’ TYPE THINGS BUT ARE BARS WITH LIGHTS…One has a top and bottom bar with the lights in between. I was out there for an hour taking the ‘blinking’ lights and at first thought it was a four second exposure maybe catching the line of blinks. However I saw only a white flash and the bars of light have maybe a single white light then a red, then three white, and a red and maybe two white…the pattern doesn’t hold true. Then the other night I realized it wasn’t a four second delay to take the picture…it was ‘there was nothing to take in the dark night sky but the second it flashed the camera went off. That was discovered when I SAW the craft the one time for  split second and it matches some of my photos. There must have been 7-10 to12 objects those nights and they were different. I have pictures of them all. (Good pictures)Right now I still have some of the disc/coin ones on my camera…and a few round  dimensional balls)  I have contacted people but the local paper put in the first one last year and I don’t know if they are spooked to do any more or think I can’t be seeing this much and am a kook. People around this area have seen these for at least six years and don’t know what it is ,..try to explain it with logic ..think it’s our government stuff…or are too afraid to tell anyone. (I have an appointment with the local guy of investigation and home land security Monday to put to rest that our government doesn’t have stuff going on but with the images and so many going in different directions at the same time and the weird shapes etc…it’s NOT ours. I’ve been very frustrated because either no one will pay any attention as 3-   to it being real, or the government has ‘hushed them up’. I sent photos to the Bristle Tn. T.V. station and they replied back they had no idea what it is..and they would check…I’ve heard nothing!!! (Someone else I know said they had contacted the Johnson City t.v. station years ago about the lights in this same area and they did do a segment…The guy that did it got fired shortly afterward ..they don’t know if it was from covering that or not.)  Tonight I was laying in bed and the thought of looking up ‘UFO reporting’  on the computer came to my head. Last year I had a local Mufon guy out when the first sighting  hit the newspaper but if it’s not a ‘triangle’ or ‘little green men’. .they aren’t interest.  Guess UFO’s have to fit ‘their’ thinking rather than the fact that there are plenty others out there…‘I’ can attest to that. With what I’ve been picturing and seeing I know why Our planes who have chased ‘strange crafts’ can’t catch them. It’s NOT that the crafts are faster than ours as much as it is that they can disappear within a shield. I’ve seen it.I’ve also seen the ‘coins/crafts/discs ???? at different stages and know how they are formed. I know this is unbelievable but truth is stranger than fiction…besides,.. who would make up such far fetched stuff if it was a hoax they want someone to ‘believe’. The UFO’S are ‘hidden in plain sight’…They have the people to thank for not being discovered. With people faking stuff, ..causing a hoax and non believers who try to rationalize it, the UFO’S are free to reign unbothered. ..but are they aliens from ‘outer space’ or another country with things invading us in our space ??? Either one, people put their heads in the sand and won’t get serious to find out…..if they don’t admit it it doesn’t exist! Some day it might be too late. I personally am ‘not’ into UFO’S.

Weather was clear, the wind was still, and the moon not yet up.  I noticed a very bright, stationary yellow-white light low over the Santa Rita Mountains, probably about twice as bright as Venus at its brightest, but a bit larger.  It was at 25 degrees (about NNE) from my position, and appeared to be a few miles north of Mount Hopkins (elevation 8900’), but clearly above the horizon defined by the jagged mountain range.  I would estimate the altitude of the light at about 8-10 thousand feet.   The light dimmed quickly within 20 seconds of my going outside, and disappeared.   About 10 minutes later, the light reappeared for about 30 seconds, then dimmed within a few seconds and disappeared. While looking around the sky after I initially saw the light over the Santa Ritas, I noted two separate fixed dots of bright amber light to the SW, very low to the ground (less than 300 feet above the terrain, which is rolling) if not nearly on the ground.  Each was of similar size and brightness as the light over the Santa Ritas.  There are no lights so bright, nor of that color, in that direction normally.   I could not readily discern a shape other than roundish.  They were less than 4 miles away, as they blocked out the lights from cars on I-19 from my view.  I estimate that the two amber lights must have been a quarter of a mile to a half mile from one another, using the light spread across a nearby residential area to judge the distance.   After a minute or so of watching these lights, I saw them slowly dim, over a minute or more. After the second appearance of the light over the Santa Ritas, and its disappearance, I looked back to the SW, and saw a line of at least 5 bright amber lights, between here and Rio Rico Villas 14 (about 1.5 miles away to the SW), but just to the south of both.  The lights were not as bright nor as big as the two amber lights I witnessed just a few minutes before, but still startlingly bright for the area.  They were still extremely low to the ground. I could see them moving in a perfect, unwavering horizonal line, apparently heading northward, and without changing altitude despite going across rolling terrain.  The line of lights moved relatively slowly, probably under 50 mph (judging from how fast the freeway traffic in the far distance moved).  I heard no noise (I can hear the UPS truck or a noisy pickup truck a mile away, and large trucks on the freeway 3.5 miles away, as this is a quiet area, and in a valley).  I saw no other color lights, nor any sign of headlights.  I! watched them for about 10 seconds.  At this point I went inside (at about 9:45 pm MST). There are some enclaves/military reservations to the north of the Santa Rita Mountains, near Green Valley, that might explain the light that appeared (from my vantage point) over the Santa Ritas.  However, there are no military lands closeby to the West and Southwest  (between here and the freeway).  This latter area is a barely developed but platted and roaded rural residential area.  A mile or so past it in the same direction lies the Coronado National Forest and mountain ranges. I saw no helicopter lights near the Santa Ritas tonight, and that is odd.  Usually, there are one or two stationary over that range and/or to the south of that range.  This is the borderlands, and I presume some Federal Agency (military, INS, or DEA) has the helicopters in place.  The presumptive helicopters appear small and dim, the size and brightness of a run of the mill star, but an occasional red flash gives them away, as well as their eventual movement out of position in a manner consistent with how a helicopter moves.  Have spotted the helicopters nightly for years. Two of my cordless phones did not work/could not get a dialtone when I tried to call in my observation at the time of the sighting.  On average, I have trouble with my landline that is not attributable to a widespread outage on less than one day each year.  I called in on my cell phone which functioned normally.   When I tried my two cordless phones again about 15' later, both worked. Note that on Sept. 23, 2010, I filed a report regarding a more extensive and lengthy sighting, in the same general region.   Until that night I had never seen anything unusual in the sky, despite spending at least 20 minutes outside on most nights.  Local TV stations received a flood of calls about the event in the Tucson Metro area on Sept. 23, especially from the South and West sides of town, but no one else filed a report.  On that night, there were very clear conditions as well, and no wind either.  Furthermore, on both nights (Sept. 23td and tonight) lights appeared at one location, followed by the appearance of lights at a second distinct location, and then again, as if some sort of back and forth signaling or communication is going on.

I was in the 9th grade in high school at the time of this siteing.  It was apx 8:00 am on a weekend when we were called outside by a neighbor to observe this object.  The object was circular and glowed an ultra-violet blue w/a solid black center.  The object was stationary directly over us and although located in the fast moving broken cloud cover it did not move.   We watched the object for apx 30-45 minutes.   There was a camo colored twin engine Air Force jet which came from the southeast and flew by the object.  We could clearly see the exhaust from the jet as it came towards the object.   When the jet was apx 200-300 ft. from the object the exhaust smoke cut off and the jet glided past on one side and the exhaust resumed when the jet was apx the same distance past it.   The jet made a circle and the same thing happened as the jet passed on the opposite side of the object.  The jet at that time left the area heading back to the southeast.  The object was apx 3-4 times ! the size of the jet.   The official Air Force report was that the object was a weather balloon.  There was a lot of media calls about it.   This beggs 2 questions from me that did not make any sense. (1)  How could a weather balloon stay stationary for all of the time we were watching it in the wind?  (2)  Why would the Air Force send an observation jet to look at a weather balloon?    I looked up the jet in the library and it was a state of the art photo-recon jet of the time.   I will never know what it really was but it would be nice if the Air Force would release the ""TRUE"" photos that the jet had taken.

I was a young boy probably around 7 years old. I was walking back home with my friend coming from his house on a dead end street (Corral & Birtha street)   When we reach the front of my house and sidewalk we noticed a huge round object hovering directly over us.  No sound, I can not explain how huge this was.  We had to actually move our heads back and fourth to see the entire object at one point.  It was rotating with multiple colored lights.  From our vantage point directly under it, it seemed to be like a spoke in a wheel.  The outer edges seemed to be rotating around the center and changing colors as it did that.   Suddenly the object shot straight up in a flash, hardly even able to distinguish between it and stars other than the color looked more orange from the distanced view.  We ran inside to tell my mother and finally we convinced her to come outside to see it.  By that time other neighbors was outside too looking at it.  The object had came back down to it's original position but occasionally would maneuver up, down or left or right and even diagonally.  Some times fast and sometimes slow.  The second time it shot up and was ha! rdly distinguishable between the stars other than the color difference.   We all went back inside and my mother called the police and reported it.  She also called the Air force. Moments later it was on the news on TV.  Wier Cook Airport at the time ( Now Indianapolis International ) had sent 2 fighter jets to intercept it.  We went back outside a third time and seen the jets heading towards the object. Suddenly the object shot straight upwards again so fast... but this time it disappeared completely out of view.  The news that evening said the Air force identified it as being a blown off course weather balloon. The next day it was in the news papers also.  A few day's later me and my friend was walking along side the road in the middle of the day and a blue car and 2  men in air force uniforms stopped us and asked if we saw anything strange in the sky. We told them about it as they took notes.  Then they drove away. I never head anything more about this.  Now I am 46 and still remember it so vividly. I tried researching the news archives without success. If anyone else who witnessed this please post here.  Obviously it was not a blown off course weather balloon. We do not chase weather balloons with fighter jets... I might add... they couldn't catch it...lol  I just wish I could find some archives or documentation on this.

I was down by the lake when I saw what I thought was a shooting star, but as I watched it,it stoped.  I was puzzled because a shooting star doesnt just stop in mid air.   As I watched it turned into a round glow and started moving very slowly toward us.  When it was streaking like a star it seems very far away, but when it turned into this glow it seemed to be very close very fast, althought it seemed to be moving very slow.  I was so stunned I ran to the boat dock and started yelling for everyone to come and see this.   Then 2 of my sons came running down as the craft started to have pulsating lights that were rotating around the craft.

I didn't know anything about ufo reporting until watching a ufo show on tv.  The Community was Glen Rose outside of Malvern.  I'm not sure what time it was or day, it was night and I had taken my poodle, ""Cuddle's,"" outside to do his thing. Something drew my attention to what looked like a star, but watching it for I don't know how long, I realized the ""star"" was too close to the ground.   I continued watching, again I don't know how long I watched this; I went into the house and got my two daughters and my eldest daughter's boy friend to come outside and look at this thing.   We stood on the porch again watching, what looked like a star, don't know how long we stood there, finallly I remember saying it was moving, then I thought it was a helicopter that was moving toward us.  Everything seemed slow.  The thing, was coming near, there was no sound, we watched as the object went almost directly over us, no sound, there was the white light at the front, with blue or green lights and it seems a red light somewhere, it has been so long ago to remember the details.  It was triangular shape. Ater this:  I read a book about UFO's and it had the triangular ufo's mentioned like we saw on this summer night.   I wrote the author and to my surprise he wrote back, I had told the author I had these small encaved objects on my skin, like a doodle bug home, this was mentioned in his book.  The author told me he couldn't say if I had been abducted at some time but gave me some names of hypmotist in local states that I could see, he also said that this could be very tramautic to me, I decided not see anyone. I do still have the letter from the author but haven't searched for them yet, unless you would  like to see the documents. The UFO came from the west.

In October of 1985 I lived in a ranch style house in San Ramon, California, and I was looking out my front window when I saw something appear over the lip of the roof above me.  It was moving forward very slowly.  I ran out onto the front lawn and there was a round saucer directly above my house, about 50 feet in the air.  It was silver metallic and made no sound at all.  I ran back into the house and got my son who was 8 at the time.  We stood on the front lawn and watched in amazement as it silently passed over us and moved towards the strip mall across the street. It was large, about the size of my house.  Because of the strip mall and surrounding street lights we could see it very clearly.  It had a dome on the top and from the side we were on we counted twelve square blue lights so I figured there must have been 24 around the entire dome.  They would all go off and one by one come back on again.  At first I thought the lights might have been windows because of their shape but I tried to see inside and couldn’t see anything and then they went off which is when I realized they were lights. We stood there watching until it disappeared behind the strip mall which took about 5 minutes since it was only moving as fast as a person could walk.  I wish I had the sense to grab my camera and take pictures but it never occurred to me to do that because I was really in shock at seeing a UFO at all, especially up close.  The funny thing was we weren’t afraid of it, just in awe. Immediately after seeing it I called my husband who was away on a business trip in San Diego and told him and I also told one friend but never reported it or told anyone else because I thought they would say I was crazy.  My son is 33 now and we still talk about it.  I tell everyone now and don’t care if they believe me. I did read in the paper over the next few days that it was also seen later that night by one police officer on his beat, another police officer standing on his deck, and by a lady who was up feeding her newborn and saw it out her apartment window hovering over the bay.

In the mid to late afternoon on or near the date, May 8, 1989, on S. Laurel Street in Richmond, Virginia, I observed the following.   (I recall it being in the mid-spring, and I remember it being a Tuesday, however as it has been so many years I may be off by up to one year.  i.e. I lived at that address for one whole year.)  As I walked due south on Laurel Street from Carey Street towards my home I noticed a slightly shiny object hovering over the pyramid in Hollywood cemetery.  The pyramid is about 90 feet tall; therefore I estimated the object to be hovering at about 120 feet.  Since I knew I was only 3 blocks from the pyramid I estimated the object to be about 20-30 feet long and about 8-10 feet tall.  The width of the object was not easily estimable but the cigar shape it appeared to have indicated it may have been about 10 feet wide at most.  It hovered silently.  A cigar shaped object with no lights or windows visible and a finish that looked similar to “brushed steel”, with a slight grain or texture to the entire craft.  It seemed to have a pointed end and a slightly rounder end. As I stopped and stared, it began to move south in a straight path with no altitude change, towards the river which was less than a mile away, and near my home.  I walked at the same pace as it moved while it continued the south, slowly and silently.  Then it stopped and appeared to open a window or peephole on the side facing me.  (It was on my right)  It picked up speed, as if changing from one gear to the next instantly.  I began running to keep up with it and proceeded to seemingly keep up for two or three blocks, so it was still only going a few miles per hour.  Then in an instant, right before it was over the riverbank, it made an angled right turn which turned it about 20-30 degrees to the right (west) and about the same angle in increased elevation while accelerating as a rate I would estimate to be thousands of miles per hour.  Poof!  Gone in a second or less.  I would often describe the angle and acceleration as “impossible”. In conclusion I would like to add that I made a few calls to the weather services, NASA, and other agencies in and around Virginia and Washington, D.C. attempting to find out more or report the incident and ran into a brick wall.  More than once I was told to “just drop it”.  At times I assumed it was some military test flight, but in the twenty years since it happened, nothing like it has been produced by our military so I have begun to rethink it. I would describe myself at the time as a college student attending Virginia Commonwealth University.  The campus is only a few blocks from the location of the sighting.  I was about 23 years old.  Again, I may have the date off by as many as twelve months as I lived on Laurel Street from September of 1988-June 1989.   I studied communications, computer science and philosophy.  I have never before or since experienced anything like what I observed that day when I was walking home from class. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Carolina Beach N.C. cigar I shined my bright headlights on it!Entry Date 7/20/00   As best as i can recall as time frames escape me, in the summer of 1987 as a resident of Carolina Beach,N.C.  my mother began yelling from our back porch that she was seeing a u.f.o..  After ignoring her cries for three times,I was compelled to go check the situation out because of her ""close encounter"" scream! Upon entrance of the back porch facing the ocean ,I then observed a tubular shaped flying vehicle beaming the most spectacular blinding light into the ocean waters not more than 1000 yards away from shore!I turned to Mom and We both began to more or less ""freak-out"" about what We were seeing! I then instructed her to examine every detail about this ""thing"" so that We could better remember it's design. Imagine,if you will,say a 747 jet without any wings or tail,only gigantical and unpainted,the bare metal design showing no rivets whatsoever.Windows adorned the side from front to back and forms of occupants were hazily seen behind some in the mid-section.It made no noise! I! t hovered over the ocean as if looking for something in the shallow surf[speculation].I then left Mom and ran to the car and sped away at at least 80m.p.h. in a 20m.p.h. zone to the Phelps' pier at the end of Carolina Ave. North and slung the car around to face the still oncoming slow sailing airship. This angered local residents who came to confront my recklessness , but once I pointed to that ""thing"" all was astonished at ""it"".As it neared I clicked my bright headlights on it. It then slowly swung around and faced me dead straight! It now looked like a circle and had it's light off. It began to hover over me. At this point I closed my eyes and began to fervently PRAY!! When I looked back up ,it slowly moved back to surf just beyond the pier and ""blasted"" is too slow the term for it's departure! Instantly in the distance Wrightsville Beach N.C. lit up from the u.f.o.'s lightbeam. After a few min. the same thing began at Topsail Beach'N.C. . This happened up the North Carol! ina eastern coastline untill it faded from my sight. When I ! ! returned home my mom said local news would carry the story at 11:00 which was just coming up. In a brief report , they mentioned that the u.f.o. sightings being called in was nothing more than a ""Coast Guard Drug Survailence Vehicle""! O.K. Carolina Beach 'You remember this!! Who could ever forget?! Back me up on this!  UPDATE AND CORRECTIONS TO ORIGINAL POST ABOVE  I wanted to be more precise on this as it was something that was vague in it's post back then. I just wanted to clarify it.It bothers me that so far only the first witness(my mom)has responded and posted about this event. As best as I can recollect,(as the exact time frame escapes me),it was in the summer start in 1987 of mid April. I was a local resident of Carolina Beach, NC. Lying on my back in bed, playing an electric guitar unplugged, I began to hear my mother yelling from our back porch that she was seeing a UFO. After ignoring her three times,I was finally compelled to rise up and go check the situation out because she had just frantically ran up to my locked door and screamed out... ""It's a close encounter of the 3rd kind!"" So with that statement it really got my attention and upon my entrance out the back door onto the porch facing the ocean ,I then observed a very large and long tubular shaped flying vehicle that was beaming the most spectacular blinding light into the ocean waters not more than 1,000 yards away from shore! I turned to Mom and we both began to more or less ""freak-out"" about what we were seeing! I was astonished at it's huge dimensions and how far it spanned down the! coastline to it's right from it's front front. It had large rectangular windows that started from behind the nose section all the way to the rear. I was stunned at the close up encounter of this ship because of it's magnitude and awe commanding presence. I turned and looked at my mom and saw an expression I had never seen on her face and told her ...""You should see the look on your face"" and she replied the same thing back to me! I then instructed her to please examine and to pay close attention to every detail about this ""thing"" so that we could better remember it's design having no camera to capture the image. I told her to remember the details and we were to write them down on paper later that night while all was fresh on our minds. We then began pointing out to each other how this airship has no signs of being assembled and riveted. It was so flawless. No signs on it at all of any wear or rust or scratches etc. We were close enough looking right from the back porch tha! t if I had a rock I could have struck it with ease as there wa! s no way I could have missed the monster sized UFO. Imagine a 747 jet shape without any wings or tail or front windows but only gigantic and unpainted. It rose very high and was very round and blimpish. Bare metal in design and showing no rivets whatsoever. Gigantic rectangular windows adorning the side from front to back (which by the way was easily several football fields long or yet longer in length) and there was this greenish/yellowish blurry light in the center section with forms of occupants that were hazily seen because it seemed to make you unable to focus upon them. It made no noise! It hovered over the ocean as if looking for something in the shallow surf with a blinding beam of light that shot out from it's bottom side. This wide and bright light did not shine outwards but stayed in a curtain like drop from the bottom that lit up the ocean water like the color of a swimming pool looks in lights at night while all surroundings were dark grayish night. It was slowly passin! g by but still right in front of us when I decided to get the car and go down the road towards the end of the island to see it approaching from that view. I left mom by herself on the back porch and grabbed her car keys off a hook on the wall by the front doorway and took her Plymouth Volare without her permission (my car had a weak battery before this)and sped away at at least 80 MPH in the 20 MPH zone to get to the Phelps' pier at the end of Carolina Avenue North. When I got there I slung the  steering wheel a hard right and spun the car around in order to face the still oncoming slow sailing airship that soon would hopefully arrive. This angered some local residents but especially disturbed some tourists who confronted my recklessness from the balconies of some adjacent condos. They began ""telling me off"" and how they had indeed called the police. The police department was less than a mile away and it would just take minutes to get there. I told them...""Good... we're gon! na need them!"" That comment seemed to scare them as if I had j! ust thre atened them. I recall they had a Queens New York styled or New Jersey type accent/dialect. One particular man in that group asked me why was I acting so strange and what was I trying to accomplish by my odd reckless behavior. I had gotten the car stuck in the sand and had it in a weird position and I now was just standing outside the driver's side door with my leg inside ready to click the high beams on. I replied...""You'll see""! He thought I was crazy and my answers were a threat. But I was so focused on trying to locate that UFO thing that nothing bothered me. It was a grayish dark night. The UFO had turned off it's lights and I could not see it. I walked out to the surf and looked right down the shoreline and it was nowhere to be seen. I was standing there thinking I was about to be arrested or took away to be evaluated when it dawned on me I was looking right at it! From the direct front it was a large circle! It blended in with the sky but was coming onward straight ahe! ad like I hoped it was. I ran to the car and positioned my foot above the high beam switch on the floorboard. That man continued asking me why I doing the things I was and that cops would be here any minute and I knew if I said anything about a UFO that it would only go from bad to worse so I just pointed at the area where it soon would appear and said ...""Just keep lookin' right there fellow!"" As it neared I clicked the bright headlights on it. Two small headlight dots appeared upon the giant blimp like structure. They all saw it and began to go insanely frightened and saying all kinds of stuff and it caused me to smirk when they began asking me what it was etc.(As if I knew!)It then slowly swung around and faced me dead straight! It now looked like that circle. It began to hover right over me.I knew I had made this event happen by not minding my own business and it was now hovering at me. At this point I closed my eyes and began to fervently pray!I was so scared that I sm! ashed my face into the sand and was screaming out to God to sa! ve me. I think I repented for things I never did but feared I was perhaps about to die by maybe that light that can come from it's underside. That man that talked to/at me earlier was saying...""You can come up from there...it's leaving! It's backing up man!"" But I was too frightened to believe him but he kept insisting it was cool to look up. So when I looked up it was slowly moving backwards just beyond the pier and then it turned so precise and they all saw its huge cigar shape just long enough to get a good mental picture and in just a split second it ""blasted"" (too slow of a term)away! More screams and explicatives came from the condo balconies and I pointed to the horizon to the left where the night lights of Wrightsville Beach NC were twinkling from and then instantly there in the distance, Wrightsville Beach NC lit up from that UFO's light beam. After a few minutes the same thing began to repeat itself at Topsail Beach etc. This happened up the North Carolina eastern coastlin! e until it faded like ""heat lightning"" from our sight. Those people who were angered at me...well they helped me get out of the sand and I went back home never once encountering an officer of the law kind! When I returned home my mom gave me an earful for leaving her alone and taking her car but then said that the local news was going to carry the story at 11:00 PM which was just coming up. In a brief report by a girl who's first name was Michelle, they mentioned that the UFO sightings being called in was nothing more than a ""Coast Guard Drug Surveillance Vehicle"" ! (I later asked the local news station for a copy of that broadcast and they told me that they don't archive news broadcasts). My mom and I both that very night had drawn our pictures of the craft and wrote out our affidavits about our encounter and put them in a separate file among the important paperworks stored in a special closet. Later that year we had to move and that particular paperwork was all we found missing! Many years went by and I've told this event to hundreds of listeners. I once told a retired Air Force officer and he cussed me out and told me that I had better keep my @#$%% mouth shut if I knew what was good for me. He continued cussing me out until I was red faced and hot under the collar and he drove off down the wrong side of the highway pulled over at a nearby phone booth and made a phone call. My wife was disturbed and asked me to quit telling others. Later that night when we got home, we found someone had entered our home with no sign of breaking in. We never found anything out of place except that someone had entered the house and installed a new cartridge of ink in our printer and used over half of it. It's like they wanted us to know it. The strangest part of my encounter is that it was not late and had not been dark very long when I laid back to play my guitar. But when I returned home it was almost eleven o' clock. I was not abducted. I did not recall anything longer than perhaps thirty minutes time taking place. That missing time thing has bothered me. And those people on the balconies may have took photos. They had a lot of time to do that. And the police never showed up. And the TV station constantly shows archived footages of old news. If I'm sounding somewhat paranoid then it's only because I have what I consider to be good valid reasons. And to make it even weirder is that in the very same location where the UFO was first encountered, me and my brother-in-law both watched the figure of a person come out of the surf there one night in what seemed like gray flannel attire compete with a hood that covered the head and although it should have been dripping wet it's attire was completely dry and flapping in the wind and then it just vaporized in front of us! For readers this is the 800 block of Carolina Avenue North. OK Carolina Beach people in April of '87... you remember this!! Who could ever forget?! Back me up on this!

I walked out into the yard to get a better look at it. I could immediately tell it wasn't an airplane. It lacked the usual appearance of the commercial airline planes I see periodically; tail, wings, exhaust stream, markings of any kind, windows. It was a gleaming white yet translucent. Each end was ""rounded"" and the center was a different shade which made it look like it had a ""band"" around it. There was absolutely no sound coming from this craft.  The weather was calm; no wind, blue skies, and a bright morning sun in the east. Since I had been uploading vacation photos from my camera into my laptop that was on the kitchen table, I had my camera in an accessible location. I ran into the house and grabbed the camera which took less than 10 seconds. Upon returning to the back yard, it was evident that this object was moving faster than any commercial airliner. I decided to put my camera on ""consecutive"" shooting but the craft was moving so fast and had changed it's course from a straight North to South path to an ascending southerly path and was gaining altitude with such speed that I was losing visual in a matter of seconds.  It went from a size where it would have taken a nickel to cover the entire craft to a pinpoint. I was only able to catch one pretty clear photo.

Having a great view of the bridge from the roof of the building we were in, we went upstairs to watch. We first saw one bright orb-shaped light floating in the sky fairly low, maybe 100-200 feet above the skyline. It was not moving, so we weren't sure if it was actually floating or a light on top of a building.  As we watched, we started to notice small, bizarre reflections in the sky around it, tiny points of shimmering light (more like reflections of light then actual light itself) slowly moving around the sky, becoming more and less visible. Once, one of these reflection points hovered slowly before shooting off at an extreme velocity straight into the sky. After seeing this, we we're frightened and excited, and ran to get a video camera to film the events that followed. The video of the following events can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQzn0zFG6fk (note that youtube compression makes this much less dramatic, please contact me personally if you desire a higher resolution version of the video)  After we set the camera pointing at the still brightly glowing, low, non-moving light in the sky, we noticed that directly above the light two smaller lights came on, both moving fluidly but unnaturally above the initial light. They seemed to have emerged from the initial light. At first these were smaller, and they appeared approximating an upside-down triangle with the initial light at the base. All three then became equal in brightness for about half a minute. The two upper lights slowly switched positions, as the light at the bottom (which had been on for considerably longer) began to descend, very slowly. It descended completely below the skyline over the course of about 3 minutes, with the upper lights moving to approximate a vertical line. Then, the upper lights, each now as bright as the next, began to also descend, until all three had disappeared behind the skyline.

On the night of July 18, 2010 at around 10:00 pm in Chico, Ca, while walking home from the store, I witnessed what I thought at first was an airplane.  Upon looking at it closer I noticed that the light formation on it was different than the airplanes that I’m so used to seeing. What caught my attention was that it was moving abnormally slow for an airplane, but on par with maybe a helicopter or blimp.  For a minute, I thought it could be an ultra light aircraft, but it was completely silent.  Next I thought maybe the lights on the bottom of a blimp, but I have never witnessed a blimp in 15 years of living here.  My best guess was that it was triangle shaped, but it was very hard to make out with city lights around.  This thing whatever it was made absolutely no noise.  It kept slowing down and finally stopped and sat there for about 10 seconds before changing course.  It was initially heading west but stopped and changed course to heading due north.  When it changed direction it went straight over head.  As it flew over I tried to make out what it was.  It had three white lights in a triangle formation with one blinking red light in the middle with one additional slightly dimmer blinking white light mixed in.   The red light was slightly brighter than the rest of the lights.  It didn’t seem to be very far up at all, and it wasn’t very big that I could tell.  Before it changed course, it was sort of near the moon I could make out sort of a roundish looking bottom to it, but only for a second.  As it moved northward, it picked up speed to what would be expected of an airplane.  I ran into the house to get my video camera, but when I came out it was way far off. I am quite used to planes flying over and see them often.  I don’t however EVER see a plane slow down, stop, and then completely change course.   It was very eerie watching that fly overhead with no noise at all!   The blinking red light seemed to indicate that it was manmade, but who knows?   Whatever it was it gave me the creeps!   I’m a student here, and have good eyesight and wasn’t at all drunk or anything.   This was not the first weird thing I’ve seen here either.  On Dec, 23 and 24 of 2009, I saw a ball of light out in the distance that looked like the spot light on the front of a helicopter, but got dimmer and after it travelled some distance faded into nothing.  I saw this twice in two days!   I followed the second one for a block or so on foot just watching before it finally blinked out.  I highly doubt it was ""Chinese lanterns"" as some might say.  These were not flickering, and they were Venus bright at times and silent. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As I watched, it was obvious that the moon was illuminating whatever it was -- (like a gas or some type of energy?) and not headlights from a plane or jet plumage.  As I continued to investigate, it slowly -- and at a deliberate and even pace - traversed east across the moon. I got the sense I was witnessing something quite unique and even though it sounds mundane as I type this, it was truly awesome as it stretched as far north and south as the eye could see.  It was geometrically perfect, narrowing at both ends.  If I had to guess at what it might be, I could only say that I believe it was a deliberate mass of something that had a specific purpose. As it arrived close to the moon and was about to cross it, I could determine it was approximately twice as wide as the moon, and as it traveled east and away from the moon, it got dimmer until I could no longer make out the outline.

The object seemed to get bigger, though this might have been an effect of the increasing luminosity, changing from an off-w! hite color to more of a resplendent white. This lasted about 5 seconds, after which the light dimmed, making the object seem as if it were getting smaller. As it dimmed it became blue, like so many stars.  What was left, for a moment, was a dim dot of light surrounded by an even fainter corona; it resembled the dot of light that would be left in the center of the screen on old black-and-white televisions immediately after being turned off.  This lasted for just a moment, after which the dot became smaller and dimmer, until disappearing altogether.

It got bigger and extremely bright, with bright lights swirling around inside it, as it approached us over a hill.  All of a sudden there was a triangular craft, huge, hovering over our vehicle.  It was very black, and the stars were out in force so you could see the outline of its blackness against the stars.  It had a phosphorescent greenish light on the bottom that pulsated in varying degrees of intensity within some sort of tubular triangle.  This area was much smaller than the craft itself and appeared to be an energy source.  There were very large pine trees right below it and to the side of our car and the craft was right above the trees, very large and just so black.  At some point we had rolled down our windows and were amazed to hear NO NOISE AT ALL..but you ! could FEEL an electrical current of some sort, almost static feeling, almost a humming felt in your body.  We could not stop looking at this unbelievable craft, it was above our car in the middle of NOWHERE in the countryside.  When our dog-a Boxer-started growling very uncharacteristically loud with fur standing up on her back, we became afraid and took off slowly so as not to disturb the craft. The craft immediately shot straight up into the sky in a white light, with many small white orbs circling it, and then at high altitude it shot horizontally at high speed followed by orbs and vanished.   We went home and drew it several times for my parents.  We were in college and just could not even believe what we had seen.  We are educated and believe in God.

(Refer to the corners of a ""triforce"" to better grasp this concept.) It appeared that all the lights were connected to the same craft, as opposed to the lights being their each individual entities, because as the object moved through the sky, the lights remained equidistant to each other. he rest of the craft, aside from the lights, was a dense dark shade of black. The only way it was possible to make out the shape of the craft, was seeing how it blocked out the stars as it passed through the sky. Besides that, the craft was relatively invisible in contrast with the black sky. It flew through the area quite low, such as if you were in the proximity of an airport with the planes flying over you to land. The biggest shock of all, when comparing this object to a low flying aircraft, was the absolute absence of any and all noise. No engine noise, no sonic boom. The craft moved in pure silence. The object passed through the sky heading heading Westbound. We first saw the object in the horizon of the Eastern sky, towards Yorba Linda.  We watched it come straight towards us, and just as it had nearly reached our location, it began to alter it's course. It bent to it's ride side and headed North-West towards Fullerton.

I was standing there and noticed a craft appear near Port Columbus International Airport. I thought it was a plane taking off from its location due to the low altitude of the craft. I thought nothing of it and just put it off. I then watched the craft make a complete circle around the perimeter of my location, and thought it was flying awfully low among the tree lines. As the craft approached my location I moved up the driveway to catch a better glimps. As the craft moves overhead I was directly underneith and could see the shape of a triangle with white lights at each point and a blinking red light in the middle of the craft.

On November 28th at about 630pm I was driving in the left lane of i75 northbound between Troy and Bloomfield Hills, Mi. The sky was heavily overcast and dark. The heavy clouds were semi-illuminated by the plentiful sub-urban lighting in the area. The freeway was quite busy in both directions. I was approaching the ""Adams"" Rd. exit when I noticed an odd pair of white lights above the trees to the east of the freeway. At the moment these lights looked rather like car headlights, if these could be in the air. At first I thought they might be lights atop a new communications tower or something. Over the next 45 seconds I closed in on the lights, and it became clear that they were certainly unusual. As I neared I realized that these lights were not from a tower, and i thought that a small plane might be flying quite low. However, it quickly became apparent that the object was hovering in the air without moving. Further, it lacked typical beacon or strobe lights found on aircraft. I quickly glanced around and noticed that I was somehow the only person that was noticing this object.. despite the fact that it was hovering in plain sight only slightly to the right of the freeway and about 50 feet above the near trees. It was extremely apparent. At this time I quickly moved to the slow lane and off onto the right shoulder, placing myself almost under the object. As I looked up to it, I saw the shape clearly against the dim sky. It was an obtuse triangle with a somewhat bright white light at each point. The ""wide"" point of the triangle was pointed north, in the direction I was headed. The two other points of the triangle pointed east and west. The craft had a non-reflective black surface that demonstrated no surface details or reflections. The edges of the craft were clearly defined against the cloud cover. Unfortunately, I had no camera with me. I did have binoculars but in the moment I did not think to use them. I began to move out onto the freeway, continuing north. As i pulled out i looked out at the craft, it seemed to have turned as I could now only see two lights. It was still in the same location. I looked forward and accelerated. Just them a bright ""flash"" of light shone through the glass of my sunroof, moving east to west over me. I looked out my driver-side window in the apparent direction of the light and saw nothing moving. However, through the clouds to the near-west, I then saw a series of four quick ""flashes"" of light, like narrow pulses from above the cloud. These flashes were white in color. I quickly turned to look where the craft was and it was now gone. I continued onward to my destination. I saw no more of this craft for the rest of my trip. However, I did see a second ""object"" later in the evening, while driving south on my return trip to Detroit. This object seemed quite different, and I will write a sister report for this one. It was seen in Goodrich, MI. and will be reported from that city, on the same date. It astonishes me, however, that while never seeing such a thing my entire life I now see two ""UFOs"" in the same evening. In addition, my sister has described to me two similar sightings in the past several weeks. These were seen in the same general region. I am presently a student of psychology, working toward a PhD. I possess degrees in photography and liberal arts. I have excellent eyesight and was not using drugs or alcohol.

I had come home from Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota, to enjoy a couple of weeks at home in Georgia.  One evening, my brother, my girlfriend, and I decided to go fishing for catfish at a local pay lake in Henry County.  We started fishing around 9:00 PM that evening.  We hadn’t had much luck. We only caught a couple of small cats about twelve inches or so.  My brother had been fishing there before, and he told us that the fishing usually started picking up around midnight.  My girlfriend, who was also in Air Force at the time, was ready to go.  However, my brother and I talked her into sticking it out with us. That night, the moon was bright enough so that we could see the top of the tree line against the sky just beyond the damn of the lake.  The night sky was littered with patches of clouds all around. Sometime after midnight, we all saw this object in the sky.  We were looking in the direction of the damn which was to our right.  I believe the damn was to the North of our location.  I can’t be sure, as I had never been to the lake before.  The object was a reddish orange oval shape that had some sort of a tail or exhaust in the same color as the object itself.  It wasn’t like any light that I had ever seen before or since.  It didn’t have a constant solid light color as most lights do.  Instead, it seemed to be more like a ball of lava.  I don’t want to say that it was like a ball of fire, because it had a cooler appearance, almost like the stuff in a lava lamp.  The object was at a lower altitude than the clouds. It did not make a sound at all as it moved through the sky.  We watched it! for approximately 10 to 15 seconds as it continued its straight path through the night sky.  The tail maintained the same distance from the body of the object the entire time.  We finally lost sight of it to the farthest right part of the sky. I have seen all types of aircraft flying at night during my time in the Air Force.  I was in Desert Storm, and I was an aircraft armament systems specialist. My duties were on the flight line.  I have seen shooting stars and meteors before.  I also know what a comet looks like, and they aren’t within our atmosphere the way this thing was.  This was something that none of us had ever seen before.  My brother and I were talking about it just the other day, and I finally decided to tell someone to see if they had an answer.

There was no sound coming from the object either.  It was a moonlit night and the object though metallic in appearance didn't reflect the light it seemed to be what I would describe as a brush aluminum finish.

I will not even say what craft he flown for fear of narrowing down his chances of being picked out.   The information is that a craft of around a mile in diameter appeared off the coastline of San Diego at night above the cloud layer.  It has multiple antennas dotting across its surface all around it.  It had bulbous mirror like windows spaced out evenly around the entire spacecraft.  Each bulb emitted randomized color effects at a normal pulse of probally 1 per second randomly on any given bulb.   When the pilots were tasked to go out to investigate the anomalous object.  There were already multiple fighter jets on station.  They flew around it for over a hour at the minimum taking pictures and video.  At some point it started pulsating rapidly then completely disappeared.   Winked out that is.   One of those pilots is a high ranking officer and one of those pilots from what I am told was a Nasa director.  This story was told in confidence because a life was saved and felt the need to relieve this information to someone other than themselves.   Collabration between the nasa director and the other pilot upon telling the story were both agreed upon.

Summer of 2000, no exact date recalled.  We were a small crew of contract Audio/video design/installers working at the new Brownsville Federal Courthouse.  The crew consisted of Northern Alabama, Southern West Virginia working class, slightly technical males.  I was a degreed, technically savvy programmer in charge of the crew.  I have had a lifelong interest in UFO’s but remain a skeptic of extraterrestrial explanations.   We were staying at a beachfront hotel on South Padre Island.   While having cocktails on the surf-side deck after sundown I was showing the guys how to spot orbiting satellites.  The night was clear and still.  Satellites were easy to spot as the night was young.  They were surprised it could be done with the naked eye.   Shortly one of the guys asked me if what he had spotted was a satellite.  What he had spotted was an amber light in the shape of an oval (lozenge) flying from the gulf toward land.  We were sitting facing the Gulf almost due east. I first saw it about 30° to my left (facing east) and 40° from water horizon.  The light was so clear and present I first thought it may be a streetlight reflecting off of the breast of a seagull.  The direction appeared to be slightly northwest in a straight trajectory.   As the object continued it was temporarily out of sight by other hotels as it crossed over the coastline.  The distance then seemed more apparent.  It was at least many miles away with no trail or sound or sonic boom.  The bright amber color was uniform and constant.  While the altitude seemed no more than 35° from horizon from our standpoint, it could have been at any altitude depending on the distance from us.  What makes this exceptional in my opinion is the fact that it crossed 45° of my visual in about 8 seconds at a minimum of 5 or more miles distance. It came in and was first spotted out over the Gulf of Mexico, had passed to the left of us and continued on to the back of us in 8 seconds.  Later looking at a national map and just estimating locations and observed directions, it seemed to be on a path that would have passed over Del Rio, TX.  And if continued, on toward Southern California. I guestimated the speed to be from 5,000 to 15,000 miles per hour depending on estimated distances and altitudes combined with the 8 second time interval and the 90° beginning and end of the sighting.

The drawing of that sighting is the only thing I have ever seen even remotely resembling what I witnessed. I want to ask did the caller specify the shape as it is drawn? Mine appeared to be circular although I believe it rotated. Did I report only 10 minutes for that sighting? As I remember it, there would have had to be approximately 40 minutes driving time for that stretch and a bit more for the time I was stopped. Sorry, if it was my reporting error. I am still looking for an explanation for this event.  I did not want it in my report at the time, but I will add here, “off the record,” that I was in contact with a NASA Russian Spacecraft Specialist at the time.  I sold real estate and he wanted a place to retire when he came back from Russia. After I couldn’t find anything on the news, and the thing didn’t show up in my pictures (digital and not a bit distorted anywhere, no pun) I contacted my NASA friend and told him about and said it was only a UFO until he told me what I saw.  He checked thoroughly and came back with “It isn’t ours.”  Well, what else could he have said.  It seemed curious at the time, but less so now, that he totally believed me, even the no show in the pictures. The next day there were three black low flying planes over the area.  Had they asked me, I could have told them they wouldn’t find anything.  There was an “earthquake” the night before that rattled stuff on the shelves. I assumed what didn’t burn was blowing up.  I checked earthquake activity the next morning.  The closest was a 2 some 200 miles away. This thing was so big! And at one point while it was stopped and I drove to within maybe a hundred and fifty feet of it (big guess) it must have been 80’ long, with a width of 50’ across the top and 30’ at the bottom. I don’t want this posted, but I would like to know about that other sighting I mentioned up top.  And if you have anything similar in your files, please. Thank you",2011-05-02T00:00:00,,

When I looked up I saw a dark gray triangular shape above me (the only light was the one on the front of the triangle) it would have been about 30 foot in size point to point, and passed over my house at about three times the height of my house.  It was TOTALLY SILENT, and moving slowly in a north to south direction.

A hatch opened up moments later, and a Man with yellow wavy hair and gray eyes came out and told me “Do not to be afraid.” I then looked at my dog Boe for a reaction that maybe I should be afraid, however Boe was as calm as could be, so I replied “I am not afraid.” He then told me many things  Eph. 2V2 Satan is the Prince of Power of the Air (Atmosphere), (spell) 1st Heaven Surrounds the Earth 2nd Heaven Night Sky (Universe) 	                                                  3rd Heaven God's Throne  	Satan is a Supernatural being angel or demon if you will he is also a Rebel.

Two Silver Disks observed in broad daylight.,Haverhill,MA,,disk,5 minutes,"Occurred : 8/16/1962 12:00  (Entered as : 08/16/62 12:00) Reported: 1/25/2011 6:32:00 PM 18:32 Posted: 1/31/2011 Location: Haverhill, MA Shape: Disk Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79831.html,"Two Silver Disks observed in broad daylight. The following event took place nearly 49 years ago.  I was nine years old at the time of the event.  It happened in mid Summer, and in broad daylight.  There were two witnesses to the sighting, myself, and a friend that I will refer to as Willy. At the time, I lived very near one of the largest hills in Haverhill, Mass.  We called the hill, Tilton's Tower, because at one time there had stood a large, brick viewing tower atop the hill.  The tower was long gone by 1962, and in its place was a large (200 ft. +/-) radio transmission tower, which was used to broadcast our local AM radio station.  If it was used for anything else, I know not.  The entire hill was otherwise devoid of any houses or buildings.  It was a great place for us neighborhood kids to play and explore. On a bright sunny August day, my friend Willy and me decided to hike up to the top of the hill.  We had made our own bows and arrows, by bending a branch for a bow, and using the straightest sticks we could find, as arrows.  ""Come on, let's go to the top of Tilton's Tower,"" I said, ""Maybe we can shoot a rabbit."" Willy and I climbed to the top where the grass was nearly waist high.  We walked through the tall grass hoping to flush out a rabbit, but alas, the only thing jumping were grasshoppers. So that we might make some use of our bows and arrows, I got the idea that we could shoot our arrows straight up into the sky, and see whose arrow would go the farthest. ""Okay!"", said Willy, ""I'll bet mine'll go higher than yours!""  We both drew back on our bows and pointing our arrows straight up. ""Reday"", I said, ""Aim... Fire!""  ""They went about the same height"", Willy said. ""Okay, let's try it again"", I said.  So, again we pulled back as hard as we could on our bow strings, pointed our arrows up toward the sky and.... ""Hey!"" I yelled, ""What's that?"" I lowered my bow, but kept my gaze straight up, for there in bright blue sky, was a silvery, shiny disk darting this way and that. ""Hey! Do you see that?"" ""Yes"", Willie replied. The disk was bright silver, perfectly round, and moving in a zig zag pattern, that gave me the impression of the movement of a gyroscope.  It tipped slightly, banked, moved forward and side to side. The sun was nearly directly overhead, and it almost seemed to playing tag with the sun.  We stood and watched it for a minute or two.  The size was about what a dime would be at arms length. ""What is it?"", I said. ""I don't know... a Flying Saucer."", said Willie.  Suddenly, the first one was joined by a second. ""Hey look!   Now there's two of them!!"" I shouted.  The two disks moved close to one another at the same altitude.  While their movements were quite erratic, and while they crossed paths with each other, they didn't collide.  They both remained pretty much overhead during the entire sighting period.  Then... in an instant... they were gone!   ""There gone!"" said Willy. ""Yeah, where did they go?"", I asked.  We scanned the sky, but the two disks were no where to be seen. Needless to say, we hurriedly made our way down the hill.  I've never forgotten that day. There is no doubt in my mind that the two disks that we both saw were real.  Beyond a doubt, these were solid, controlled, flying objects, and could not have been anything else.  I consider myself very fortunate to have had this experience.

I was shocked when I realized that the object must have been miles away yet I was hearing it as it flickered and the intensity of the sound followed the flickering exactly.   Later, I discovered that this is a documented phenomenon that is reportedly caused by a electromagnetic coupling of the em given off by the meteor with the observers hearing system without any perceptible sound being transferred from the meteor to the observers ear,  I beleive it is refered to as ""ElectroPhonic Meteor"" effect. see: http://www.meteorobs.org/bagnall/audible.htm ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There was no noise coming from it and I saw the tall grass directly under it was moving,but not off beyond the craft.

I have viewed it from several different vantage points, both with the naked eye and with binoculars, a well as taken pictures.  Anybody who looks up at the sky could clearly see it. It is not being shy or covert at all.  It doesn’t seem to move much except to make a very slow descent behind the big mountain that makes up one half of the Camarillo grade (101 freeway, where truck scales are), so by 11:30 or so, it ha disappeared from my view. It does appear to change colors occasionally, from brilliant white, to a hazy yellowish orange, to a bluish white glow, and sometimes a red aura appears on the top part of whatever this is. It also appeared to have some much smaller, much dimmer lights come off it in several instances over the past week.  Because there is a military base nearby ( Point Mugu) I at first thought it was some kind of helicopter holding its position in a military exercise of some kind. And it might be just that, I don’t know what it is at this point. I wouldn’t have even come here to post this, except for a caller I heard on the Coast to Coast  radio show that described how he was seeing a strange bright light in the sky from sundown to 11:30pm, and this had been every evening for the last week or so. He went on to describe the very same characteristics that the light I was seeing possessed.  The show host told this caller to report his sighting on this website. So I figured I should do the same with my sighting, for whatever its worth. I unfortunately did not hear where the caller was calling from, but would like to find out if it’s the same light or two different ones in two separate places. I guess I will just continue to watch it at night, and to try to get some better pictures of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus in the western sky, we suspect.

We are located at the outer limits of approach aircraft. The object appeared as a bright reflective object, located N30E, approximately 30 to 35 degrees above the horizon.

I was sitting at a table between two modular homes. I was facing approximately, North, North-East.  At the time of the siting, I looked up about 45 degrees and saw a light in the sky.  Then there was a second light to the left of the first one. I first thought there these were early stars, but the sky was still quite blue, the star Antaries, which usually came out first, directly above, was not out yet. My first thought was that I was seeing an aircraft, or a satellite, or a space station.  I commented to my friend about seeing two lights.  Then the one to the left started to move to the left.  As it did, two other lights appeared about these first two.  They were closer together than the firs two.  Then the second light that moved to the left disappeared.  Thie direction would be toward the North West. Now there was just the three.  Then the upper two lights disappeared followed by the first light. I was puzzled because, these lights really looked like faint stars, but it was too early for stars to appear. The final formation of these four points of light could be labeled like the geometric figure known as a trapezoid.  The lower left point of light was the one that moved away. I tried to see if the other three moved in any direction. They did not. They only disappeared. Thirty minutes later when the Great Dipper came out I tried to get my bearings to determine which part of the sky these lights appeared. This was approximately above the constellation of Cassiopeia.  But not as high as the North Star. This siting was so unusual that I got up from the dinner table and started mentioning to my friend that there were some lights in the sky and that one was moving. It was shortly after standing up that the other two higher lights appeared and then disappeared. My friend also got up from the table.  I pointed to the area of the sky where I was seeing the lights.  I asked him if he saw the lights, but he said he did not see any lights. Usually I wear contact lenses in both eyes.  For over a month I have not worn a contact lens in my left eye, in order to prepare for an eye test, prior to cataract surgery.  I was only wearing one contact lens in my right eye.   My vision in my right eye, with corrective lens is better than normal.  It is between 20/50 and 20/70.   I am very certain that I say what I saw.

However when I checked back to it several minutes later the clouds have passed & I noticed that even a clear sky the object emitted still was glowing a diffused white light. It did not appear to be solid & I could not gauge a distance.  The other interesting thing was that it did not move at all in that time & when looking at it with peripheral vision - it seemed to flicker quite rapidly.  However one was unable to see the flickering when looking at it directly.  The flickering was somewhat random, & very rapid, not like a star. During the next roughly 3 hours as we! continued to observe the object, It continued to remain in the exact same location, flicker quite vibrantly & every few minutes it would seem to dissipate for a minute or so, only to return to the same location.  The flickering was quite prominent at times, to the point that it seemed to light up the sky quite visibly in the peripheral vision when not paying too much attention. At roughly 12:30 the object disappeared again but did not return this time. It remained stationary the whole 3 hours when looking south east @ roughly 30-40 degrees inclination.

The other report is listed for this same date in the city of Troy, MI. Despite being the same date, this is an entirely different siting, occurring just a matter of hours later. Just before 11:30pm I was traveling southbound on M15 between the towns of Goodrich and Ortonville. This area is lightly populated with farms and wooded lots covering most of the land. There is not a lot of ambient light in the area, and the sky can often be seen quite clearly. The weather was quite overcast at the time and a solid cloud ceiling was sitting relatively low in the atmosphere. I was traveling around 45mph and  crested a low hill. As I did so a small community (sub-division) of houses came up on the right. From the road one could see out to the west, over the tops of the houses to the tree line beyond them. This tree line was approximately 1/4 mile away from where I was driving. Just as the sub-division approached on my right, I glanced out to the west, over the afore-mentioned tree line. It was then that I noticed the second odd object of this evening. I saw what then appeared to be a pair of small strobe lights, much like the type that one could purchase in a toy store for home use. These lights were flying very low above the tree line, in the same direction i was going. The ""craft"" was moving in a very swift and almost fluttering manner. These lights looked quite small, and seemed to be just inches apart. These strobe lights were pulsing very fast, as if the home type of strobe light were turned all of the way up. Instead of being white, these lights had a blue cast. At no point did i hear any noise from the object. I immediately turned into the sub-division and sped to the back of the houses. I reached the back of the sub-division and grabbed my binoculars. I then jumped from my vehicle and ran to the back yard of a home. These actions took a matter of seconds. From this backyard a huge swamp-valley stretched away for miles, visibility was uninterrupted. To my surprise the light was now an incredible distance away, much further than any plane would be. It was still very low, below the clouds. I was able to ascertain that the object had actually stopped moving. It was stopped below the clouds, hovering in the glow of a distant city. From what I could tell, the craft was just sitting over the center of a far off small town. I later determined this city to be Clarkston, several miles away. I looked through my binoculars and focused on the object. Through the binoculars the light actually looked like a single thin, long light, like a bar of light. It was clearly quite blue and still strobing very quickly. I could not see any detail of the craft to which this light source was connected. After about two minutes I saw the object move away, continuing on it's original southerly course. It vanished over the horizon. On this evening I was witness to two somewhat dramatic sightings only hours apart. I cannot determine if they are related, though they were in relatively close proximity to each other. As stated in the other report, I am a student holding multiple degrees. Before this night I have not seen anything I could classify as a ""UFO"". I am quite sane and not influenced by drugs or alcohol.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,42.9208,-83.4795

Then when I laid down to go back to sleep I was staring at the night sky. I saw what really shocked me! A flying light ball going straight across my neighbors yard into mine very very low and very fast. I saw this very same thing last year but the ball was bigger and orange in color and had fire behind it and was too low to be a comet and changed direction as well. This time it was a very small white light ball and had a white jet stream following it. It was a tiny ball of light very very bright and it appeared out of no where right after an airplane took off on the north runway. I was facing South West towards LAX. The small light ball was flying north right across my yard just above the high line wires just like the one last year. TOO LOW FOR A FALLING STAR! The sky was very clear and the whole thing was only a few seconds maybe o! nly 2 or 3. Too fast to film. I am now very concerned because I woke up this morning and there were so many Chemtrails! On November 13th I also saw in the middle of the day a huge aircraft like an aircraft carrier with 6 silver disks flying in formation like a convoy. I got a picture of the plane but the disks did not show up. Something very strange is going on here over by LAX. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I pulled off the highway and got out of my car to look at it without taking my eyes off the cars in front of me while driving. I was hoping other witnesses would soon join me as I continued to look up at this huge object in the sky, but cars just continued to speed by, apparently nobody else noticing what I was seeing or curious about why I was looking up at the sky. It was just after sunset, dark and yet clearly visible because it was so close and almost directly above me, lit by the city lights and the three round lights, where I pulled over and got out of my car.  I could hear no sound made by the object over the slight sound of many cars rushing past so close by to me. It continues to hover silently over me without moving, without blinking, without changing anything the entire time I observed it. After about maybe fifteen minutes of staring up at it, I gave up hoping someone else would witness it with me. I regretted not having my cell phone with me or I would have called police to see it. I didn't dare try to catch anyone's attention from the passing cars, fearful of causing an accident at those speeds if I tried to wave somebody down.  So I got in my car and went home, watching the news later for any mention of anyone else seeing a UFO like what I’d seen, but heard nothing so I never reported it.  I decided since it was so easy to see because of its size and location and so much traffic and so large a population directly underneath it in downtown Salt Lake City, I decided it must be something from our military since I didn’t see any military craft at all in the area, which is also by the way so close to the Salt Lake City airport that it must have shown on their radar so that’s why I assumed the airport radar people and local air force radar in Layton weren’t paying any attention to it, so that's why I decided nobody else was thinking it was extraterrestrial. However, it so happened that within the next year I happened to go out on one date with several men I met through internet dating sites who happened to work with top secret NASA or air force projects locally through a company called ATK (used to be Morton Thiokol) and another guy worked at area 51 before retiring whom I dated a few times, who gave me a copy of a video that shows him with a top secret aircraft before it became declassified (so I believe he knows top secret aircraft).  I told him about what I had seen and one other guy too, but they told me that our military has nothing like what I saw, ""nothing that big that can hover silently"". The one who worked at area 51 who is himself a pilot with his own airplane told me I might have seen something  called Aurora.  ""Sounds like you saw the Aurora but that is still classified.""   However, I have in the last day gone online and viewed photos of hundreds of triangular shaped crafts and the photos of so-called Aurora and I have seen nothing that looks like what I saw, except for other triangular-shaped craft with a round light in each corner, but none of those look like what I saw.  What I saw, I’m also sure is NOT the TR-3B because the top of what I saw is so very different from all internet photos of the TR-3B I've browsed.  I don’t recall any light in the center of ""my"" triangle either.  I also don't remember ""my"" triangle having rounded corners, but sharper corners from the TR-3B images online and it was more equilateral triangle than the Aurora photos online, much less aerodynamically stream-lined on top than Aurora photos. I am embarrassed to say that I never wrote down the date of this incident, thinking I would never forget it, but unfortunately I have forgotten even the year of this sighting.  To fill out this form, I was required to estimate and exact date but I do not know at all the date within a period of a few years nor even the exact season or time except that it was well dark and it was warm enough outside that I don’t recall feeling cold while I watched outside my car, and I remember clear roads all the way on my drive home from visiting friends in Ogden that evening, coming into Salt Lake City just as night was falling.  I cannot believe that no one else saw it because it was so huge and there hovering in one place for so long in great clear weather!  So that's why I'm trying to find out if anyone else saw it that night, to help me figure out what the exact date was.  I’m certain that the date of my sighting was after Spring of 2004 because I know I was divorced when I saw it.  I know I saw it at least three years ago.  That’s all I can say for sure.  I’m also pretty certain that I did not ""lose any time related to this sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I live in a village (approx. 2000 residents) 25 km from Budapest.  It was a winter evening (2008 or 2009) around 6 to 7 pm (fully dark). It was overcast with cloud base at approx 100 m (300 ft). I drove home from work, parked my car in the garage and went up the (outside) stairs to enter my house.  After a few steps on the stairs I could see over the garage and noticed a strange thing. Dim blueish green light sources on a circular pattern, about 10 pcs, rotating slowly around the center, about half rotation per sec.  It seemed as they were on the bottom of a circular object, which is spinning horizontally.  I could not see the object itself, so unsure about its shape, because there was not any backlight.  I could just see the lights on its bottom.  It was about 300 m away from me and with the little reference to other objects (some tall trees) I estimate its diameter to be 15 m, and its altitude 50 m over the land.  There is a main railway line at the edge of the village and it seemed a bit farther than that, over the lands. It was hovering, no movement and the rotation was also stable.  The lights were also stable in color and brightness.  First I thought someone was playing with kind of a disco laser light, which would probably project similarly on a very smooth cloud base.  But after about 5 seconds it started to move left (East) in a way what was very surprising to me and excluded the disco light possibility.  First it tipped left about 20 to 30 deg and started to move in that direction.  Then it tipped right the same amount, and continued this slow left-right tipping, while moving slowly to East (50 kmh?), and out of my sight (other buildings, trees and terrain blocking sight). I told my wife what I just saw and to my workmates next day.   I am an electrical engineer and have a PPL and tried to identify the object based on my knowledge, but I still cannot explain it.

I fell face first on to my bed...I had just finished a shower and had a lavender towel wrapped around me....the dogs were with me........ I found myself flat on the bed face down.

I was not me...it was inside me and it controlled my thoughts...it wanted me in a fearful state.

I am not afraid.  I am not going to let this event reck my life.  I am not alone in this situation.  Why won't the United States Government, CIA, FBI-come clean on this?   What is the long term agenda?  The hardest part in all of this is family members think you need a straight jacket.  There's no way to prove what I went through.  I have talked with the ""shrinks"" on the high demand of my family.  Of course they can only offer medication. I think I should write a book about it because that might be the only path I can take to know I didn't just dream all of this.  I know there are other women that have undergone what I went through and there are men too.  When abduction occurs you are paralyzed. You want to scream, hit,s wing, or try to communicate with them-somehow but, all the parts of your body won't work.  I could close my eyes-that's it.

A year has gone by since this Feb. event and it took me over a year to report it.  I've had all the test done to me MRI,SCAT SCAN, Blood work....I even had a doctor tell me to seek an exorcist.

Driving down Highway 90, approaching Quincy, there is a stretch where the road becomes quite straight apart from the hills.  My friend turns to me and asks,""Hey..dude..What's that?"" and points to an object in the sky with a couple lights on it.  Unconcerned, I say,""It's a plane.."" He says,""Nah dude, that's not a plane..It's not moving, look.""  I observe the light and notice that it truly is not moving.  The lights are directly in front of us, so we are getting closer and closer, and the lights remain in the same spot.   We eventually pass almost directly underneath the object. It looked like nothing that either of us had ever seen before, and we could not identify its origin, or understand how it was able to stay in the air.   We are able to distinguish a triangular craft, about 150 ft in the air.  There were three red lights, one on each corner of the underside of the craft, and a flashing white light in the center.  It appears to be between 18-25 ft long, 10-15 ft wide, and maybe 8 feet tall at the rear.  What I assume was the front was pointed, and the craft grew wider and taller towards the rear, which had a fairly flat and dark side.  There are no visible means of propulsion.  We slow down to about 30mph and I roll down my window to look up at it, attempting to capture a picture on my phone, but was unsuccessful due to the darkness.  The object was making no audible noise, and was just sitting there, hovering above the house where a mentally challenged boy lives.  After we passed under the craft, it started to slowly move south, away from the house and highway.  It was out of sight shortly after.

The only lights were two white lights on each back corner and one red slow pulsing light on the rear right between the two white lights. It was dead silent. It actually sent chills up my back b/c it was not normal. I'm very in tune with military jets and aircraft in general. I have friends that fly military planes...this was no plane...no airline...no blimp. The size of it and the fact that it was completely quiet is was gave me chills.  At first I thought it could be a blimp...but the black outline against the night sky was definitely a rectangle. It was moving very slow if it was at a low altitude...maybe a bit faster than the clouds were moving? When it passed over our house, it was almost directly overhead...maybe just a few degrees off. The altitude was hard to determine. To me it seemed to be flying at the height that the airlines fly across the city to land at the local airport...only it moving away from town towards the direction of Kinston, NC. If it was flying at the altitude of airlines, then it must have been massive. The wind is blowing out of the S towards the N at about 13mph. The rectangle was kind of moving with the direction of the wind....crossing the wind just a bit. If I had to guess the size, it would be like holding up a dominio against the sky with your hand. It was defintely above the low lying clouds..maybe about the height of a low flying airline across a city to land (only example! I can think of). It was moving from South to North.  I ran inside and yelled for my wife to come out. It was worth me missing a few seconds of watching it to have a 2nd witness. She got to see it for the last 20-30 seconds as it continue away from our house over the tree line in the back of our yard. I attempted to video it with my Flip HD but was unable to catch it in time. I jumped in the car and attempted to drive towards it in the direction it was moving. I could still see the pulsing red light off in the distance. As I drove towards it, the red pulsing light seemed to change direction and move towards the Northwest. It continued to get further away as I got stuck at several traffic lights.

My wife and I had been collecting obsidian north of Alturas, CA.  Towards the end of the day we were going to hunt Quail and then head through the back country to visit a friend in Reno which was a good distance south before heading back to the Bay Area (CA).  We decided to take a back route through a network of well maintained roads crossing from California into Nevada using HWY 299 that turns into a smooth dirt road at the Nevada border then on to forest road 8A to the 447 in Nevada.  My wife was tired and wanted to rest so I got out of the car to stretch my legs and hiked up a small hill 4-5 miles into Nevada.  One of my favorite things to do at night is hike.  I am an experienced woodsman and was just wanting to sit still on the ridge and listen to groups of coyotes howl back and forth a bit.   I could see the car from my viewpoint.   We were parked right near a roadway sign (I think it was a ""turns ahead"" style yellow triangular sign on the left side of the r! oad facing west).   After listening to the howls on this relatively still night for at least 15 minutes, I noticed a light in the sky to the east through the pass.  It was hard to gauge distance since there were no trees in the foreground for perspective.  I could go to the exact spot and point to where it was though.  The light was distant.  That's all I can say about perspective.   It started off as a still light.  I noticed it as I was scanning for my favorite constellations (It was much brighter than Polaris) and then I saw it move, I thought it might be a plane but there were no flashing indicators and it did not move like a plane or jet.  After a few seconds it shot up at incredible speed.  I am ex military.  My jaw dropped.  I knew that it was no conventional aircraft that I am aware of. It descended in a staircase type fashion at times, then would shoot upwards and make multiple maneuvers such as a rectangle (at speeds that would render a pilot unconscious due to g-fo! rce effects).  It seemed like it was testing it's ability/mane! uverability.  There was no particular pattern to it. The light changed colors from blue through the spectrum pulsing.  I watched it for what seemed like forever.  Then I went down to the car to see if it was visible from that angle and it was.  I woke up my wife and she watched it as well.  It made no sound at all. I estimate it's distance at least 2 miles away nearest ""town"" is a ghost town called ""Vya"" In the very northwestern corner of Nevada.

Ricky's older brother Dougy was 12 or 13.  We were playing in the backyard when one or more of us noticed it above the trees across the road, adjacent to a cow pasture.  We were approximately 300 ft. away from the craft at this time. The craft was long and had small colored lights along it's length. Some of these lights flashed.  As it got closer we all agreed that there were windows and we could detect movement onboard and humanoid silhouettes. It hovered for awhile and then proceeded to cross the road still above the trees. At it's closest it was only 150 ft away with only an empty lot between us.  It slowly proceeded along the tree line, pausing occasionally for a moment and then continuing on.  It landed in a clearing in the woods a couple hundred yards from the house.  A place we new well near the power-lines where we used to hike and ride snow-mobiles.  Our first thought in our excitement was: let's go see where it landed!  As we set off fear set in and we decided to walk a half mile up the road to the nearest farm house and tell an adult.  We were headed to our friend Gerald's father's farm and when we reached the edge of the yard we saw a giant fireball headed towards the earth.  It was immense and it hung in the air like it was projected somehow in the sky.  Then it suddenly disappeared just as suddenly as it had appeared. We couldn't believe our luck. First we saw a UFO and now a fireball!   We told Gerald's dad exactly what we saw and he asked a lot of questions. He didn't seem to doubt the veracity of our story.  Probably because we were so excited and it was fresh in our minds. I also told my parents and my father said he believed me. I've never reported it until now. I was looking at the maps on the NUFORC website and pondering how bright the map would look if everyone reported their sightings. It took me 41 years to write it down. After the sighting I never doubted that we were being visited by other intelligent beings. Once you see something like this you become a firm believer.  It wasn't until I read Whitley Striber's ""Communion"" around 15 years ago that I felt validated in a way.  Whitley reports that a number of people are subjected to ""screen memories"" such as images of fireballs to replace the memory of the actual encounter.  When I read this it was an ""A-ha!"" moment.  This is exactly what happened to us.  Except we happened to remember both the screen memory and the actual event. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was gone in a matter of seconds.  The other part appeared to returned southward across the highway from where it had originated but moved much more slowly than its first approach.  We watched both parts until they were out of sight.  The entire sighting took place over the course of  less than  5-10 minutes. We have never forgotten it.  We have never seen anything like it since then, but both of us believe that what we saw was not something we have seen before or since. My husband born in Denton and was 32 at the time of this sighting.  He was employed by a local municipality where he went on to work until retirement 26 years later.  We raised two children and have continued to live in Denton. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This night was clear but dark, not much of a moon. I remember this because I had dared my friend to walk across to the playground as it was unlit and two baseball fields away and it was, a dark night.  The area is nestled in the woods surrounded by trees and sparsely populated.   As we started walking we got about to the pitchers mound when the sky in front of us flashed red. The flash was not like a lingering flash; it was extremely quick and seemed to span the horizon. My friend said, ""Did you see that?""  It was very strange, and the color was vivid. I remember at the time thinking I hope it’s not the nuclear power plant exploding; the plant is about 15 miles down the coast.   As we continued walking east, I noticed an object about 20’ on the horizon coming from our 11:00 position.   My father flies as a hobby as I do now and I had grown up around airplanes.  It had red, blue and green lights in a circular pattern that were spinning. It looked like nothing I had ever seen. As we watched, it came closer, to about our 9:00 position.  It seemed to be flying parallel to the railroad tracks when it suddenly stopped.  I knew it was not a helicopter because it made no sound and no aircraft looked like this.  At this time it began coming toward us, I would say around 10-15 mph maybe.  I could see it looked like two saucers facing each other with the lights spinning in between.  It seemed to have no color that I recall.  It was about 100 feet away from us when it again stopped and a beam of light hit the ground.  The beam had a sort of bright bluish tinge. The beam of light started to scan the ground, up back left and right. I told my friend not to move or it will see us.  The object was around 100 feet high or so, it was hard to tell and it could have been 20 to 40 feet in diameter.  The beam then went off and the object proceeded to move a! bout 50 feet to our right and did the same thing with the beam, again the beam went off.  Now the object moved closer, to just above our heads and again the light hit within 10 or 15 feet away and I heard my friend start to whimper.   The light came to a point so close that I felt I could touch it, then nothing the light was gone the object was gone with no sound. We never saw it leave although I was looking at the light on the ground moving around because I didn’t want it to see us so I never actually saw it vanish, but it was gone in a second.  We both ran to my house five minutes away and told my younger brother and mother what happened.  Naturally my brother wanted to go see so we went back.  The three of us walked down a steep hill, it’s a road about 200 yards to the ball field.  Once there we saw nothing then we only walked out maybe 25 feet and the beam landed right in front of us. We all ran, my brother got to the top of the hill first and I heard a car skidding down the road,! it nearly hit him as he ran across the street. My father, a policeman in our town drove me down in the police car. I later found out the police station had got a call from someone else who also saw it. We never saw any sign of it ever again.  My friend and I went down to the ball field many nights after that just hoping to see it again, but I can never forget what I saw.

This area is very remote with dense forest and hills.   One afternoon around 4 or 5 o’clock I was taking our motor boat across the lake.  It was a beautiful day; the sky was blue and cloudless.   For some reason I looked nearly straight up and saw a flaming ""ball"" disappear over a nearby hill.  It looked as though someone had taken a paper grocery bag, wadded it up, and set it on fire and thrown it.   I would guess it was about 500 feet up because I could see it so clearly with flames trailing behind and it disappeared behind an approximately 350 foot high hill.  I would guess it was travelling about 200 mph, but this is a very rough guess as it was so long ago.   It only lasted a few seconds, but even though it happened so many years ago I can still see it very clearly in my mind.  I don’t know ! if it made any noise or not since I was sitting right next to a running outboard motor.   I have no idea why I happened to pick that moment to look straight up; perhaps I caught a glimpse of it out of the corner of my eye.   I still don’t know what to make of it; I’ve never seen anything like it since.   That’s about it, for what it’s worth. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I believe it was a Sunday. Time:  11:45pm-midnight   Location: 	 driving south on highway 95 is SE Georgia, near Kings Bay, approximately 20 minutes north of the Florida border   Observer Background: White male, age 24, in military (Navy), aviation electronics technician, honors college student, married 1 child at the time; living in Jacksonville Florida; only observation in life; generally a disbeliever until this event  Witnesses: In my vehicle – my wife’s brother who slept through most of it  That specific event – at least 100 observed Leading up to that event - Hundreds, possibly thousands  Description: Glowing/pulsing round ball of yellow light, turning yellow/orange when changing directions, then back to yellow.  Approximate sixe was up to 50’ diameter. No sound, no disturbance of ground objects – just a big yellow ball. Weather was clear, bright moon-light night with only a couple thin clouds far off in the distance. Encounter:  1.0-While driving south on highway 95, I witnessed a glowing/pulsing yellow ball of light on or very near the ground across the opposite side of the highway. The ball of light was visible for over a mile while approaching, and was located approximately 100 yards into the woods on the east side of the road. The woods consisted of a pine tree farm with very specific rows/density of pine trees. The light provided by the object was bright enough to establish a clear definition of the numbers of rows and size of trees (established distance into the woods) for a fairly accurate guesstimate of its size and location. 2.0-I slowed my vehicle to a crawl to get a better look at the object and pulled off the right side of the road. I sat in the vehicle, observing the object (Okay, staring in disbelief) for approximately 30 seconds with the window rolled up, but decided to roll it down to listen for sound – there was none. I continued to sit in the van for approximately another minute and noticed in my rear view mirror, several (4-5) other cars behind me with passengers watching the object. When the driver of the car behind me got out of his car, I also got out and began walking across the highway with him towards the object. It was at that time I realized several cars (5-6) had also stopped on the opposite side of the road, closer to the object. None of those occupants appeared to be out of their automobiles. During this time, many (20-30) cars also slowed down to look, but did not stop. 3.0-Before I got across the road (south-bound lanes of highway 95), the object changed from pulsing yellow to solid yellow/orange and began a slow but steady rise out of the trees. At this point all automobile occupants who had left their vehicles immediately returned to them, with most driving away at very high rates of speed. I decided to stay, after running as fast as I could back to my vehicle. The object hovered above the trees and immediately returned to a pulsing yellow. The hovering lasted approximately another 20 seconds. During that time all but one or two of the other cars left the area but many more slowed down to watch without stopping. There continued to be no sound coming from the object. 4.0-The object again turned yellow/orange and began to move away at a slow speed. It moved in a southerly direction at a consistent altitude of approximately 200-300 feet above the trees. There was absolutely no sound and no tree movement under the object. I started my vehicle and began to follow the object south on 95. After about 1 minute of stable, horizontal flight, the object turned yellow/orange again, and abruptly stopped. It hovered above the trees, returning to yellow.  It was no longer pulsing but was a consistent bright yellow. It hovered there long enough for me to catch up to its location and pull off the road again. This required less than 15 seconds. 5.0-As I was pulling my vehicle off the road, the object again turned a yellow/orange and began a slow ascent, at approximately the same speed as it was travelling horizontally south. The yellow/orange turned back to all yellow almost immediately. The object continued to rise for approximately 10 seconds, when it turned yellow/orange again. 6.0-From where I was sitting in the vehicle, on an elevated overpass, I could see out to the eastern horizon with sufficient clarity to make out land, water, and thin/small clouds with help from a near full moon. The object, which had returned to yellow/orange momentarily, then back to yellow, sped away completely over the horizon, behind the clouds, reappearing again after them, all in less than 2 seconds. No sound, nothing – just gone. At a speed I had never seen or imagined possible. After Encounter:  1.0-Because I had an established habit of ridiculing people who had claims of seeing UFOs, I told no one of the encounter, until it began showing up on the news and in the newspapers.  Based on what they reported, this, or an identical object had been seen all across the southern United States during that weekend – from Arizona to SE Georgia. It had been witnessed by hundreds, possibly thousands of people according to the news reports. I believe this may also be the UFO reported seen by President Jimmy Carter in 1976, a Georgia resident at that time.  It’s been too long to remember why I thought that. I do remember his Playboy interview where he disclosed that he had seen a UFO. 2.0-Approximately 3 days after the sighting, another person located where I work admitted to seeing the object but had hesitated to admit it because of the stigma associated with seeing a UFO.  I asked him for a description and location and he described the EXACT object in exact detail, flying almost exactly the same – west to east, yellow except when changing directions, on the ground, then hovering, ascending, and then disappearing over the horizon at unbelievable speed.  His location and time was approximately 10:30pm in south western Georgia.  He was returning from a trip to Atlanta. 3.0-I admitted to seeing the same object and provided the crew at work with the description provided here – and of course received the appropriate amount of heckling. I never mentioned it to anyone other than my wife again until now. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2011-01-31T00:00:00,,

The sky was clear with just a few scattered clouds. I had originally gone out to see what was happening, as about an hour earlier, a pair of Blackhawk helicopters were circling the area, extremely low with only their battle lights on.  I ended up looking at the stars after they left.  At 2152 hrs I noticed what seemed to be a satellite approaching from the south, about 30 degrees above the horizon. It was moving rather slow for a satellite and moving towards the northwest.  It started as a dim white color but began increasing in size and intensity.  Just when I thought I was about to see a good iridium flare, I realized that instead of flaring and then subsiding, this object was continuing to increase in size and brilliance.  It became huge, larger and brighter than Saturn visible to the west, and the color was now an unusual shade of light green around the edge and brilliant white in the center.  It appeare! d to be self-illuminated and not reflecting the sun.  It remained at its brightest for several seconds, then it suddenly went completely dark for a fraction of a second, then returned with full brilliance.  Concurrent with this display, I noticed a small, white object shooting off to the west at a slight downward angle.  The white object looked like a small, very slow meteor leaving a short trail.  It appeared slightly below the green object and quite a bit to the right of it, but the trajectory of the white object in relation to the green object gave me the impression it had shot out from it. (It is possible that it was just a meteor as there was nothing unusual about it other than its appearance and proximity to the green object.)  The green object, after re-appearing, remained illuminated for a about a second, then rapidly diminished in size and became completely dark. It did not just blink off but seemed to ""power down."" At 2202 hrs., I saw a two more objects one after another, almost directly overhead going from south to north. They performed similarly to the large green object, but did not become as bright and they remained white in color.  They too grew in intensity, flashed on and off several times and then went dark.  I checked the Heavens Above website and discovered that there were NO iridium satellites visible from my location on that date, and the other known objects that were visible were not overhead at the times or locations of these sightings.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,33.93964338565022,-117.4001158071749

The source was moving wards the north-northeast in a smooth steady motion, which I estimated given its relative distance of roughly one quarter mile from my position to be traveling at between fifty and seventy mph. As it flew, the source appeared to make a small, very smooth deviation from the straight course it had been following when I initially noted it, and in a long lazy arc came to a complete stop in the sky approximately at an angle of sixty degrees above the horizon, wherein it seemed to perform a complete stop and then in a matter of seconds faded away to nothingness (this effect may have been achieved by the source moving away from me on an easterly course, gradually being lost from view, or by some other means). I was able at the time to motion capture approximately fifty-nine seconds of the source objects flight using a Kodak EasyShare C813 8.0 MP camera, which when played back seemed to indicate that it was spinning, and was not entirely orange in color.  Instead, brilliant instances of white and a very brilliant and distinct blue hue were also in evidence. Sadly, due to my initial attempts at sighting the camera on a moving object set against a black sky and under less than ideal circumstances, the initial footage is shaky, but still clear enough for it to be clear enough for analysis.  At the time of the incident, the sky was heavily overcast with broken slow moving clouds.  There was a full moon, and the source appeared to be moving along some distance below the cloud base.   I wish to point out that the route on which the object was seen is part of the regular flight path for aircraft coming into Southampton Airport, yet it was moving counter to the established route and was seen to be carrying lights ((which were not)) consistent with known aircraft. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Peter,   My apologies, that was an obvious and somewhat unfortunate mistake on my part. The date should read, July 31st 2010, not August as you so rightly pointed out.   Also, be advised that a small typo should be amended, it is ""yet it was moving counter to the established route and was seen to be carrying lights consistent with known aircraft,"" which should read:   ""...yet it was moving counter to the established route and was seen to be carrying lights which were not consistent with known aircraft.""   Thank you.   If you are interested in the footage, it is just under 60 seconds long and in MOV format just under 18MB long. If you know of any reliable means wherein I can send that securely without correuption and at a lower file size, I would be interested in hearing about it.   Thank you for contacting me.   I have an additional comment to add.  I have only just learned from my father who lives at the nearby village of Fair Oak, Hampshire, some seven and one half miles from me that on the night of August 25th, approximately 22:50 hours, he observed two independently operating orange spherical light sources.  In the course of the observation, the objects travelled an undisclosed distance, probably no more than one quarter miles knowing the viewpoint that he had, and from south to northeast.   The sighting was terminated when one of the objects stopped abruptly in mid-flight and shot straight up at considerable speed, followed five seconds later by the second, both subsequently vanishing from sight.    I can attempt to obtain additional details, but this is certainly curious given the nature of the object that I personally observed and managed to capture in motion.   Thanks.

At first thought it was a bright star. However, having grown up my entire life (over 30 years) in the area, I knew it couldn't be a plane, and it wasn't a helicopter because I didn't see or hear any rotor-blades. I stopped my car, turned off the engine, and rolled down the window and looked out. I heard no noise as the craft slowly passed overhead going roughly southeast - it was low enough at this point to know for sure that there was no engine/rotor noise. It was roughly 300-400 feet above, and its speed was a slow 15 mph or so. It was a black triangle, with bright white lights on each of the three tips. I could definitely see the shape of the black craft against the dark, night sky. There were two thin white light lines parallel to one another and close together, in the center of the craft pointing in the direction it was moving. It was around 25 feet wide or so. Again, no noise at all. There was also a red light behind it that was bl! inking very fast at times as well. I didn't know what to think about it at first, so I rolled up the window, started the car and went on driving. After about 15 seconds or so, I got a very nervous feeling that maybe this was something that could not easily be explained. Since it wasn't a plane, helicopter, or anything with an engine, the only other explanation would be a glider or a remote controlled vehicle, however this area of Orinda is one of the highest points, so a glider wouldn't be a practical explanation. Also, anything remote controlled would presumably make some sort of noise, and at 20 - 30 feet from tip to tip, that would be a big remote flying machine.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,37.8772,-122.1797

At first, I thought it was the streetlight but I realized that it was shaking and moving across the sky. I turned my head and saw that it was two orange spheres, seeming to shake rapidly as they moved smoothly and silently across the sky. They looked like they were made of light. One was in front and higher in the sky than the second light, but they moved perfectly synchronized. They were moving east to west. Once they were almost in front of us, they stopped moving in the sky, stopped shaking too. They just froze and hovered for a few seconds. They were orange balls about the size of the full moon. They seemed to be flat, like 2D, and multifaceted like bicycle reflectors. But it was hard to understand what they really were. What happened next is hard to explain: They were hanging in the air, one higher and more to the left of the other. Then, simultaneously, they shifted in the air so that the higher one was now in the lower position and the lower one was now in the higher position. They froze again. Then they shifted back and froze. Then, they just LEFT. They ascended into the stars just fast enough for your eyes to follow – FAST. Up, gone, away. They didn't seem to accelerate, just suddenly gone. It was amazing and I will never forget. Years later, I thought they must have known we were watching but who knows?  I swear to this story.

We both turned our heads to see where the jet was and when we turned back around the UFO was gone. We didn't see where the jet went because went back inside after the UFO disappeared.  No clouds no sound, not even a dog or bird made any noises. Cell phone showed a blur. The UFO was Very shiny ,no wings no light could be seen. It was bigger that a 747 jet and traveled slower than any plane could have.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,33.7704,-85.0115

Weather was clear, no wind to speak of. The objects flashed, with orange light (did not blink on and off) like a strobe effect. Both were larger and brighter than stars appear. Point of observation is atop a hill about 1 mile south of MO river, situated below regular MCI and downtown airport flight paths (aircraft such as commercial jets, small planes, helicopters frequently overhead). These objects were not moving: neither to either side, nor becoming larger or smaller for several moments. I called my husband to see them. The uppermost object then moved away rapidly into the northwest sky. The lower object remained stationary for another several minutes (I had time to get my telescop! e from another part of the room and aim it at the object). The object remained where it was; a regular plane flew over the space with normal movement toward airport, but the hovering object did not move at all. Finally it very slowly moved upward (judged by power line in foreground) and then away toward the northwest(in the same direction as the one before had gone) and was quickly no longer visible. Could not tell how far away or at what altitude, but compared to the commercial jet it was (estimated) about half the size of the fuselage of the jet and at about the same altitude, but seemed more distant  – no wings were apparent.

I was driving down Bonifant Road in Silver Spring, Maryland.  It was particularly cloudy out, so there were no stars visible in the sky.  As I was approaching New Hampshire Avenue on Bonifant, I saw what I first thought was a star constellation, formed out of bright orange/red circles.  There were five circles in a formation that at first resembled the big dipper, except without the scooper portion of the dipper itself.  The circles seemed lower than the clouds, and a color I have not seen on any aircraft at night. During this time, I called my girlfriend to get her to go outside to see if she could see what I was seeing.  While communicating with her on the phone, I pulled off on a side street just after Notley Road.  I was able to see at this points that the circles were not stationary as they first seemed, but were actually moving.  I'm not sure if they were moving the whole time or not, but I traveled a relatively short distance before noticing them moving, so I feel that I would have noticed them prior to pulling off on the side street.  Once on the side street, I drove up a little ways, and seemed to be directly under the 5 orange circles, still spaced a pretty good distance apart, best compared to the spacing of looking at the stars that form the big dipper.  I turned onto a second neighborhood street to follow the direction they were moving, all the while talking to my girlfriend, aside from one call to my brother, to see if he could see them as well, but to no avail. The second neighborhood street was a culdesac, so I turned around the circle, at which point I noticed two to three new circles of the same size and color, and at what appeared to be an equal spacing as the previous five from the previous five.  They appeared to be moving in the same direction as the first five that I witnessed. These crafts appeared to be lower to the ground than the storm clouds, as stars were not visible due to the clouds.  After this point, I made a point to try to observe airplanes in the area to compare to what I saw.  These circles were different in that you couldn't gather a distinctive shape, whereas sometimes with a jet you can pick up multiple lights in different parts of the craft, or perhaps even an outline of the jet.  Usually if it's a jet, you can at least make out the shape of the craft until a point where it gets so high in the sky, that it appears to be like a moving star sized object.  These circles appeared to be two to three times the size of a jet that is high up in the sky and resembling a moving star, but notably lower to the earth.  They appeared to be moving quickly, and I was unable to discern any shape to the craft, even right I turned onto the side street and was directly beneath them. I'm not sure what to make of this.  I'm an open-minded person, but this was quite alarming to me for a number of reasons.  I have never seen jets or planes with lights of this color, brightness and size.  It was a bright, single solid orange color for each of the dots.  Additionally, because of the storm clouds, these stood out on the sky well apart from stars since stars were hardly visible.  Thirdly, they appeared to be stationary prior to moving.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,39.03697964869776,-77.02814088431253

I then ignored it and thought of it as 2 fighter jets that had their engines off. So about half an hour later I was up on the 7 metre start hill and then noticed the 2 objects again.

On the left side of the road, approximately 50 feet in from the edge of the roadway, an incredibly intense blue light appeared.  The intensity was that of an arc welder, but  was about the size of a dumpster.  It had a distinct shape also. I continued talking to my Sister, but was mesmerized by this light.

The exact date is 12.06.2010 at 2:00 Am in Bulgaria, Sofia.  First I would like to apologize for my English, cos I am not from USA or other English speaking country but I will try my best to explain everything as detail as possible. Ok I will start from there that I am a young guy who likes sports, dont drink, dont smoke nothing, only healthy life, I am saying this, cos I was not hallucinating or something!!!  I am very interested in UFOs since I was little, now I am 27 and I am obsessed with the subject.   When I am at home after work I am watching all kind of documentaries about it, everything there is on Discovery, History channels and so on.   So one night when I finished watching a docu about ufos, I said to myself - ok thats it, I am tired of only watching about it and about all those fake ufo clips on youtube so I decided to look for myself. It was June very warm weather I looked outside from my window, I am living in a 9 story building and I am on the highest floor, when i looked up I saw that the sky was absolutely clear, so many stars and I said to myself omg I got to go on the roof and start watching the sky every single night, inside myself I knew I would see something, cos up there high I can see the whole sky more clearly and without the distraction of the street lights.  So when everybody was sleeping I got there I took even a blanket to lie down and look at the sky till the morning that was my plan. It was Friday I stayed for like an hour and I saw a meteor fly by it was so beautiful and at that moment I thought to myself wow when this meteor can enter the planet Earth so easy everything can and I stayed like half an hour more and got back to my apartment.  That was my first try, I was very happy thou that I saw something moving not only the stars but that was only the beginning. On the next evening was the actual sighting, so the same story I get there around 1:00 am and laid down on the blanket and actually I was prepared to see another meteor I was convinced that there are ufos but didnt expect to see what I saw, its crazy! So around 2:00 am I saw this time a bigger meteor to fly by and it was destroyed by the atmosphere into peaces very high in the sky, it was beautiful, so I got on my feet and start watching it and after 30 sec I saw the meteor the sighting began!  So I was staying on my feet and still watching up high cos wanted to see more meteors maybe but what I saw I couldnt believe my eyes!   So the meteor was burned out and 30 sec after I saw him I was still looking up and saw a light cant tell the exact color red or violet was falling from very high in the sky down to the roof in a spiral fashion it was unbelievable like a dance and I thought to myself wow a peace of the meteor is falling down yay I am a lucky one, I saw a meteor very high in the sky and its gonna fall a 6 meters in front of me wow what are the chances but thats what I thought cos I didn't expect something else! So this light was falling down in a spiral fashion from very high very slowly and when it was around 6 meters in front of me so close and the same height as me so in front my eyes I just step back one step cos I was like wow its gonna fall on the roof but when it was on my height falling in a spiral fashion it just start to fly straight in front of me but not straight I mean left right up down it was like dancing and then I was like ooo my God that is not a meteor, it flies! I was very scared, what the hell is that I didnt have time cos I look to my left guess what another light falling down this time like a ""falling leaf"" fashion left right, left right and when was in front of my eyes height it flew in the direction of the other ufo and it was absolutely silent no noise at all only flying and it look like it defies gravity up down, left right so smooth it was like magical I was like watching those fan tasy movies watching magical lights flying by me no sound no nothing I immediately call them fairies cos they were so beautiful no sound at all, so after the second one I turned to my right a 3rd light falling and flying in the direction of the first one.  And when I look at them how they are flying it looked to me that they were intelligent, cos they were flying so like they were looking for something left right up down and like scanning the surface. So I was there all alone on the block of flat at 2:30 am and those lights were like dancing and wanting to show me their presence I dont know but I was scared and started to fall back and when I was going back a 4th light flew over my shoulder and I was like omg I am out of here on the way back I was looking in every direction, cos I didnt know from where they will appear I was scared I coudnt hear a thing only with my eyes I was like turning my head in every possible direction and when I got to the door to exit the roof a 5th one flew over my head omg I am out and I ran the stairs down to my flat, I was all shaken!   This is absolutely unbelievable! I stayed at my apartment like 15 min and was looking up from the window and saying to myself omg some lights (or fairies like I call them immediately) are flying up there and I am staying here I have to go back not everybody is seeing this I have to be crazy not to go there this is unbelievable!  So my curiosity was bigger than I was scared and i got back there. When I arrived I was looking at every possible direction cos I knew I coldnt hear them only seeing them. It was 3:00 am and I waited till 3:30 and I was trying to convince myself that I was hallucinating and to go back to my apartment, cos actually i was scared :D and I said to myself ok last look up to the sky till my neck hurts and I am out and when I looked up immediately it just flew over my head about a 2 meters above it, it flew so smooth I can describe it like when you make an airplane from paper and throw it, it flies so smooth and make a smooth turn to my left and just disappeared I even saw it very clearly, cos was above my head and I could see it in more detail it looked something like a rc mini airplane I can even describe it, it looked like 2 dots connected with a minus sign something like that *-* and had a haze around it, but there was no mist or something it was absolutely clear night, but when it flew it had some green glow around it, it was like going th! rough the space and I can even make another comparison, when there is a mist and the lights of the car is on, around the lights there is some kind of glow cos of the mist this is what it looked like but was a clear night, it was unbelievable, and I was like ""There it is ooo my God!"" (I was talking with voice to myself all the time, cos this was something that cant be explained) and I got out of there and that was my story. It went 9-10 months from that sighting and I cant go back there cos its still cold.  I cant wait to get warm to go there again, but this time I am very scared cos I know what to expect, don’t saying that this was something scary but those lights were something out of this world and when the human brain sees something that cant be explained, it is scary.  That day I didnt expect anything to happen but now I know and i am 100% convinced that they will return, cos they know I am looking for them and I am even convinced that they are even flying every single day and night but we cant see them, cos they are invisible and only if they want to show their presence they will light their light and glow, cos when I saw the last light and when made a turn to the left it just disappeared, so they can be flying without we even know it. I hope someone has a similar experience and tell me what that is. Thank you in advance! Bye guys! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

A few nights later i saw an even bizzare dream.it was so real that i often think wether i am not suffering from sleep paralysis.in my dream i saw three people wearing black robes ,black coats,with black hoods.i couldn't see their face.it was so real because i saw that i was on my bed and these people were standing right near my feet.then i started fighting with one of them and they stopped me and said that they are here to help me.then they started telling me that it all started during the THIRD REICH.THEY TOLD ME ABOUT THE WANDERWAFFEN.HITLER HAD PLANS TO MAKE AN ATOM BOMB VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE CONVENTIONAL ONE .
