Close to 5 AM several fast moving lights flew above me in a somewhat straight line. Each one looked mostly round with a slight triangle shape at the end. They flew by in an interesting pattern. One would appear then quickly shine bright for just a moment and then go back to it’s normal lighting that was equivalent to a stars lighting. Then the next one would do the same. None of them shined bright at the same time and they all only shined extremely bright once. They somehow shined brightest in the exact same spot in the sky.  They kept appearing out of nowhere and then quickly passed me by. It was beautiful and I first thought I was seeing meteors, but they didn’t have the same appearance. They were somewhat close together, I’d say each new appearance was about 4 seconds behind the last one. I couldn’t believe how fast they moved and just how close they seemed.  I immediately googled it to see what I saw and I came across the Elon Musk satellites and thought maybe that was it, but I watched the video of those satellites to compare and it was not the same. This was not a perfectly straight line nor was it lit looking circles. They were close to circles, but more like a shape I haven’t seen before. Almost like how a child draws a fish with a circle and a triangle, but still slightly different than that and soundless. It was like my whole town was muted and I heard nothing, but myself saying, “Wow!”.  Lemoore is home to a naval base so I was hoping that someone else caught this, but so far have not seen any news of it. I watch the sky most evenings and have found that the later I am out there, the more I see moving. Mostly I see satellites, but I have seen quite a few lights that were headed one way then quickly went up, down, or completely opposite of where it was going. Some have flown so close to one another and then stop and from my perspective it looks like they are having a standoff of some sort. Maybe curiosity toward each other or territorial issues. I’m not sure, but I am definitely never going to forget those moments.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,36.29200975609756,-119.82940609756098

My young children love the moon, so I looked up at the sky to point it out to them. Next to the moon we saw a bright mass about 1 hands width away from the moon. The object looked like a super bright, white star that was about 10 times larger than a ""regular"" star. If I held a flax seed in my fingers and put it against the sky at arms length, this is about the size the object seemed to be in the sky. My two older children (6 and 4), my husband, and my mom were all able to see the object. The object was stationary upon my first observations. The color was a bright white. The object had better clarity than the moon and was more white than the moon. The moon looked grey or bluish next to the object. The object appeared to be slightly darker in the center and the shape was ever so slightly oblong. It was immediately obvious that it was a new feature in the sky. W! e watched it for several minutes and took a video and pictures. We then continued on our walk and periodically while on our walk, we checked the object and noted its position relative to the moon. The moon was on its path across the sky, but the object seemed to shift from one to two hand lengths from the moon over the next 5 hours. The color never changed, except that as the sun rose higher in the sky,the darker center seemed to lighten up. This could have been due to more light in sky from the sun.  I contacted relatives across the US. Locations were Wyoming, Arizona, and Ohio. Ohio sky was covered by rain clouds  and Wyoming sky was covered by forest fire smoke. My step sister in Arizona could not see the object where she was.  Between 9am and 10am I sat outside and watched the object with my kids. I tried to determine all I could. It did not change shape or color. The Location did change over the time it was viewable, but the movement was as gradual as the moons movement. It seemed to stay between 1 and 2 hand-widths away from the moon. It was 100% obvious in the sky. It looked like a bright white star that was about 10 times larger than a star. Initially (7am), the object was 45 degrees up from the horizon, but by 11am, the object was just about straight above me. The shift was gradual, as slight as the moon shifting positions.  Around 11am, I drove to my mom's house in Gulf Breeze Florida. She was able to see the object as well from her location. When I arrived at her location, the  clouds obstructed my view but the clouds were low and moving fast so I was able to check the  location over the next few hours. I left Gulf Breeze around 4pm and there were too many clouds in the sky for me to determine the objects location. The last view was around 2pm. The object was straight up in the sky.  My husband was working on Hurlburt field from 11am until 10pm on this day. Clouds obstructed his view for much of the day. The sky was clear by his drive home around 9 pm, but the object was not in the sky as far he could tell. He took pictures of the object as well.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,30.697336723163843,-87.05111638418079

No airfields or bases were around our location, though there are both most likely in a 25 mile radius. We were in a big empty open field near her house that we like to go to often and sit and talk when she gets out of work and doesn't have enough time to do much else before going home. This night, a Tuesday, approximately 8:30-8:45 pm, the sky was clear with not even a cloud in sight. I had the idea of getting out of my car and looking at the night sky to see how beautiful Mars looked. Because there were no street lights around, one could see the whole sky in full in all its glory and beauty. We were talking, saw a shooting star, and then continued conversation for another few minutes. Then we laid on the hood of my car and I noticed this little grey cloud above us. I didn't think anything of it besides ""wow, only one little cloud and nothing else."" I turned my head back towards her for roughly 5 or 6 sec! onds as we continued talking, and then we both happened to look up at the same time and she quit talking as we were both dumbfounded as to what we were witnessing. At first I thought the stereotypical ""its a bird"" but the wings were not moving. Then of course ""maybe its a plane or a drone"". I said to my girlfriend, ""babe, do you see..."" and she said ""I'm looking right at it"". It was a U shaped craft, more like a boomerang, the width of maybe a large bus, gliding completely silent over us. It looked otherworldly. Translucent. I felt like I could almost see through it yet it was solid. It was gray, but blacked out with no lights and if any clouds were above it I swear it would have been invisible. There was no smoke or anything behind it. It was just this blacked out huge silent boomerang about 100-150 feet above the treetops on the outskirts of the field gliding and ZIG-ZAGGING from left to right, yet staying completely flat. Just as q! uickly as it came, it went. Directly afterward, a dog in the d! istance and same direction the UFO had traveled began barking very loud and uncontrollable. I told my girlfriend to research ""boomerang shaped UFO"" right after we determined we have never seen anything like that in our lives, and we found this webpage, https://www.huffpost.com/entry/boomerang-ufo-zigzags-ove_b_6221676.

It was a clear, calm night about one hour after sunset and I was the first person to spot the craft directly over head (90 degrees above the horizon) and my wife was the second to see the object seconds later in front of us (about 45 degrees above the horizon) while we were walking due East on the beach toward the ocean. I saw the dark boomerang-shaped object for approximately 8 seconds and my wife saw it for about 4 seconds. The object was completely silent and was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed but did not appear to be accelerating. The object completely disappeared into the horizon very quickly and had two, very dim red lights on the bottom-side of what appeared to be the wing-tips or “ends” of the boomerang. It was difficult to assess the altitude of the vehicle,! but we both estimated it could have been between 250 to 500 meters above the ground. The size of the object was also very difficult to ascertain but it was quite large as the event happened so quickly. I don’t think many people really understand how difficult it really is to approximate altitude or size of objects when these events occur so quickly during the night like a flash in time and with no time to react to perhaps take a photo or video with our phones. I am not sure even if we had the wherewithal to snap a photo if it would have even registered due to the darkness of both the night and the object and the remarkable dim red lights of what might be described as a nearly dead battery powering these two points of light at both ends of the object. I am an engineer and a former surveyor and I have had previous training in distance, angles, measurements, and orienteering prior to the use of the most modern technology, but I still am having difficulty with the size, altitu! de and velocity of what we saw that night flying through the s! ky. What ever it was, we both thought it was not of this world. It is also worth mentioning that the night sky was completely clear and star-lit, with the milky-way starting to become visible toward the East over the Atlantic Ocean; however, there was still a small amount of light over the western horizon from the recent sunset. There was no moon or artificial light present during our sighting and we were truly amazed at what we saw together as this was the first type of observation of this nature for either of us. It is important to note that we live in a village where we see almost no commercial air traffic and due to the coronavirus pandemic almost all flights have been grounded in Argentina due to government restrictions. When we do see aircrafts, this may occur once per week (or sometimes once per month) and they are typically flying at cruising altitude maybe at 8000 meters (very, very high above sea level) and what we saw that night was nothing like a commercial aircraft with ! exhaust trails taking minutes to traverse the sky and only observable during daylight.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,,

I am also a bit of a weekend warrior space nerd and am familiar with ""looking up"" to admire the sky, space station passes, sky safari and NASA apps, that sort of thing so I do realize the various and sometimes seamingly abnormal or environmental/weather variables and being a self-employed remodeling contractor, realize that different angles can be misleading especially with depth perception and other Earthly phenomenon. Having said that just for clarification that I am not easily impressed or wild at things in the sky I did I do rationally make the ductions for everything in life, however this was nothing like anything I've ever seen. Bees two objects that originally caught my attention where somewhere in our atmosphere I would say distance wise. Other than that, I have no way of comparing distance to make specific, only that the intense color like a fire almost these two objects were lit up so bright I immediately started thinking about how. As stated, the distance looked like it was too close to be lit up by the Sun as a space station is, these were definitely self-generated lights. Unlike crafts with specifically placed marker lights and strobe lights, these were solid and color and did not blink or give other indicators of a typical aircraft. Speeds where unimpressive and nothing out of the ordinary as someone that is located near airportsis used too. Within five seconds of seeing these objects, I ran inside to alert my family members, pass through the house to the front yard, as 2 more objects we're moving across behind the first set. As those pass by and went behind building in trees horizon, 2 more preceded by in the same fashion, at a slightly faster Pace but still ordinary. As stated, nothing two impressive or attention-getting about anything besides the intense color of t! hese objects. Though these objects were much larger, the overa! ll tone almost looked like Mars on a very clear night. Family member that was immediately behind me after I ran through the house and alerted them, immediately saw what I was looking for and said outloud ""oh my gosh what is that that's definitely not normal"" and proceeded  to repeat ""that's not normal"" several times and I have to say, she was right. I did pull out my cell phone and do you have the objects on video, however being at night time and zooming in at distance while probably shaking from adrenaline or such, needless to say the object in my video looks like anything would look at a distance at night time on a  shakey cell phone and is pointless to review for furthering of any conclusive facts or answers. If it was not for this intense color, I would have assumed these were group formations going to McGuire Air Force Base approximately 40 miles away these however we're no aircraft that I've ever seen before or knew existed. Do not know what I saw exactly b! ut I know I've never seen anything like it before and again, that is only because of the intense color and how odd it was with no other identification or typical characteristics. Hard to describe in an impressive manner but I can only say it was impressive enough to leave a lasting impression on me.  Don't have any evidence to base this off of obviously, but when I'm looking at something I can judge it pretty well as I said, gauging distance I immediately thought of the space station but this was too close to be out of Earth's Shadow. Definitely self generated lighting and it looked to be over the entirety of these objects. Not just strategically placed Lighting in specific places, almost like an exterior shell of all LED panels one would say as an example, where the entire viewable surface is 1 seamless solid light.  I will also add, in video at night viewing any lit object, everything appears to look exactly like I just described. In person however, these objects were clo! se enough to see how it 100% truly was illuminated.  No sound ! Was Hear d, which again was not out of the ordinary, due to the distance being far enough away to fit with typical airplane sightings and the sound of associated with them through muscle memory I suppose.

Subject:  UFO Report:  10/14/2020, 11:30 p.m. EST  To Whom It May Concern:  I left my sister's house on [street name hidden] Way on Wednesday, 10/14/2020 at 11:30 pm EST (23:30 hours).  As I drove down the street, I noticed lights ahead that were hovering over a house and not moving.  I slowed down so I could try to make out what I was seeing.  It was a large object (around 30 FT wide & 20 FT tall) hovering in the sky about roughly 50 feet above the roof of the house directly across the street from the [street name hidden] Way stop sign.  Anyone with a good baseball arm could have thrown a stone and hit it.  As I approached the stop sign, I realized it was a lot bigger than I thought- jet black and I could only make out the outline of the craft against the night sky...there were no other markings that I saw, only the lights and outline. It also made no sound that I could hear.  I did have my windows up, but the neighborhood was completely silent and no one was outside so if it did display an engine-type sound, I should have been able to hear that considering how close I was to this thing (probably around 150 ft away from me).  It had 2 yellow lights on either side of the craft and 3 red lights in the middle. It looked like an upside-down bell but a little wider, more triangle shaped but with rounded edges, and the lights were on the front, not on the side or underneath.  It was very thick...very solid looking--not flat. There was nothing protruding on the craft, no wings or blades. It was very large, as I mentioned before--like the size of my living room w/ vaulted ceilings.  My first thought was this must be a VERY expensive military surveillance drone due to its size but why the heck is it hovering in our community this late at night?!?  It started moving toward me so I floored the gas and sped away as fast as I could. I wasn't sure if it was following me until I turned left on [street name hidden] Ct and there it was.  It was on my left moving VERY slowly over the houses on [street name hidden] Ct. heading in the direction of [school name hidden] High School. I raced down the road and pulled into my garage, jumped out to take a picture of it and it was already gone. I have to tell you, that was the most frightening thing I've ever encountered.  I made a police report the next day (10/15/2020) and the officer confirmed that “none of their drones were outside at time” and “their drones are only 24 INCHES wide.”  I did not take any pics or videos because I was seriously so frightened of being abducted that I could not look away.  I did, however, press my sister’s phone number that is saved on my vehicle’s home screen to call my sister via bluetooth.  She can attest that I was screaming, “Come outside! Come outside!  I think I’m witnessing a UFO!!”  She thought I was joking and hung up.  I’ve included a hand-drawn picture of what I saw.  Thank you for looking into this matter.  If it was military, it is quite concerning that they are in a residential neighborhood flying so close to houses.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,34.23837495219885,-77.87846768642447

At first i believed this to be a drone. The object did not move, I called my girlfriend over to witness as she did not notice it until i pointed it out to her. The light was very orange and out of place not the same color as the street light. To our amazement the orb then begin to come close to us remaining about a street lamp post and a half in the sky, extremely close. I thought now I will be able to just tell myself this is drone or some other logical explanation.  However it flew directly above me and I was able to get an extremely close look. The orb almost looks like it was pulsating with fire inside of it. There was no sound, noise, streaks, it just silently flew over top of us and flew in between my girlfriend's house and the neighbor and due it to being overcast was not able to keep track of it for long as it was swallowed up by the clouds as it ascended South East. I have seen things in the past but this was definitely the closest I have been to one of theses objects and luckily had someone there to experience with me to confirm i was not seeing things.  It was not captured in any form as I was using my iPhone to my girlfriends cell phone to monitor our infant son like a baby monitor. iPhone 7 plus would not allow me to record while on the phone and it happened under 120 seconds so i was not able to grasp what i was really seeing until it was right on top of me and by that time was on its ascendance. Which is really a shame as I probably would of made global headlines for how close I truly was to this Orange Orb.  After further researching I can confirm what i witnessed was a part of the orange orb Phenomenon which was picked up sightings from what I can tell in my research in the last 20 years significantly.  Terry Ray Ufologist has gone in depth in his book explaining that these Orange Orb sightings are now essentially the most common seen. i hope to talk to someone about it but doubt i will ever be contacted.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,43.86382482269504,-79.03527411347518

I was talking to a friend on the phone when I said “There’s something hovering in the night sky.” I walked over to my balcony narrating what I was seeing to my friend. There was a group of about 12 lights clumped together in the north sky. The night sky was clear but there was only a single star lower from the group of lights that I saw. The lights ran parallel in two rows 6 in each row. The lights did not move until I started to take some pictures. Some I took through a screen door and others I took directly from the balcony in the night air. Only one picture remained on my phone camera. It was as if they did not want to be photographed and began squiggling and jerking. Were they moving or was the camera moving? Good question. I would say both. As! they moved I was desperately trying to capture their movement. I should have started the video:-) Other lights moved away from the squiggly lights and looked like it could have been a plane. I know this may sound strange but it’s like there was a meeting in the sky between a UFO and a plane.

I am a fifty-nine year old male writer. My distance vision is excellent.  At about 10:45 pm, on October 16th, 2020, I was walking eastbound on Arcola Street in Burnaby, BC, Canada, near the Tommy Douglas library. The area is semi-urban.  I stopped to look up, south by southeast. The sky in that direction was mainly clear and Mars was very bright. Small cumulus clouds were blowing past rapidly, eastward, creating a picturesque view.  The clouds appeared to be at an altitude of about 1,000 feet over my position – roughly 1,400 feet above sea level.  I suddenly became aware of something unusual in my field of view: an extremely large, chevron-shaped object, moving at roughly the same altitude as the clouds blowing past. It was, however, flying directly opposite the direction of the clouds, westbound. It seemed to meander in the sky, following a curved path. Its speed was leisurely.  Given its approximate altitude, based on its interaction with the clouds, the object appeared to be several times the size of a Boeing 747. It showed no lights, but was illuminated by light sources on the ground.  I can only guess at the color of the object, as it seemed to reflect the ambient light, blending in with the color of the sky. Equally, it may have been semi-transparent. Its sharp, perfectly geometric shape, however, was highly visible.  I listened carefully and heard no sound whatsoever. A jet aircraft would have been extremely loud at that altitude.  (My location was about 26 km from the Vancouver International Airport in Richmond, B.C. (16 miles.)  The object did not follow a straight path, but curved back and forth in the sky, oddly like a gigantic bird riding the wind.  I was able to observe the object for approximately one minute. It moved steadily westbound, disappearing behind clouds low enough in the sky that my view became obscured by light pollution and I lost sight of it.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,49.24709033771107,-122.97921566604128

The event was less than a minute. I could not see it as it traveled further south due to the 2-story building in from of my apartment.

There were only two visible stars (probably because of NYC light pollution, and because there was a bright security floodlight on a rooftop corner off to the left), and they were smaller, dimmer, unchanging, and not flickering. As I watched, I did see a much smaller blinking red light moving slowly in the sky toward the right edge and then out of my visual field, which looked like normal airplane activity—the contrast between this light and the brighter, larger stationary one served to affirm the uniqueness of the latter. I got my phone and recorded the light for about 45 seconds, unfortunately without raising the window screen because doing so is very noisy. I called my husband to the window (he is skeptical about th! is kind of thing) and asked him what he saw. He described what I described and said that the fact that the lighted object was stationary—not requiring propulsion to stay aloft, and clearly “spinning”—he couldn’t understand what it could possibly be.

She went into the other window near the bathroom I was in and then seen the light zigzagging near a light pole near our place. She yelled for me to come look but I was peeing but stopped myself to go look as quick as I could. I was about 2 steps away from the window before she said it vanished. She thought it was possibly police or someone with a flashlight but we went outside immediately after her sighting and there was nobody outside. I tried to recreate it with a few different flashlights but the light wasn’t solid and you could only see the beam. I’m not skeptical but if I don’t see something firsthand then I suggest more scientific explanations first so I also suggested it being a drone but a drone wouldn’t just vanish and it’s not like she seen it in the sky.. it was approximately 200 feet off the ground. My second thought was ball lighting but ! it wasn’t lighting or even raining and she said the shape was like a oval.. she also said it was similar size to a circular sled.,2020-12-23T00:00:00,37.8652,-81.1968

At approx. 4:40 AM @ Pine Tree Rd/A1A a ""Sputnik""-shaped golden entity arose from the road and quickly rose vertically into the sky. This happened as my car (the only one upon the road at the time) approached it. Furthermore, the being appeared to have ""unfolded"" from a resting position upon the road as opposed to a mechanical device. There was no sense of endangerment or radiation from the surrounding environment.

It was dark. But I was in the shower when my family started freaking out about a loud noise and something white and red outside flying around behind our house going back and forth. I went to the window facing my back yard in my parents room. Behind our house is a 160ish acre field and next to it is maybe twice or three times as much worth of woods. It appeared to be a mile or so far away when I first saw it. Then just like that it was right in my backyard woods. Maybe 70 to 100 yards away and it was gliding towards my house getting closer and closer and then it stopped. Then it turned right as in my right so that would be it's left and glided in that direction. That's when I was able to to make out its long cylinder like shape but the ends were rounded off like the top an egg on each side. Both ends had one light at this time and it was a dim light. Not bright white like LEDs. It was like older headlights on a car. It had to be the size and length of a schoo! l bus maybe bigger. We have ducks and chickens and a fair amount of people have dogs on our street and nearby. They all started freaking out and making noises. The UFO had a hovering noise that sounded like a lasso spinning in the air like the wild west movies. The UFO just glided over the trees like it was searching for something and soon the lights disappeared. I went outside to investigate and walked up to the treeline and I sat there for a minute watching and listening and my mom was begging me to come inside. Right when she started asking me to come inside I just heard was seemed to be multiple animals or people sprinting through the woods. I couldnt see anything but tons of sticks were cracking and you could hear leaves and whatever else on the forest floor being stepped on as all these things were moving quickly through the woods. It was honestly unlike anything ive ever seen in my life. And right now I honestly feel like its still out there doing something. In the m! orning I'm going out to look in the area it was hovering. This! was def initely not a drone. The hovering noise it made was too loud and the UFO was too big. If you saw this thing youd know something was very wrong here. About 4 years ago my sister described waking up in the middle of the night to something exactly like this and it makes me wonder why I never listened to her. There was definitely something out there and it was not from this planet. I swear I'm not making this up.,2020-12-23T00:00:00,43.0687,-70.9517

However, as I continued upon my route the object I noticed it was moving in atypical aviation patterns. I am closely familiar with aviation capabilities (known) and come from a line of pilots and military personnel. This was different from anything I had ever seen. It seemed to change altitude effortlessly with no    Trail or heat byproduct behind it. I observed it flying at an FL of  7-10 feet.. It appeared bright white throughout and had a longer body than width an almost looked like cigar with more rounded edges. I did manage to take a short video and 2 photos. The stability of the video is shaky from driving but clear.

Due to an owl whooting outside and my adult children wanting to hear it as well, we were standing on my front deck. Everyone was being very still and quiet, and actually paying attention for a change. I was admiring the beautiful clear night sky, which was clear and star filled, I  noticed a blinking light, I knew that we are passing thru the Hailey's Comet debris and I thought oh look maybe I can show my family a ""shooting star"". After watching the ""Star/Meteor/Debris"",it dawned on me that it shouldn't be taking this long for it to start to streak thru the sky, and why would it be colored, red wait now its blue. After repeatedly blinking and rubbing my eyes numerous times, and actually seeing it turn a long range of colors,  from red to blue, purplish,  yellow, golden, then a very bright glowing white. I asked my family, whom ! we range in age from 14 years to 48 years old, hey do you all see this to? I then pointed to what I was seeing, unanimous yes's from all. We all watched as it went completely across our field of vision, which thankfully we have a large area that is cleared of anything that could possibly inhibit our line of sight. I would give an absolutely 100% time frame, but I was so stunned by what I was seeing, that I stood there dumbfounded, for several minutes and then we all stood there and discussed what we had seen. I know the exact time of when I got home, due to being a business owner, I have to keep track of all my travel information for income taxes. One other interesting thing about this, my mother, who lives about 6 acres away from us, called me the next morning and asked me had I heard the loud booming sound last night, which none of us heard anything. Not sure if that has anything at all to do with this, but it was around the same time. I do know that we 100% saw something, I am a skeptical person,  and have never believed in Aliens or Unidentified Flying objects, but  I know that we saw a round/oval object that flashed at least 6 different colors or variations of those colors and flew above my family for at least 3 to 5 minutes at speeds that I have never seen or heard of before. One other interesting thing,  after reading several other reports from others, I  developed an intense throbbing headache,  which has not gone away since I witnessed the object, now it has been 4 days. I have taken Aleve, Advil, Tylenol pretty much anything that has ever worked before and it will not go away. All of the 5 of us, had a weird ""taste/smell"", like when you get an IV and you sense the salinity thru your nose or taste buds, its like a very faint miles away skunky smell that also had a metallic taste. Also, several family members have also had other symptoms that are unusual, my 21 year old son can't sleep at all, he is usually a heavy sleeper that could sleep anywhere really. My 14 year old has the funky smell/ taste thing like I do as well as the splitting headache. My husband who is usually quiet has become a very irritable person,  who has a short temper and wants to argue with just about anyone or thing. So with all this, I'm still not sure what the hell we saw that night!",2020-12-23T00:00:00,35.4597,-82.8677

It was aware, and it looked as if it noticed me and came down.  It had an orange light and white lights, combined. It was well hidden, because when it went back up, after I ran for my life. I showed my neighbors, who said it was an airplane. I said no it came down to my face. It was a circle type of object, but hard to see with the bright lights.  After I collected myself and went back outside. There were 2 of them. Hanging out here for about an hour.  It came down to me again, a couple of times. I was terrified. And I wish I wasn't.  But the ending was when it got very strange. When they left, for good.  I had a couple neighbors outside. And it came at me one last time. But this time, it was the shape of! a real airplane.

I would like to be able to find out if there was any traffic above my complex. I took a couple pictures of it. But, again, it really doesn't do any good, because it looks like a craft in the air.

As I was in my backyard I was looking up at the stars setting up my camera (which unfortunately didn’t capture it), and out of nowhere I see three bright dots, slightly less bright than mars, in the formation of a triangle. To be specific, it was an isosceles triangle shape. I was able to follow this triangle with eyes for about 1 second, maybe 2, and then it kept flying out of my view. To be clear, at no point did I see it vanish, it just kept flying and from where I was, I was unable to keep seeing it due to my house’s roof being in the way. It was moving Northwest and at no point turned or rotated. I believe the angle would be 180 degrees, since it was moving practically in a straight Northwest line from where I first saw it, to where I last saw it.  If it helps in any way, at around 11:20PM, the location where I first saw this object was fairly close to the positioning of mars at that time. (Not exact, but close to it). The position of Mars was to my Southwest. Overall, this was a perfect triangle formation, moving at an incredibly fast speed, and producing no noise whatsoever.

I was sitting on my front steps on the south west side of west mountain in South West Vermont, Bennington County. Looking out to the west where the sun sets I saw what I thought was a satellite. I then saw another light and another, behind the empty trees. I moved to see past the trees and I saw it. First I though ""OH! thats starlink satellites."" This was quickly dropped as I saw the front and end of the craft. It was almost like aerogel. Kinda transparent. It was like the moon and the sun was just right to refract light through it or I would have only seen the line of lights. It looked like a pipe fish from the deep sea. It had what looked like a hollow in tube front and a slender tail. I could not get it on camera, I only caught a tiny light of it. I immediately went inside to find starlink in the sky. It was not any where near me. No satellite or other craft was in the area at the time. It was 1000% a cigar shaped UFO. I have seen things that I ! could have excused, but was too strange to conclude. Not this one. Not even slightly. I am so certain that this is EXACTLY what others have been seeing as it was one of the first pictures I found when searching for the UFO. I am not very versed in what they look like in pictures or reports. It made the fact that I saw a CLEAR picture some one else took of a similar craft, that much more confident I was seeing a UFO. It had the exact same hollow tube nose and slender tail with the same lights. What bothers me the most, I got distracted from the subject within 5 minuets. The next day I was thinking about that and  had a thought""... did I see one before?"" I might have. Living in Long island NY early 2000's I was coming home late around 10 or 11. I saw 3 lights in a triangle formation. First stars I thought, but moving, so no. Next I thought plane. Nope! No flashes and size getting bigger. Eventually it was directly over head. It took up the entire sky and flew comple! tely silent. I could not see through it. It blocked out the st! ars abov e my head and I knew at that point it was a solid craft. So I say maybe because as clear as this memory is, it does not feel like mine. No matter how much I go over it in my head I feel like its not my story. I did not remember this until I thought about forgetting the NEW UFO I am reporting here. Why did this not take over my life? Why is the shock value so diminished so soon? What is that? I know for a fact what I have seen this time. The cigar shape will be burned into my mind forever... I assume. The triangle craft, I will never know if that was a real memory or not, and that hurts my foundation of reality as I usually have an amazing grounding even in things I forget. It has a certain feeling of right or wrong and this one wont fit that. It's stuck in the middle like it was another persons story that you adopted some how. So strange. In summary, I saw 1 cigar shaped UFO with a front tubular looking end, and a slender tail. It was moving across the sky from north to south. I saw the ship sideways looking from the east to the west. It had a translucent body, like a deep see pipe fish with luminescent dots on its side. It was also reminiscent of translucent blue aerogel. It moved slowly and consistently. Lights where ?star yellow? no blue or red or flashing of any kind. Time was 7:28pm on October 24th year 2020.  I have no special credentials to give me any credibility. I will say this, I am rational and look to be skeptical in an objective observational sense. I would still accept information to prove or disprove what I have seen. It is very hard to dismiss ones own eyes when a simple search brought up a clear photograph of what one has seen. The craft was almost 100% identical to a famous picture I have seen that was taken by George Adamski. The only missing bit was the more tapered tail, but that could h! ave been formed in the edge of the atmosphere? Like a comet tail? Maybe one day we will all know. Until then, Im gonna keep looking up!",2020-12-23T00:00:00,42.8626,-73.0998

Turning east onto  FM 2231 W, we were curious about the lights we had just witnessed and parked at the intersection of FM 2231 W and County Road 229 to watch the southern sky from a small hilltop. A few moments later a brilliant red light with a faint yellow tinge, round in shape, popped on a couple miles south at about the same altitude as the two lights seen a couple mile west. This intense red, singular light, sat stationary as another red light ! popped on to it's southwest another mile or so behind the first. Then a third popped on in the distant south maybe 5 or so miles back, difficult to estimate. In all there were about four separate lights. They were silent. They never made a formation, changing locations seemingly randomly. They would burn intensely for only a few seconds before winking out and popping on a mile or so away in an instant. Occasionally one of them would wink off but stay in it's place while flickering a very tiny faint white light before popping on again. This continued until they were hardly noticeable in the distance near to Cisco Texas. I was commenting on the unusual lack of air traffic over our area when we noticed the lights coming back our way. In three or four winks they had traveled back to FM 2231 W. All this taking place west of and parallel to Highway 183 S.

I was taking a doctoral course two nights a week at Baylor University from 7:00 to 8:30 PM.  As I was coming home from the class earlier in the week, I noticed a  low bright light over Lake Waco.  At first I thought it was the planet Venus. but as I approached the lake, the source of the light was more and more to my right, yet stationary. So, I knew it wasn't star or a planet.  I figured it was a helicopter.  But two nights later as I was returning home, I saw the same thing; so I decided to investigate. As I crossed the bridge spanning Lake Waco, I could see the bright light just above Speegleville Park which lies on the west side of the lake. I took the first exit and went down what was then a dirt road that led to the park.  As I got closer, the object started moving west about 100-150 feet in the air with its light off.  It was a clear night and light enough for me to be see the shadow of its outline. Then the craft which made no sound turned south and went over the highway and remained stationary in the air on the south side of the highway.  I got back on the highway and proceeded west until I could take the next exit and turned left on the overpass where I saw the craft cross the highway. As I did, the craft started moving south, again, and settled behind a clump of trees. I crept past the trees but could not see it.   The narrow road curved slightly back to the southeast; so I went about 100 yards. pulled over and turned off my lights but left the engine running. Looking in my rear view mirror, I watched for a few minutes and then saw the craft slowly rise from beyond the trees and come towards me just on the other side of the fence to my right.  When it was parallel to my vehicle, it turned facing me motionless about 35 feet in the air, making no sound.  There was a small telephone or electric line pole to the left of the craft by the fence which gave me a indication of its altitude. I observed the craft to be triangular, black in color, about 30 feet long and about 20 feet wide at the rear.  It had a small cockpit toward the front and there was a green hue inside.  I then noticed three, small round heads peering down at me.  I hadn't been there five minutes when the craft shined a green light toward me.  It was then my engine died and I couldn't restart it. I tried to turn on the lights and the radio; but they didn't work neither.  This bothered me, and I started to get nervous; so I locked my doors. We sat motionless, the craft and for about another 15 minutes (but seemed much longer) with me trying every few minutes to restart my engine to no avail. In all, I guessed I had been there about 20-25 minutes.  Finally, my engine started and I took off with no lights on.  After traveling southeast for about 75 yards, I turned my lights on and did a U-turn.  As I passed the craft on my left, it made no attempt to follow me.  When I got back on the highway and headed east, I looked to the right and could see it was still there. As the AF Colonel in an England forest in 1980 once said, ""Weird.""  (By the way, fifteen years earlier, I had two years of training with the Air Force in the identification of aircraft.  Plus, I had two years of Top Secret Clearance with the U.S. Army afterwards.  The craft that I encountered in 1973 was nothing that I could compare it with.  So, I concluded it was a UFO, possibly, of alien origin.)",2020-02-07T00:00:00,31.57359750778816,-97.13584859813085

UFO SIGHTING, EARLY 1970’S ATHENS, TWP, PA, WOLCOTT HOLLOW ROAD   This take place in the early 1970’s while I was at my grandparents’ home on Wolcott Hollo Road, in Athens Township PA.  These were my stepfather’s parents.  Their names were XXXX and XXXXXXX MXXXXX. It was mid-summer, and I was walking up the hill, (a pasture) across from the house.  I was with my Uncle Jim, my stepfathers’ younger brother.  While walking up the hill, something caught our attention, causing us to turn around. When we did, we had a perfect clear view of what we were seeing, as it was very low, only about 50 to 75 ft off the ground.  As it went over the house, I thought I could have thrown a ball and hit it, as it was that close. What we were seeing was a shiny silver aircraft with the US Air Force symbol on the side.  The props were not turning and I don't believe the engines were running.  On both sides of the plane and to the front and rear of the Aircraft, were round disk.  Above the plane, was a single disk. Also, there seemed to be a shimmer, something like what you see when you see the heat rising from a hot road.  That’s what it looked like between the disk and the aircraft. There was no sound whatsoever, and they were moving very slow. There was, still is, a hilltop on either side of the area. So, it’s like they were going below the hill tops, following the valley they made. At the time, I only knew it as a shiny silver plane, it was later that I knew it was a B 17. At the time we seen this, my uncle was visibly nervous. He told me to never say anything about what we had seen.  He told me that if I did, something bad could happen.  So, I never said anything to anyone, except my wife years later. I am now 56 years old, a combat veteran, and I have seen other things I have kept quiet about.

The night before Thanksgiving & Thanksgiving Day, 11/21/79 & 11/22/79, Hollister, CA. out in the country, but not too far away from downtown Hollister.  The night of 11/21/79 I went to my car to get my suitcase.  I set it on the ground, looked up and saw two lights about 20 feet off the ground, spaced apart about the distance of headlights.  They were a bright, illuminated golden color. I'd never seen that color of light before, very bright but not glaring.  They were on top of a light blue column of light. A vibration went though me.  I knew they weren't from here. It was completely silent.  I sidled around the front of my car, keeping my eyes on the lights and went into a building to get my friend.  We both stood shoulder to shoulder looking at these bright, golden lights and the light blue column of light underneath them.  After awhile, the lights started to get brighter and brighter. My friend left to get her brother.  I stood watching the lights as they became brighter.  When they were becoming too bright, I went to turn my head. The lights flashed brighter into my eyes before my head turned.  I went to get my friends. When the four of us came back out, seconds later, the lights were gone.  We stood there looking around and couldn't see anything.  Then I heard the smoothest, quietest engine I had ever heard and it was close by to us.  I asked my friend if she could hear the engine and she said yes. We couldn't see anything.  After a little while longer, I looked up at the sky and saw a huge, silent equilateral triangle flying overhead.  I could see the lights in the vertices, not an aircraft. As we watched it fly silently along, a huge beam of light was turned on in the direction they were flying.  We watched it fly out of sight. When it flew out of sight, my friends started talking about a strange, red light in the center of the triangle of lights. They said it had a strange optical effect. I didn't see the red light. All I saw was the huge magnificent triangle created by the 3 vertex lights. I wondered if the reason I couldn't see the red light in the center was because the ""headlight orbs"" had flashed the lights into my eyes before I turned my head. The next day, Thanksgiving, I went to the back of the building to use the toilet. The buildings had been a poultry farm years earlier. My boyfriend converted one of them into an antique furniture restoration business.There were missing boards on the side of the building where he had put in a toilet. I was sitting on the toilet peeing, looking out through the missing board spaces towards the front area of two parallel buildings. A 7.5-8.5 tall, red colored skin, human type male ET walked into the space between the two building with his back towards me. He came from the direction of the other building. I couldn't see the front of the other building. He circled around with his back towards me, motioning his right arm up and down on his side and moved out of my sight. It was the motion people use to get someone's attention. Seconds later he came into the open area between the two building again. He had his back towards me, motioned his right arm up and down on his right side and! circled back around out of my sight. He had a very elongated torso and very long arms. His upper back and shoulders were very broad and really strong looking. He was really big, fit and strong! I didn't any hair on his head. I didn't see any pants, but I didn't see his butt either. What really stood out was how elongated his torso and arms were, and how broad and strong his upper back was. The red color of his skin also stood out. It was the color of red that a very overheated, or very sunburned white person would have. I asked everyone in the vicinity if they had seen him or knew anyone who could fit his description. No one else saw him or knew anyone who looked like him. I had never seen anyone with his type of physique or skin color before that day, and have never seen anyone who looks like him since then. I have been questioned as to why he would have his back towards me. If he had been standing there watching me pee, I would have considered that intrusive. Walking into the space between the two buildings with his back towards me, gave me an opportunity to get a general impression of body type and skin color. I don't know if the skin color was actual or caused by other reasons. Plus, it was a jaw dropping experience seeing him. Coming back out into the open space a 2nd time gave me the chance to confirm to myself, yes, I did see him. His arm motioning was what humans do to get someone's attention. The night we saw the ""headlight orbs"" and the triangle I didn't feel afraid. It wasn't eerie. It was calm. I felt akin, meaning somehow we were related.. I had never had the experience of feeling akin and that was before I saw the ET. .I sensed a living presence and it wasn't alien. It wasn't from this world though! I also felt that night that they are my parents.. That also was before I saw the ET. I knew ""they"" weren't my earth parents. I did however have a strong feeling that I was related somehow - maybe a parent race or related because we are both human types. When I saw him the next day, it confirmed my sense of, ""akin or a kin.""  I was an Art student at U.C. Davis, CA at the time. I went down to Hollister, CA to spend Thanksgiving vacation with my boyfriend. I had an interesting related coincidence years later. I was an administrative assistant at U.C. Davis working in the Department of Natural Resources. .I was given a form to type up. The former poultry farm where I had the UFO and ET experience was up for sale. The U.C. Davis Dept. of Natural Resources was considering purchasing it and was ordering an inspection done of the property. I got a different job and didn't followup on what was in the inspection or if they purchased the property. I read on your site that the large triangle craft was sighted flying over Austin, TX, six days before our sighting in Hollister, CA.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,36.8952,-121.2434

There was a scattered layer of clouds, I verified at 12,000’ from the SJO airport METAR. The object was under the layer of clouds, I’m guessing 11,000’.

But the lights maintained static brightness even when passing under an area without clouds. It moved flawlessly on track, with no variation. It wasn’t a projection from the ground.

After a few minutes of watching the object it suddenly lit up from its interior,  the entire object a bright yellowish- white glowing light.  In that same instant it suddenly stopped moving and, faster than we could visually register, it went straight into space and disappeared.  I’ll repeat again,  it stopped its chaotic movements, froze in place, lit up and instantly ascended in a straight line into the dark sky above us.

My father told me after this event that it is not appropriate to talk about things like this.  My father and I walked out of the front door and turned left and walked down the front stairs. It was dark outside. I noticed or sensed something in the sky.  I turned and looked up.  From behind us I saw a very large triangular shaped craft with lights (I believe green and yellow).  It was completely silent and very low to the ground.  I told my dad to look and pointed.  He turned around and almost pushed me to the ground he was so caught off guard.  We both stopped on the way to the car and watched it hover over us.  It never made a sound.  It was moving very slowly.  I remember it seemed to defy gravity by keeping its elevation while moving so slow.  I had never seen anything in my life like it.  My father dismissed it as military for years.  Once the stealth aircraft came out he seemed to make sense of it in! that way for himself. We haven't spoke about this in decades. I was never convinced that what we saw was military.  I will never forget that moment.  I wish I was old enough to record the specific date and time along with other information about that experience.,2020-02-07T00:00:00,38.5241,-82.6935

At my young age of 7 years old, I had no idea what UFOs even were nor did I care.  As a normal child would, I looked up at the sky and the environment around me as I was riding in the backseat of my father's car as he was driving on the quiet open roads. It was a peaceful sunny day and nothing seemed out of place. As I looked up once again to see the clear blue skies, I saw a light that at first glance looked like a a small moon emitting light from itself like a soft glow. The oval aircraft did not emit light from just one part of the aircraft but looked like it was made of light itself, as the sun would shine, although it was clearly a lot less brighter than the sun. Then I realized it was moving so I believed it must be an aircraft. The moment I realized that it was not a normal aircraft was the way it was moving. T! he oval shaped aircraft started moving erratically from left to right in speeds and angles that would be impossible for a normal or any existing aircraft so I alerted my father who was driving and told him, ""look there is a funny airplane in the air."" He glanced at the aircraft and he did not know what it was. I kept watching the aircraft and it would move left and right almost instantaneously in distances that would be utterly impossible with any object. Even as a child I knew how airplanes moved in the sky and knew all airplanes moved linear. More intriguingly, after moving bizarrely at incredible speeds, the aircraft disappeared as fast as it had appeared. To this day, I have no explanation for what I had seen but I know for certain that it had been a unidentified flying object. Whether this was a military test aircraft or an alien spacecraft, I can never know but I will always know that what I saw was not a normal aircraft and I am certain there are things tha! t are supernatural or far beyond our technology as we know it.! Upon fu rther investigation on this childhood experience, I have learned that the state of Indiana had military aircraft stations near Lafayette and many others who have experienced the same UFO experience around the same time that I did, as with the more notorious military aircraft bases like the Area 51.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,40.47188798283262,-86.95358927038627

This is normal for this area.  When I look up I see something, a craft shaped like a dollar bill.  This shape is similar to Northrop Tacit Blue, but at this point things are different.  At midpoint on each side of the fuselage there appears to be wings, they are too short and straight out from body of craft to be of little use.  There is also no tail structure, is completely missing on the craft.  Finally there is what looks like some kind of exhaust port on end of craft. Also craft wasn’t too thick in cross section.

Sighting took place on Monday 11/2/20 on the island of Maui. It was my last night there and I was swimming while watching the sunset on Kanapali beach right next to Black Rock.  Looking west across the ocean towards the setting sun, the island of Lanai is directly across the water. There were some clouds sort of sitting there right at Lanai’s peak but the rest of the sky was totally clear minus some very light stratus clouds.  For the last roughly 20 minutes of the sunset, before the sun crossed the horizon line, the sun itself was blocked from my point of view. by the island of lanai, leaving a beautiful palate of colors in the sky. It was during this time, after the sun had passed behind Lanai but before completely setting that I had my sighting.  Looking out at sky above and around Lanai (from the water right next to Black Rock on Kanapali Beach), just to the right of the island, I saw some solid, completely motionless object. It’s hard to estimate altitude and distance but I would say it was roughly a 30 degree angle from my vantage point and roughly about as high up as Lanai if not slightly lower and if I pointed one hand directly to the north edge of Lanai and my other hand directly at the object they would be roughly 2 feet apart (hope that makes sense)  Whatever was in the sky was glowing and resembled the sun reflecting off a big sheet of gold or copper in the sky, but the sun was setting behind it, so I don’t see how from my POV it could have been any kind of reflection. It’s also hard to estimate the shape of the object, although it kind of looked like a soda can or something (the light coming off of it and distance made it really hard to judge the shape, just what comes to mind).  I observed it sitting completely still for et least 45 seconds and then it just dissapeared or phased out. It didn’t shoot off, it was just there one second and then gone the next, leaving nothing but clear sky behind.  ***foot note. I have no idea if this is relevant or not but a few nights before I went to the top of Haleakala by myself at about 1 am and spent about 3 hours up there totally alone without seeing another person or car the whole time. It was an almost full moon so there weren’t a lot of stars but I thought I would try at least what I remembered to be the basics of Steven Greere’s CE-5 protocols. Meditated on and off for a good hour, tried to put a lot of intention into it and aside from a couple shooting stars, didn’t see anything.  On the night of my sighting, as the sun was setting and I started to see some stars I toyed with the idea again, but only tried to put my “intention” out for about 60 seconds or so... didn’t even really mediate, but about 10 minutes later is when I had my sighting. This probably had nothing to do with it, but thought it was worth mentioning",2020-12-23T00:00:00,,

He mentioned that it could have been some kind of government military experiments. I said ""I don't think so"".  We continued down the road and there was a makeshift checkpoint in which some military guys asked us questions about what was in our van, but it seemed strange to be checking for fruits or plants at 3:30 AM.

I was with my neighbors outside we were talking after work sharing a six pack amongst 5 people the first time.  And 4 of the same people the next year.  We all witnessed the same thing .  4 out of the 5 of us seen in two years in a row . Our first response to each other was that ""NOOONE WILL BELIEVE US! ""  I was in same location as the previous year.  I witnessed something that was the first time terrfying . And the following year. SAME exact phenomenon!  Close to the same day or most likley the same day .  Two years in a row.  As if it was scheduled flight.  SO I WITNESSED amongst five other witnesses A bright glowing silent circle in the sky above .  The first year only noticed it because of a huge flash of light . The nighttime tunred to daylight. For almost a minute .  We all looked at each other not making sense of it .  Until we eventually looked at thr sky .  We seen , whatever it was fly away at hypersonic speed creating what i would call a tear in the sky itself .  It left a sort of a con trail across the clear black sky . Only the trajectory went upwards.  Towards the stars . Not east to west.  Or north to south . It has an axis of flight that didnt make sense. Its accelerations was 0mph to hypersonic in a blink of an eye .  And a red tear in the stratosphere was all that remained after it flew off  .  And was entirely silent . What alerted us all.  The second year .   the same exact day .  We were in the same location the same light happened.  But this time we knew to look up.  All of the exact same things occured . In thr same order . Left the same tear in the atmosphere .  Only this time because we seen it before we seen the object.. and not just the dissapearqnce of an unknown object as was thr case the year before .  It was a silent circle craft. Seemed to be almost invisible . You could see through it . But not entirely . The size was impossible to tell because of thr ""cloaking i would say ""  and once one of us noticed . Pointed.  The light again happened.  Lit up the street and sky as if a electrical transformer blew up. Electrical light bluish in color . Almost like cloud lightning . Than zips away again the second time.staight up. Than changed direction heading south east .  Note . Naval weapons station earl is a 15 minute drive by car from me .  I do not know what the hell all of us witnessed. But it was powerful. It was something that cannot be properly described . The light that lit up the night was so powerful . And the way it moved at hypersonic speeds and switched directions. In a blinknof an eye it moved so far it was over the horizon..  We have all witnessed meteor showers . We have witnesssed transformers blowing up nearby . The first year we thought and tried convinving ourselves thats what had happened and we had seen . But the second year . On the same date . At the same time . And the same people witnessing this thing . It scares me .  I hope it belongs to the U.S. because it has more power in that vehicle than Anything i have ever seen on earth.   To all reading this . I am a skeptic little green men . Like i said before. I live next to naval weapons station Earl . 15 minutes away by car . Since this occurance its an obsession with me to figure out what my own senses  showed me and my friends . Two years in a row . I dont believe aliens use our calenders or watches . So i believe its a military object . I just cannot imagine that we are that advanced yet . Must have craft 200 years more advanced than the public recognizes.  Or maybe not .

In trying to judge how high it was flying, I can compare against the backdrop of skyscrapers I see southeast from my location, and it appeared to be flying at perhaps the height of a helicopter (there was also a great deal of helicopter action in the sky last night due to the election).  I was also able to make out in that brief moment that it was an elongated, oval or egg-like shape, which also suggested it wasn't flying terribly high.  Additionally, I saw it pass in front of my view of several of the skyscrapers of downtown Chicago, which are between 1-2 miles south of me. The object itself was egg-shaped from the brief glimps! e I got, and it glowed. There were no distinguishable individual lights on it, and nothing blinking.  A very large tail of light followed behind it, perhaps due to speed. The light was bright, but not blinding. It moved in a gently arced, horizontal line, not straight across the sky.

What was I doing at the time?  Picking up a friend from work with a car full of people (5 people) I was sitting in the (back seat in between my friends.  Which made me the last to see what my friends started yelling out “UFO it’s a UFO”!  I didn’t see it until I demanded the driver to pull over so I can get out and see what the fuzz was about.  ASI got out of the car and began to look up at the sky I saw it.  It was almost Orange but like the color of a street light. And the light looked as if it had a light on it.  (Not like a light that shines out of it) like nothing I've ever seen the craft was a cross shaped craft with the nose and tale shape shifting. What was it doing when I saw it: Flight normal or a minute but it clearly was not a plane as you could see the angles of the arms of the cross perfectly.  Yet the nose and tale would change for being squared to rounded off.  This was a cross like the one Jesus is on with the head as the nose and the tail as the feet. (Laying down not standing up) then it started moving in a  way I can’t explain.  Until finally turning into a orb after flying in some weird pattern back into space” The first person to see it was the passenger seat (guy getting of work) he explains how it first caught his eye. “It was a star like object that began to get brighter until forming into what I saw and explained. WHY AM I REPORTING THIS NOW. Because I can’t go a night without looking up in the sky and wondering what it was that I saw. I reported it back then and saw one other report of the same thing which I mentioned. End note. I’m am forever changed by this event. Nothing was said on local news and very little was I able to find about it. I got no pictures cause I had no cell phone at the time. Know I’m seeing more and more about this craft. I’ve read so far that Area 51 has a plane supposedly cross shaped and it was still being learned about by the people at Area 51. I’m not saying what I saw was this craft but from what I gathered from the report it does sound the same. I’ve never seen anything in my life shape shift so I am still curious about it being man made. Cross ufo are on the rise I believe it could aliens or our government agencies experimenting with learn about this technology. I’m not at all surprised to say reports about cross ufos are almost all the same description to the tee most of the time.   Was it the sign of the cross cause looking back a the ufo battle in ancient pictures you can see a iron cross type craft in the battle above the skies they described. Please contact me if y! our interested as I can’t get this out of my mind to this very day,2020-02-07T00:00:00,,

At about 3 am, I came out of the guard house located at the end of the runway next to Le Jeune Road (42nd Ave) in order to stretch my legs.  At that moment I looked up to the sky and noticed that there was an unusually dense and low clowd cover.  The clowds were moving northbound fairly quick as it was very windy.  Then all of a sudden, I saw this huge yellow fireball with a long tail, silently traveling horizontally in the opposite direction of the clouds where it disappeared in a matter of seconds.  I was flabbergasted not only by the nature of the sighting but of how close to the ground the fireball was.  It couldn't have been much higher than the planes when taking off or landing at the runway.

We went there specifically to view the pupfish.  I'm a geologist and biologist/naturalist instructor which makes me very curious so we decided to hike up a Canyon directly east of Devils hole.  We parked our black tacoma near the mouth of this canyon and started hiking east up the Canyon.  One mile in the walls got higher and the Canyon narrower.  We stopped to listen because we both could hear a faint droning sound.  This was a very unusual noise which we had never experienced before or since.  It held us spellbound as the sound was coming down the Canyon but the Canyon had many bends and curves so we couldn't see what object was generating the noise.  Then it came around a tight curve in the Canyon 300 yards in front of us and was a black equilateral triangle shaped object.  It was flying very low staying below the rim of the canyon (100' above the! ground)  I estimate it was 100 to 120 feet on a side.  It saw us and made a 90° turn.  As it turned I distinctly observed two inward angles canards on one side of the ufo.  The droning humming sound vanished as it shot off north right through a low saddle in the Canyon wall.  The lack of noise after it saw us and flashed off to the north leads me to believe it had two sources or kinds of propulsion.  I checked google maps and we were approximately between 30 - 40 miles west from Area 51 and area 52.  For several years we never told anyone because frankly we didn't believe anyone would believe us.  I searched the web frequently looking for similar photos.  Finally someone posted a video over Paris, France, of the exact black triangle ufo we witnessed flying east of devils hole in March of 2015.  This sighting was about 2:00 in the afternoon under crystal clear skys with no wind.  I'm 99.99999999 % convinced this is United States technology as it appeared to have flown from area 51 and its return flight path was in that same direction.  I have r! ead a lo t of speculation and comments on whose technology this is on the internet but this sighting to me is empirical data that it is indeed US technology behind this ufo.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,,

I lived near an airport for a couple of years.  Planes and helicopters were something I was used to, and I had come to learn the flight patterns and pathways, how each craft looked, what lights it displayed, how it traveled, etc. At IAH the planes never come from the West, as they only enter and exit going North or South, with a quick, sharp turn here or there.  And you could always hear them since we lived right across from the airport.  The planes took off straight over the apartment (could feel the walls vibrate sometimes).  That’s how I knew this was something strange. After dinner one evening, I let my dog outside to do her business.  I was standing out there watching her, when I looked in the sky and saw a floating, white orb on the West side (almost directly across from me), above the treetops.  It almost looked like a star, but was too big, too bright, and too close to convince me of such.  It had a shine to it like a diamond.  It was NOT solid white, and the “shine” would get brighter and then dim back down. If I had to guess, it wasn’t but a few miles from me.  There was no sound, and it wasn’t stationary.  It very slowly travelled left to right to left to right again.  The object also staggered in movement, and moved up and down as well.  Which then convinced me this was no star or planet, since the Earth travels in a directional orbit.  Aside from that point, even during the clearest weather, it’s extremely difficult to see stars when you live in the city, especially in a city as big as Houston. This sighting lasted for about 15 minutes until I got a strange feeling that I was being watched.  I became so weirded out that I went back inside.  I later (don’t remember what time) mustered up the courage to go back outside, and the orb was gone.  But there was now a helicopter (with an obvious red-blinking light on the tail) looking around the same area with a spotlight. It circled around the area several times, moving its spotlight around, as if searching for something. I have never seen anything like it since then.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

I noticed something moving across the sky.  It was crescent shaped, dim, and about 5"" across.  It moved across about 45 degrees of sky in 10 to 20 seconds in a northwest direction.  It did not change shape or brightness.  I tried to surmise whether it was something low and hovering (a drone or maybe a group of birds moving pretty quick) or higher and moving very quickly. I thought perhaps I wasn't seeing it clearly at first but after a few seconds I could see a clear cresent shape.  The lighting on it did not change in a way I would expect if it was low.  I decided it was probably a bow shock catching the sun (now set)'s light like a noctilucent cloud.  However I am unfamiliar with what produces such long lived and steadily moving bowshock.  I did not see that there were any vandenburg launches when I looked after.  One other odd note: as I was watching it a meteor passed through it (diagonally vaguely ENE and at a very different soured of course so I assumed it was unrelated).

I shut the door and exclaimed to my brother that the stars I’d seen and photographed were gone. He wanted proof so I opened the door to take another photo and they were back!

The park is located two miles northwest of the town of Currie in Murray County.  Park is located where in August of 1862 massacre of settlers took place during the US Dakota War. Observation of unidentified object took place while I was lying on my cot looking up at the constellation Cygnus. As I was looking up at Cygnus two meteors shot across the constellation traveling north to south.  One of the meteors trailed closely behind the other. Both had the magnitude in brightness as currently does the star Deneb.  There was a slight variation in the direction as one took a straight southerly route and the other a slight shift to the South South East.  As a comparison they were separated in distance by using an out stretched arm and looking at the small finger. At this point to me they appeared as meteors until the lead object rapidly decelerated and stop.  When it stopped in the central west area of Cygnus the object dimmed in magnitude.  Then slowing it began moving west or at a right angle from its previous direction.  At this point I took notice wondering what had just happened.  As it traveled past several stars it again stopped.  At this point I called a friend by phone to discuss what was taking place.  Again the object stopped and after a brief interlude changed direction and started slowing moving south towards the constellation Delphinus.  Shortly thereafter it drifted out of view.

I saw an object moving left to right, seemingly in a straight line moving diagonally away from me.  A couple of minutes later, I realized the object had stopped, just stopped.  I continued to watch it, thinking maybe its just moving away from me, but it stayed in one place for about 10 minutes.  I got my binoculars, and took a look, and the object, which seemed from a distance to be LED bright, and with multiple lights, turned out to be a moving snake line, like an electrical impulse kind of thing you would see on a computer screensaver.  A snake like line just kept moving randomly but in a contained space.  I saw no distinguishing shape.  I thought maybe it was some kind of refracted light from the binocular lens, so I checked out other stars, but they were not moving, and had no such squiggly lines or brightness.  Then I noticed that there were a couple more really bright lights, and looked closer with the binoculars, noting that there were three such lights, each with these electrical impulse type snake movements like a line chasing its tail kind of thing.  I realized that together, the 3 lights formed a very large triangle, although I saw no shape between them, and they did not move.  This was over the Niagara River in Lewiston, New York, which borders with Canada, and because of the distance (the lights were not close), I couldn’t determine if they were over the river or over Canada.  I noted there were several more, but due to trees and such could not determine any more which might be in formation.  They disappeared shortly after, just faded away like they were never there.  I looked online and something similar was captured on video along Lake Erie, New York, except those could be seen with the naked eye.

My neighbor up the road has seen and managed to catch almost the same unidentified objects on film also. Last night 11/4 I was startled with a close encounter. I woke up in the middle of the night to let the animals out. When I swung open my front door I immediately seen at least 10 orbs hovering above my yard. I love in the country with very little neighbors close by, so it's always dark with no lights obstructing the view. When I looked up at them they were floating or swaying down towards the ground real slow. These were orange in colored and would fade out when there was movement on the ground. This incident scared me and I immediately shut the door and curtains and went to our bedroom. Normally I'll stay up and watch these orbs just to see what they do and make sure that I'm truly seeing what I'm seeing. I've mentioned to it to family members about these sightings! and everyone just brushes it off to be a plane which is so frustrating. So tonight I was outside putting firewood in our outdoor furnace and noticed 2 LED colored orbs across the road by the farm equipment hoovering. There was 3 over in the field where the horses graze and 5 to my left further on up the road at my grandmother's farm where the cows are. Watching there movements is incredible. It's this graceful swaying at times to no movement. The LED orbs are so bright it hurts your eyes to look at. I've pulled out binoculars to see what it could be and it's so bright. At times you can see them turning in circles when hoovering in one spot. Almost like a flashlight turning with them. I was watching one hoovering in front of my neighbors window at night(she lives on top of the mountain, me in valley but at night now that leaves are off the trees I can see her lights coming from their living room. Mt husband and I literally watched this orb hoovering within eyesight of her w! indow. We watched it come down from the sky and stay there for! well ov er 30 mins. It then slowly and gracefully lowered down into the valley and worked it's way over the cattle field also triggering a motion light as it passed right by. This particular orb wasn't no more than 30 feet from the ground. The last thing I want to mention is, last night when I seen the ones hoovering in my front yard that scared me. Later that night 3am ish I seen this bright bright white light coming through my curtains. I glanced out the crack and saw 2 orbs hoovering above my truck. It was so bright it lookws like the sun was shining. It was so crazy. I'm such a thrill seeker and get so excited seeing unexplained things such as these. Buy lately, it's getting to close for comfort and now I'm just genuinely freaked out bc I have no clue what this is. We've been seeing these more frequently. And my husband is dumbfounded with no explanation on what we are seeing. Before he would blow it off. But not now. We seem to always see orbs. Orange and the bright LED color. ! We have watched blinking red crafts that stay in one spot for long periods of time and take off. These blinking ones defy the odds of being a plane or drone. The movement has been incredibly fast and my neighbors has a video of a fleet. I've never seen anything like it in my life. I've reached out to my brothers who are in the military and they were amazed at what they seen to. I would welcome a team of investigators to stay on our farm for 1 week to document and explain to us what we are seeing. And I'm not sure if this means anything but when we've tried to film with our cell phones our batteries drain so fast or our phones shut off even if they are at 50% battery life. Maybe its the temperature changes maybe not. But this is the 2nd battery I've had to replace on my cell since spring of 2020.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,,

Made quick 90* turns. stopped then accelerated out of sight to west Its been a couple days of thought and analysis since Friday, August 9, at 5:20 pm.  It was sunny and 100+ degrees as I finished readying the inflatable pool to entertain my soon to arrive grandchildren the next morning.  At the far end of my driveway where I was filling the pool, an opening between the trees and rooftops provided a small window of observation to the Southwest as the sun was setting. I cast my gaze to that area and wasn’t surprised to see motion in the cloudless sky. The river a half mile away attracts many predator type birds, hawks, eagles, vultures who circle the area looking for a meal. At first that is what I thought I saw even though there were no other birds in the sky and no sounds in the air. Each thing I describe is worth noting. Friday at 5 pm everyone downtown has left for the burbs. They aren’t watching the skies, they aren’t pausing to watch wildlife.  The heat wave we’ve been experiencing is too extreme for the birds to be active lest they expire.  As I adjusted my new sunglasses I watched him....it.  Too far away, too high in the air to be a bird. At that distance a bird, even an Eagle, would have looked smaller. So, I took the sunglasses off to get a different look. It was gone. Put them back on...it reappeared.  Okay, I mused, these are polarized. Must make a difference. But it isn’t a bird.  As if to confirm that, it began a slow, easy turn and then stopped in mid-air. I am used to seeing birds search for wind currents and appear to be still when working a heat draft or a headwind.  I find that entertaining.  What I am not used to seeing is birds making a quick, tight, “S” curve, a hard right, stop again and then accelerate out of sight to the West. I considered that we have a National Guard base nearby and when those guys do acrobatics and high speed take offs, it is impressive but at that height their silhouette and small size make them hard to even see. They don’t make clean 90 degree turns either.  And the sound they leave behind during acceleration to get to that altitude is recognizable.  This vehicle was at the height that multi engine bombers fly at, higher than most commercial planes and unlikely to be doing the maneuvers I observed.  It didn’t seem to be one of the Guard fighters.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,36.109455879967555,-95.93524541768045

Heading up Belleview towards Broadway for a good 10 minutes noticed the location of the lights remained unchanged, also noticed several other blinking lights, at points around the bottom left point, lights location did not change but the appearance (color) pattern and visual of lights did change, periodically. Asked my passenger what we were seeing, to confirm that my witness also saw the object. We could not determine what it was we were seeing, but felt scared and compelled to document the incident in 2 photographa that I have also submitted. The triangle craft would periodically show 3 lights at triangular points revealing a HUGE object. After this, it would go back to 1 singular light remaining lit, unblinking at one of the 3 points. Several times, almost in a pattern, there would be a flashing light succession that would travel from the bottom left up to the top middle point, which was terrifying to witness. Honestly, the pictures are not great, I should have taken a video, but was very unsure of its presence and intent. We felt best to continue to our location in case it was a foreign presence/ entity. The entire 15 minutes that my eyes were locked on the object (we were driving towards it for over 10 minutes), the location of the possibly mile wide at base object was unchanged.

The only way I can describe what I saw is by saying that it looked like the moon fell out of the sky. It was a silver-blue orb in the sky that darted toward the horizon in less than 5 seconds. It has been a relatively clear night sky but the orb in question had a halo effect around the center that made it appear as though it were shining behind a cloud sheet. From where I was standing at the time it appeared to be moving either south or south west. Unfortunately, I did not have a view of the horizon line at the time of the incident, but it certainly did look as though something was falling and not flying given how fast the object moved. The city of Louisville has a lot of air traffic so most people can attest to seeing large aircrafts in the sky at almost any given time of day. In fact, at the time of the incident, there was an airplane in the same line of sight as the strange object. There are no comparisons between the mystery object and the airplane at all. The lights on the airplane were smaller and more clearly visible than the large moon-like object I saw, which leads me to believe the object was either further away than the airplane or at a higher altitude. I was the only person in my party at the time of the event and I can not verify any other witnesses. I was in a high-traffic area in a small metropolitan during the time of the event so I would make the assumption others would have seen it in the area. My only concern is that because the city has so much air traffic flow others might mistake the object as a local air craft. My first instinct was to write it off as an aircraft as well. I probably wouldn’t have reported it either except the whole scenario kept bugging me. I do not have any knowledge of air traffic control or flight patterns, however I do have many years experience in the field of optics and I can say that whatever I saw was not an illusion or trick of the light. I did go through the trouble of making an illustration of what I saw, and provided map details as well. Originally I thought I was seeing the object moving north or north-east but after looking further into the details I realize it’s more like south or southwest.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,38.21121446765155,-85.68918456444217

The ship looked extremely ridged and weird and clearly looked like something that would fly, but looked way to weird to be any type of military plane or anything I know.  I’m not one to jump to conclusions but the minute  I saw the convoy and what looked like a hidden ship after we had just passed Area 51 I thought it might be something.  The cops escorting the craft were DPS arizonia highway patrol and they were heading from Nevada to arizonia, specifically one of the roads between Boulder City and kingman arizonia (therefore they traveled all the way from arizonia to Nevada to escort whatever was under the tarp to arizonia).I have multiple videos I took along the way since they were on the same road as us, if interested please contact me.

I want to say I have always tried to discredit the experiences I have had because I'm a logical person who does NOT believe in any life beyond the earth.  However, I have had too many experiences and finally I broke and had to say something.  I needed to talk someone. I know you just want to have my recent ""sighting"" but I have to first get a few things off my chest so I no longer have to be the only one who knows what I think I have experienced.  When I was a child between the age of 8 and 12 I had numerous odd experiences.  I would on a regular basis have very vivid and frightening dreams of aliens.  I had a very basic and happy childhood and was not allowed to watch anything that would have remotely inspired nightmares but I constantly had dreams of aliens.  So much in fact I would fear the impending time each night that my parents would issue the bedtime order, knowing I had a very good chance of a dream. One dream I had in particular over and over again was me walking in my back yard until I realized I was walking on the body of a red alien type creature.  I could always see the heart beating beneath me.  When I would wake I found myself feeling as if there was a figure in my room.  Out of pure terror I could not move, I could not scream.  I honestly believed there was always someone there with me.  I specifically remember always then feeling as if the presence left my room and I always was convinced I could see a light outside my window that was alot brighter than anything I would have expected in a tiny town in the middle of northern Minnesota.  Anyways, I just needed to share that portion of what I used to experience but now I will bore you no longer and get to the sighting recently. I was up in the lake of the woods, minnesota side camping with my 3 friends and our girlfriends.  All was as expected until the second night.  My friends and I decided to take a hike around 10:30 after all our girlfriends went to bed.  It was dark of course but that was part of the fun.  We walked for a good hour until we all at once took notice of some bright lights.  At first we thought it was some one else camping even though we hadn't seen anyone or maybe a patrol but again there wasn't much to patrol in the area we where in.  So, I'm sharing this here because my friends refuse to talk about this and I have to share it with someone.  They claim we must have been drunk, there is no way we saw what we saw.... but the fact is we all saw it and all talked about it immediately after.  There was a bright flashing light and then all of a sudden a more subtle yet distinct set of lights moving in some type of organization.  Did not seem random but rather planned.  The lights moved very qui! ckly and then would stop and rest in some odd patterns.  Then they would move again just the same.  This all lasted several minutes and was incredible and terrifying just the same.  Terrifying because we could not explain it. I took out my phone and got a 20 second video of the lights when they moved and stopped in that odd pattern. I dont know what happened, I cant explain it but it has been weighing on me for the past two months and I have done a ton of research for an explanation to the point of obsession. The worst part about this whole thing was my video is time stamped 11:48 p.m.  Our experience ended shortly after.  We freaked out for a minute and then walked back to camp.  Maybe, it could have taken us 40 minutes to get back because we where koving quickly but when we got back all our girlfriends where up worried about usn they began to yell at us because we dissapeared for so long. We said it wasn't that big of a deal its only got to be 12:30 or so. My buddies girlfriend said it is actually after 3 a.m. . I do not understand that.  How where we gone that long?  Thank you for your time.  I just needed to share this with someone and it feels better already, other than the dreams I used to have happening again.  I'm sure that is just me thinking about the past though.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,,

Not from a plane, which are very common in the area as the airport is appx 2 miles from that specific location. Instead, this light was emanating from within a cloud and was green in color, and the area it covered appeared larger than a regular airplane which I observe on a regular basis. It appeared that the light was either square or triangular in shape vs. round or elongated. It was in the eastward direction, at a decent height but low enough in the sky to be noticeable within my windshield view. And without a sound or other event, the light zoomed off in such a fast speed that I can only describ! e it by saying that if I had looked away or blinked at that moment, I would have missed it entirely and thought the light had just vanished. It had accelerated off into the eastward direction.

My name is [redacted] and I am a high school student. Last night at around 23:30, My two friends and I biked to Lower Moreland's track field where we parked our bikes. I took a look around and into the sky. At this moment,up and toward the end of the track I saw something that seemed out of place. What caught my eye was a yellowed amber dot. However, the, ""dot"" was not blinding or irritating to the eye as it appeared to be very elevated and far away (just like any other light in the sky). As mentioned earlier, I said this dot was, ""-out of place"" but stars, galaxies, and planets are all sorts of shapes and colors, this one honestly just happened to catch my interest (I would like to describe the moment I locked my eyes on it as a coincidence). I stare at it and I notice it's moving. To this, I thought, ""Geez, is the earth really rotating that fast, I wonder if it's possible to see such a thing.&! quot;. Soon after as in seconds or a minute, the ""dot"" (to which I now would like to refer to as an object) darted in a smooth motion however, quickly, to the left, maybe right.  No matter what direction it moved in, I began to see obvious movement from the ball of light which seemed to leave trails of it's color for split seconds as it slowly moved or dashed across the sky. I would like to say that it wasn't zooming all over the sky like some crazy ufo, these movements were subtle yet very noticable, when stared at. It may have looked only an inch or two across the sky if you measured it from our eyes, but it was definitely covering great distance in each movement we saw due to the seemingly extremely high elevation. So, after this incident and observation I call it out to my friends. Here, I debate with them and we argue until we all begin to really see it. The highly elevated object or, ""ball of light"" was no plane as it moved and stood staionary and i! t was very unlikely no helicopter, due to it's appearance of h! igh alti tude, above any planes we saw fly under it. As we stood there on the left side of the track in the middle, we recorded, took photos and discussed what we had been seeing. During the time we were there, the object had moved enough for us to realize our brains were not tricking us and it really was going staionary to not stationary, and stationary again. Planes somewhat low to the ground compared to the object were leaving an airport somewhere off in the distance. Another plane sighting happened when a plane (airport plane) flew next to the object whilst still much futher below the object to which it reacted and moved away from ths plane below it. This plane was much higher than the ones we saw ""low to the ground"" and further below the object which determined it's high elevation. 2 of the ""highest"" planes were counted passing through using the dame path at different times, which were not noted. After we noted all of these things and got footage of the yello! wed, bright, and amber light/object, I wanted to get my phone to record, which I left at Friend 1's house. Friend 2 and I were staying at his house that night until further events. That aside, Friends 1 and 2 decide it is now in best interest to get home as fast as possible because of this extremely eerie yet stunning incident (they were freaked out). As I get my belongings, Friend 1 and Friend 2 take off on bikes to the right side of the field (the right side facing it from the road). Let it be known, I had not been paying much attention to the movements, rather it's position because the movements were too hard to make note of riding a bike. I told Friends 1-2 to keep constant eyes on the object. As I make my move to their side of the field, it follows. We group up and bike as quickly as we can back home, it follows and follows and follows as we keep our eyes locked on it the whole way to Friend 1's home. We reach the house and realize it is very differently orientated com! pared to where it was at the field and we draw the conclusion ! that it had followed all of us or just I. Here, we observe the object with a telescope as it had pretty much completely halted it's movement as we couldn't notice any more. Here, multiple times, I take note of red light(s) quickly appearing and reappearing in front of the object (the lights were smaller). We made multiple phone calls to non-witnesses and bring Friend 1's Dad out to see. At this moment it is 1:00am-1:30am, 11/7/2020. We decide to go inside and leave it alone. Friend 2 is picked up by the father of Friend 2 past 1:30 and before 2:00. I check the objects position as he leaves and it was still there, arguably in the same spot. Past 2:00 and before 4:00 I take a video and the object is not to be seen from anywhere we previously viewed it at Friend 1's house. The report was finished at 5:18, submitted at 5:21, 11/7/2020.

Noticed three large lights in northern sky making perfect triangle.  Perfect triangle and very large in sky.  Went inside to use Google sky to identify objects.  Nothing matched the program like the triangle shape being natural.  Not visible to the naked eye.  Plain as day with 3rd gen night vision.  Shape was gone when I came back out approx 25 min later.

This first “satellite” was soon followed by a second “satellite”, moving along the exact same path as the first one. The path was from west-northwest, to east-southeast. I thought it was unusual that two satellites would be moving so close together along the exact same path, when I noticed a third, fourth and more “satellites” moving across the sky. After about the fifth object crossed the sky, I noticed that bright objects were falling below the line of the “satellites,” travel, and that they would flare to maximum brightness about 15 degrees below the line of travel that the “satellites” were taking. I interpreted the increase in brightness to be the heat generated by objects entering the atmosphere. After a couple of seconds, the falling objects’ brightness would dim, and I could no longer see them. I counted at least 15 “satellites” moving along the same path, and about as many objects falling below the path of the “satellites”.  A sixteenth “satellite” then followed, but traveled a path that appeared to bow out slightly from the path the previous fifteen “satellites” took, and eventually moved back onto the same path as the rest of the “satellites”. I would note that the falling objects did not appear to breakup into smaller pieces, as you might expect a piece of falling space debris to do, but remained intact during their descent, and their appearances were evenly spaced, matching the spacing between the “satellites”.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,43.348,-76.3422

I was wearing dark polarized sun glasses and could not see these objects at all when I took my sun glasses off.  They seemed to spin or rotate because they went from being round looking to a straight line perpendicular to the ground and then back round again.  I could not tell how big they were because there was nothing to reference them to.  At first they seemed to float, then one of them shot straight south really fast. The other one stopped and stayed motionless. The one that had zipped away stopped and zipped right back over to the one that stopped.  A normal airplane went by behind them and it was really slow compared to how fast they scooted across the sky.  I did not hear any noise or sound from the objects.  I watched them for another 30 seconds or so and they just went away. The whole thing lasted maybe a minute and a half to two minutes.

I turned south on Sprinkle road at E. H Ave.  While driving south of E. H Ave. I noticed several aircraft, ( more than 3 less than 10)  5-8? These aircraft had orange/yellow “landing lights?” Oriented East to West or Southeast to Northwest. The aircraft were spaced and sequenced uniformly some distance apart but uniform in appearance.  2.	My original thought was that Chicago MDW or ORD was backed up with arrivals and something out of the ordinary was happening with air traffic flows.  This was definitely not a normal aircraft operation for this area.  A scene to expect on a busy arrival time into a major airport but usually would not expect such traffic on a Sunday evening/night in the AZO area.  3.	As I drove South on Sprinkle Rd, the aircraft seemed lower and closer than first perceived. Too low to be traveling to MDW/ORD/GRR, and maybe too high and too many to be landing at AZO.  Again, not a normal aircraft operation.  4.	As I was driving south on Sprinkle I could not discern if the aircraft were actually moving.  I was moving and had no stable reference to tell if the aircrafts were actually traveling, but I did assume so.  5.	The orange/yellow “landing lights” were dominant.  I believe I saw strobe/blinking white lights but was unsure if I saw green or red nav lights.  The orange/yellow “landing lights” were about the same color as the street lamps, which seem a bit off knowing that most aircraft have a more white/yellow appearance.   The weather was clear VFR, scattering of light etc would not be a factor in my opinion.  6.	I was curious and this was strange enough that I decided to turn around to get a better view and understand what kind of aircraft they were.   I turned right (West) on E. Main St. and then turned around, Turned left (North/Northwest) again on Sprinkle.  7.	Traveling North on Sprinkle Rd, I did not see the original 5-8 aircraft again, assuming that they moved out of line of sight.  I did see one aircraft of the same type description to the East of me and above me, as I traveled North. I would estimate between 5-7 miles away? Not exactly sure.  However my view was hindered and I lost sight of the aircraft.  8.	I decided to make a U-turn on Sprinkle Rd.  There was no other vehicle traffic at that moment.  I turned around to head South again on Sprinkle Rd.  I quickly acquired the aircraft to the east visually, and I pulled off to the right on the shoulder.  Facing South on Sprinkle Rd.  I had my headlights on and turned my emergency flashers on as there was now a line of Southbound vehicle traffic.  9.	I rolled down my driver-side window to listen for helicopter blades or maybe UAV blades/ noise. The aircraft did not appear to be moving at any significant rate across the ground. The Southbound vehicle traffic obscured sounds. I did not hear or perceive any aircraft noise. I observed the aircraft for perhaps 1-2 mins.  10.	After 1-2 mins the aircraft lights were turned off and completely disappeared.  I did not see the aircraft turn away, there were no position lights, I did not see or hear any aircraft.  11.	I waited and observed the area of the sky for a couple more minutes, thinking that the aircraft may turn its lights back on.  12.	As I was watching the area, I noticed a small black motion blur quite close just to the east of and across Sprinkle Rd. Perhaps 50-100 yards east of Sprinkle Rd. There was a tree line.  At first I thought it was just a misperception, but as I kept looking in that direction, I noticed a parachute .  13.	This observation was at my 9 oclock, position or nearly 90 degrees from my driver-side window.  14.	The parachute was not a steerable type, It was a round ‘drifter’ type.  It also appeared to be too small to support a human jump. Something that supported a small payload.  I did not see the payload  15.	At that time I was confused and scared. Seeing a small parachute falling when and where it did, just did not compute for me.  I had no idea what it was carrying etc.  16.	I decided to quickly get the heck out of there and continued to drive South on Sprinkle with no further observations of aircraft or other aircraft or anomalies.   Although a strange encounter,  It is very likely that this was some sort of explainable event.  Perhaps the military or National Guard etc, were performing maneuvers? I find it likely that the aircraft were perhaps helicopters.  I do know that these aircraft were not like any police or search helicopters with search lights,  I have witnessed those aircraft before and this bears no resemblance.  I just want to put this event on record to perhaps be investigated and explained.  I am a professional pilot with vast experience in aviation.   I have no agenda, I am by nature a skeptic, and if I were to guess this is an explainable event but thought it out of the ordinary. But, by definition, it was a Un-identified Flying Objects event for me.  Thank-you for reading and taking this report into account.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,42.28467811900192,-85.60508272552782

Location: Augusta Township/Willis, Michigan..  It was a very clear, clean & crisp evening  Sunday 12-22-2019 at approximately 7p-7:30p.   I walked out of my barn facing directly due West.  I looked up at the night sky as I always do.  I immediately noticed 4 to 5 sequence of lights equally spaced out in a line.  My initial thought was the “Winter Solstice”, perhaps stars lined up as I have never seen before.  After looking closer I had noticed there was movement to the light.  My second thought was our Military. (I would guess this was at approximately 45,000 feet elevation and at 30&#8304; above the horizon)  I started counting the lights as they were moving.  I could only see 8 at one time.  (If I were to hold up a ruler to the sky where the lights were traveling, I would say that the activity would be roughly 8-9” in length at arm’s length). The lights continued to move steadily East into what appeared to be a “cloud/mass”.  I could see stars all around this mass but could not see stars beyond this mass.  I was compelled to continue to watch their path.  I noticed that not one part of the sequenced lights had exited this cloud like mass.  Then I realized something else was occurring. The “cloud/mass” that the lights were traveling into appeared to be 35&#8304; above the horizon.  This filled up my view to be approximately 35&#8304; wide and 15&#8304; up & down relative to size. I walked out further into the yard and noticed that these lights were continuously coming from a “void” in the sky.  At this point I had counted 12 + from the time I started counting but there were more in total.  There appeared to be a barrier (energy field?) just south of the lights.  I could only see 8 lights at one time and noticed that the 3 light exiting the “void” and the 3rd light entering the “cloud/mass” was much brighter than the others. I continued to watch for another 30-45 seconds and noticed a plane flying direct North towards the activity and at a much lower elevation.  (Approximately 25,000 feet).  From my sight this plane appeared to have “intercepted” the 3rd brightest light entering the “cloud/mass”.  It looked like the plane had paused then changed direction moving East North East in a sharp turn.  The 3rd light that was entering into the “cloud/mass” appeared to have shot off into the “cloud/mass”.  I noticed the 3rd brightest light exiting the “void” had shot off directly North and all other lights dissipated/vanished! As my attention was diverted to the aforementioned plane for a brief period of time, I then looked back in the vicinity of the “cloud/mass” and noticed a clear star field (the “cloud/mass” vanished) .",2020-02-07T00:00:00,42.11540000000001,-83.56930000000001

So as soon as I came into the clearing after the KC intersection, on my right there was what seemed to be some type of larger drone or possibly even a life flight helicopter. It was blinking green and white lights in a similar manner as they do, but I began to raise an eyebrow when I noticed that the lights were not moving like a helicopter or drone should. They remained stationary. Like it was just hovering directly over these people's houses, we're talking maybe 7! 5-100 ft tops. When stopped my vehicle, I did notice that there was someone else standing beside their vehicle there who was watching the same thing above their house as I was... so this was where my reasoning stemmed when I didn't report it before reading the Covington individual's account. I brushed it off because I'd figured it was just something logical since someone else was seeing it too and if it was important I would hear about it since it's a small town. However, as I drove further and further toward Kuhns sawmill I could still see the thing in my rear view every so often because it would do a weird ""strobing"" thing you'd expect from a strobe light. Extremely bright and white in color. I was about 2 or 3 miles away by the last time I could see it and its brightness hadn't changed in intensity from when I was right next to it- so to speak. What they seen up in Covington is pretty much what I seen in a rural area roughly two hours south from their location.! So I had to at least report it because even if it can be expl! ained, t hen these people are owed an explanation for why someone is basically invading their homes",2020-12-23T00:00:00,,

Event Details: At approximately 1900 hours I was leaving the CVS pharmacy located at 328 White Horse Pike in Pomona, New Jersey. As I was pulling out of the parking lot, I noticed a bright white ball rising from out of the tree line located directly behind the CVS and a construction site behind the store. The object got very bright and then faded back to its original luminosity. At this point I pulled my vehicle over and began recording the object with my phone. The object was very bright, round and about 1/10th the size of a full moon.  I noticed that It was much larger a star or planet would be in the night sky. After rising from above the tree line the object than remained stationary just above the tree line for approximately a minute and a half and then its brightness began to fade until it was gone. I heard no noise that might have been associated with a helicopter or aircraft. I live relatively close to the Atlantic City international Airport and there was aircraft visible in the sky! at the same time as the object, however aircraft look very different than what I saw and are much smaller and further away in the sky and emit a blinking light.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,,

I will never forget that night! On November 9, 2020 (around 21:00) I was outside sitting on my back deck.  I always look up at the stars when I am outside.  There weren´t a lot of stars out on this particular night.  While I was looking in the sky, I saw something that caught my eye.  I saw an odd form that was in the shape of a triangle that had two circular lights in the back and one in the front.  The lights were not bright but dim, and were located in the pockets of the triangle. As I was trying to get a better look at the object, I noticed that it was moving at a smooth, medium pace.  I only saw it for less than 30 seconds before it disappeared behind the roof of my house, heading eastbound.  I sat there and contemplated what I saw...Was it a plane?  Did I just see a UFO?  With my luck, my answer to that was ¨There&#347; no way I just saw a UFO or possibly anything!.¨  I knew it wasn´t a plane because of the shape, the speed it was traveling, and the lights being dim (plus there were no blinking lights like there are on planes).  After a few minutes, I still sat there wondering what I just saw. The night after it happened, I wished that I would have drawn a picture of what I witnessed.  I finally did this evening.  Without explaining the picture I drew, I showed it to my brother.  As soon as he saw it, he said that it looked like a UFO that he saw on a documentary he watched, going into significant details of the UFO that was spotted in IL 20 years ago (actually in the same town I spotted it).  I have another brother who lives in Vegas, and I texted him the picture, JUST the picture.  He responded right away with ¨Yeah.  The UFO over Millstadt.¨  Before this ¨sighting¨ I had never heard of the shape of the object nor seen it.  My brothers knew what it was before I even did, just by my amateur drawing. I watched the video on YouTube, UFO Over Southern Illinois.  The description of the object seen 20 years ago described the one I saw on November 9, 2020, not too far from the first sighting in 2000.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,38.465,-90.0978

Gets curious. Goes extremely fast exciting. I was taking out the trash at my condo. Why was I looking at the sky. Obvious question to the skeptical. I always loved a clear view of the stars, but especially, since I was 10 , in 1980, when I saw my first , and only other UFO. I always look up. I love the stars, yet, I am not knowledge in constellations, etc. I do know, when I am seeing a satellite. I love to watch, for the brief time, a satellite pass by. And at this time, I thought I was seeing one. I had put away the trash, went to the best location , to view stars, in my parking area( which isn't great. Parking lights create a lot of light pollution). I know, to get any good view of stars, I block direct light with my hands. I also know , from experience, look into the darkest areas of the sky, and look with my peripheral vision for movement. Not only that, but if you look into the darkestest areas, then, the dimmest stars will gradually appear slowly, and depending on several factors. Your sight, sky interference, of sorts etc.  you can hopefully see something , far away. That is the greatest. To see a faint star, that is so far away. I would so like to see it close. But to the point. That is how I saw this UFO. I clasped my hands, to block as much encompassing light around my vision, that was near me, that would prevent, what I might see in the sky. (Which would be a great thing for a UFO. Fly where there is much blinding city night light, as so to hide). I chose to look, (and its not always the same areas, but at this time, ),  at a darkened area of the sky. Not directly into any star or light. I was looking towards the East. In the East, San Francisco Bay Area, and my stare into the sky , by my estimate, was a 46 degree angle. It was cool. I'm not sure the temp. Sky clear as a bell. I had not a drink, nor drugs of any kind in my system. I must say, that the event, was not glamorous, such as, many videos online, tend to be. If this was video recorded, I feel, all would say its very boring to view.  To the view: 6:10pm pac time: I watched and saw , what I thought to be a satellite. I was excited. I loved catching rare views of satellites. But it slowed. I was instantly. Shocked. /unless there is technology, that allows a satellite to do the following. It was traveling south. Slowly. Smoothly. Then , it slowed. As if curious. But it didn't stop.  In my report, I used the word ""loopy loop"". That was not the correct wording to use. I was busy trying to remember and record, if I could , which wouldn't and et. Multitask. Currently, I would use the word, u-turn.  I saw , what I was seeing, and thought ...video record this! But , as I'm good with getting the video going, etc , I quickly realized, this was going to be a terrible shot. Too far away. Too dim. Just visuallize the event and tell someone. Essentially, it was smoothly sailing, much higher than a jet plane. About half as dim as a star. Then, it slowed, as if curious, then took a u-turn toward the north. It was a very gradual movement.  But, I've had a 1980 experience, where the UFO did a point-point-point instant take-off and stop. This was not that. This was a u-turn, very high, and if I placed my thumb to the sky, the u-turn was inside my thumb area. But extremely controlled. Not a tight turn but not extra wide. It brought out of the u-turn, just as gradually, as if viewing something of worth maybe, then proceeded north, and widening its flight pattern, slightly to the East, as it went forth.

Sighting occurred right after sunset.  At sunset, I noticed two strange ""sunbeams"" emanating in a ""V"" shape at the western horizon.  I took a picture of it.  Once the sun completely set, I saw the eight objects appear.....in the same vicinity as the two beams I photographed about 20 minutes earlier.  The objects started out in a ""V"" formation....and primarily appeared to be a flock of geese, but they emanated a translucent iridescent glow that caused me to stay focused on them.  As they progressed across the sky, the formation changed to single file, then a circle, then a hopskotch-type action.  I realized they were definitely not geese, and thought maybe they were hangliders....each with a candle-type glow.  Their movement was haphazard as they got right above me....some were stationary for 20-30 seconds while the others circled them in no specific pattern.  It was as if they were being ""playful"" with each other.  Rea! lizing that their altitude was too high for a hanglider, I wondered if they were some odd type of parachutes(that glowed)....but when they started ascending....one after the other....I knew they were not.  They emitted no sound whatsoever.  They seemed to be headed for the heaviest cloud-cover in the visible sky.  Once they were obscured by the cloud cover, I lost sight of them.  I took several photos, but only two of them showed pin-point-type lights.  What I saw was not lights powered by a known energy source.  They ""glowed"" with a translucent, iridescent light....all white...no color...no blinking. I cannot believe that other people did not see this anamoly.  It was very visible, and the sighting lasted about eight minutes. There is no explanation.  Too high and quiet to be drones. The stop/start/fast/slow irregular nature is inexplicable. I will never forget it.....and wonder what -if any- relation they had to the two strange pre-sunset beams that shone from the western horizon.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,35.96156134085213,-83.98011528822055

I was alone on my balcony at 0140 gazing at the stars on a clear night and a bright light(what I thought was a star) caught my attention.  Then, I noticed it was ""bobbing"" in a vague shadow circular type of ""hole"" or space between the stars.  I watched for 3o min. and noticed it was never stationary, it was always bobbing, then I became intrigued when the light suddenly darted at a precise 90 degree angle, returned to the neutral position continued bobbing, then darted rapidly extreme left, back to center (neutral), then a couple of minutes later it darted extreme right, back to center, bobbed for about 4 minutes, then darted upward in a precisional straightline straight up and remained bobbing at the top of the dark area (hole) in the sky.  What was interesting is that the movements were so well calculated and straightline.  At one point when it was bobbing I thought it was a light moving to music.  I fully expected I would see it go shooting off into the atmosphere, but it didn't.  Instead, it inched around at the top of the dark space or ""hole"" in the sky and continued bobbing around but never left the space where it was positioned in the shadow zone. In fact, the light or craft behaved as if there were boundaries in the dark shadow zone and was always remaining within those boundaries.  At one point the light skirted around the top of the dark shadow area.  So best way to describe it is that it remained in it's neutral zone and moved in calculated straightline movements never leaving the circular dark area between the stars. The light was far enough away that I could not determine anything more than just a bright light that appears round. I recall last year hearing a radio show (George Noori) conversation with military pilots discussing UFO's darting around their aircraft when they were in flight one night.  This sighting I had on Christmas morning at 0140 was very similar to the military pilots had! described insofar as the erratic and sudden movement of the U! FO's the y had sighted one night. Decided to report this given the very peculiar movement of the bright light that I sighted 18 hours ago.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,30.3910074829932,-90.03365442176872

Bright Sphere in NW sky between Elnath (Taurus) & Capella zipping around in erratic pattern.  High altitude. I took my dog outside at 3 am so she could do her business. It was a clear crisp night, with little cloud cover, so I was admiring the beautiful stars in the night sky.  No moon was visible at the time. I looked to the NW at Capella which was very clear & bright.  Then I looked towards Elnath in the Taurus constellation, which was also clearly visible with the naked eye.  Between these two stars were a few fainter stars,Kabdalinan &  Mahasim, and then I saw movement. In between Elnath & Capella  where no visible stars were, an object was zipping around in an erratic manner.  Sharp 90 degree turns right, left, up, down & then diagonally.  No dissernable path or logic  was evident in it's flight pattern & no great distance was covered. It would move a couple of inches left then up a couple then back.  It was extremely high up, but was not moving between the stars, more like it was searching the area for something.  I heard no sound, & there were no airplanes or helicopters in the sky at that time of the morning.  Stars don't move in different directions & back & forth. I got my binoculars out to make sure I was seeing this thing move & sure enough it was still zipping in every direction.  I watched it for a good 10 - 15 min. totally amazed at the manuverability of this object  I've lived near numerous airports & military bases & have never seen any air craft with this capability. I ended up leaving the binoculars out, so that I would remember this event in the morning. Even as I was doing so, I was trying to convince myself it was a dream. But I figured if they were left out & not put away then they would remind me of the encounter in the morning. No binoculars - it was a dream. Binoculars left out... It really happened. Low & behold they were there in the morning.

While driving I saw extremely low flying craft of a shape that I was unable to determine.  It was flashing very large green and red lights.  I thought that perhaps it had something to do with the Christmas holiday.  It was flying so low that I thought for a second that it might be a drone.  But its size was much too large for that to be the case. Since I was driving I was unable to get a clear look at it.  I thought it was a helicopter but it just didn’t seem consistent with that for a few reasons.  Firstly, the height at which it was flying and the speed at which it was moving didn’t seem like normal operations for a helicopter.  If it was a helicopter flying at that height it should have produced a fairly loud sound and I have no recollection of there being the well-known buzz of a chopper.  I was able to see it for maybe ten seconds at most, focusing on the road and glancing up to try to get a look at it.  By the time I was able to pull over, within 30 seconds tops there was no sight of it whatsoever, nor was there any residual sound.

Want to report this sighting that occurred last night in December the 26th, 2019.

It struck me extremely odd when my son said to me suddenly, moments after I began feeling the symptoms, that his mouth tasted as if he had a penny in his mouth! As my son said this he placed both his hands over his head, clearly a sign that he, as well, was feeling that of the same symptoms as me!  This was at night however , for that of a split second the  lighting of the sky appeared that of an orange/purplish light color ... resembling that of a sunrise!  We both exchanged a nonverbal look, a look that gave me a chill up my spine, as it had confirmed to me that indeed, my son as well had seen the same strange phenomenon. It is then that my son looked up & his eyes widened so large it frightened me!  My son pulled, rather tugged me inside the Walgreens and had stated to me that he had seen that of a wide large light greyish object that was not to far above from us... only a few feet up above the Walgreens.  At this point in time I did not see what he had just described, just te sky within a split of a second turning into that of a sunrise color.  I calmed him down while we was in the Walgreens photo section and reassured him that due to the sky turning a different color, perhaps as it subsided he thought he had seen what he just described.  When we got home, I went to the back last room of our house, which is one of my eldest son’s room. To my utter shock and disbelief, the metallic taste in my mouth along with the headache, which I had experienced along with my son and had left once we saw that ‘strange sunrise’ just a mere 20 to 30 minutes earlier by the Walgreens.  I was in quite a stage of shock!  Due to the notion that my son has 3 windows parallel to one another, I quickly gave a fast glimpse, expecting to see that ‘strange sunrise’ , if you will... except, this time,   i had witnessed was definitely out of this world!  A long, grey rectangle.. or should I say ship looking object slowly past the 2 front windows first ... in that of a slow motion, making a left to the 3rd window!  I quickly looked at my son’s closet mirror, which allows me to see 2 of the windows of his room to see if what i had just seen was there or what in the world was going on?!  Next thing I know I was awakened by my son asking me if my migraine (I am a chronic migraine sufferer) has subsided .... I quickly jumped up from the bed and just couldn’t believe what was happening!  It was as if one minute I was staring into the mirror and the next being awakened, mind you, tucked in, in my son’s bed!",2020-02-07T00:00:00,40.72497775784753,-74.06215219730942

Three Shiny Objects in the Evening Sky  On the evening of November 13, 2020, I was standing on my front porch facing the direction of south. The time was 5:30 pm, and the sun was beginning to set. There were a few scattered clouds in the sky, but nothing to obscure my vision. I noticed a bright light in the sky, traveling from the south to the north in a liner direction. When the bright light approached the cloud, an orange color surrounded the moving object. This object was quiet and no contrail was discovered. The orange glow lasted for a brief time (approx. five seconds or so).  After seeing this questionable object in the evening sky, I wanted to verify the identity of this object. I returned to the house and located a spare riflescope that placed on a shelf in my bedroom closet. I returned to the front porch to observe this object  to closer examine it with the aid of a multi power riflescope ( this scope has the power to multiply the image of a target from three times to nine times the size seen with the naked eye). I used the highest degree of magnification to identify the object in question. While looking thru the scope, all I could identify was a small shiny object; I could not discern any features with this rifle scope. I have used this same optical device to identify the ISS; I have seen the shape and colors of the ISS.  After trying to identify the object in question, I discovered two similar objects accompanying the object I was examining. All three objects were traveling in a triangular fashion. The objects appeared to resemble a formation that traveled the same direction and kept the same speed between them. I aimed the spare riflescope at each of the objects, but I was unable to discern any details of each object.  I continued to observe the three objects until the trees concealed them. I observed them for approximately 40 seconds. I live near Seymour Johnson AFB in eastern North Carolina, and we have F-15E fighter jets and KC-46 refueling aircraft. The military aircraft produce a loud exhaust emitted from the jet engines, and they can be heard from several miles away. I have seen the fighter jets engaged in full afterburner at night; they do not stay in full afterburner for extended periods because the afterburners will quickly consume hundreds of pounds of fuel in a very short period. The objects in question were not commercial aircraft either; I have used lower powered binoculars to identify jet powered passenger aircraft flying at their regular altitudes (they produce a contrail from the hot exhaust cooling in the extreme cold high altitudes they cruise at).  I could not identify these objects. They were shiny. They flew in an orderly fashion. They were quiet. I could not identify them as conventional jet powered aircraft. They emitted no contrails. They were too high in altitude to clearly identify them (although I can identify any civilian/military aircraft with assisted optics: spare rifle scope or binoculars). The objects traveled in a steady and smooth path; no deviations.  What did I witness? I do not know. There were three shiny objects that traveled across the evening sky.  I have witnessed satellites, the ISS, shooting stars, military fighter jets engaged in afterburner at higher altitudes engaged with other fighter jets, and dirigibles. Dirigibles do not move across the horizon at the altitude and speed I witnessed.  I noticed the first object projected an orange glow (that encompassed the entire object) when approaching a nearby cloud, but the orange glow ended shortly. The object never traveled below the cloud. The orange cloud may have been an image produced by the reflection of the setting sun.  Whatever they were, I haven’t a clue. I could not positively identify them with my spare riflescope.  There were three, and they traveled in a triangle formation. No other aircraft were available in the area. I have never experienced an event like this. Three shiny objects traveling south to north in a triangular formation that traveled in a steady course with no deviation.

To whom it may concern, the following information as requested, on 8 December 2020 at 0055 Eastern:  I was the Captain of  ((airline and flight # deleted)) on November 13, operating from Charlotte, NC to Harrisburg, PA. That flight departed the gate in CLT at 2017 local time. After takeoff, while climbing through an altitude of roughly 15,000 feet heading north, I saw an object out of the corner of my eye that then moved with very significant relative speed from the top of my field of view to at or below my perceived nighttime horizon, nearly vertically down with slight movement from left to right. It was moving at a speed consistent with a meteor, but white with no tail, and at roughly the horizon, it instantaneously stopped with no deceleration and changed direction, with no curvature of turn, to the north or northeast, roughly a few degrees right of our course. It disappeared away from our aircraft to the north in a fraction, maybe a quarter, of the time it took to move from the top of my field of view to the nearly the bottom. The light’s movement away appeared to me as a rapid dimming wi! th slight movement to the right, which leads me to at the least perceive it as having rapidly moved away outside my range of sight to the north; that is how aircraft look as they disappear out of sight, albeit multiples slower. This entire event was a matter of a couple to a few seconds. The movement of the object from above to the horizon was roughly 1.5-2 seconds, the movement away possibly .5 seconds. This is an estimation based on perception.  With regard to our immediate interpretation of and reaction to the event, as well as my current opinion regarding it, I was immediately puzzled by what I saw. I said to my First Officer “Did you see that?”. His response was “Ya I saw that.” I said “that was not a meteor”, and he echoed that sentiment and said something to the effect of “It turned”. I then said “that wasn’t a plane either”, and my first officer agreed. We bounced ideas off each other for a few moments. During a quick shuffling of possible explanations in my head, an aircraft moving vertically toward earth had momentarily been an alarming one of them. But airplanes accelerate and decelerate, and when they turn, the turn is accomplished with curvature. They also have more lights than just bright white. This object moved across our entire field of view with great speed, instantaneously stopped with no deceleration, and shot off to the north, as if from a cannon. The angular change in direction was almost like a ! pinball bouncing off the bumper of a pinball machine, but with maybe the slightest pause as it made contact. Or a child’s bouncy ball bouncing off an angled surface dropped from above, rapidly changing direction to move laterally. It was not an airplane. We also discussed meteors, to include that we had both seen many meteors from aircraft throughout thousands of hours of flight time. The confident consensus was that the object had not been a meteor, for several reasons. First, and least compelling, was that they usually have a tail. This white, almost bluish white, object had no tail. More importantly, it would have been a meteor moving almost directly downward through our atmosphere with no flickering and no breakup. Beyond that, it would have been a clean, crisp, white meteor with no flickering, no tail, and no breakup, moving downward through our atmosphere to roughly our altitude before making a sudden and instantaneous, deceleration and acceleration-free, 90 degree tu! rn to the north, disappearing faster than it crossed our field! of view It was not a meteor. After ruling out a few possibilities,  it became clear that this object did not behave like anything either of us had ever seen while in flight. It showed no signs of being affected by an apparent enormous speed through our atmosphere, and it stopped and changed direction with seemingly no obedience to the Newtonian physics that we have such significant intuition for. Nothing I’ve seen, including fighter jets, change direction that sharply or move at that speed. We asked ATC, I believe Atlanta or Washington Center, if they had picked up an object rapidly descending in front of us. They mentioned an aircraft still above us slowly descending to another altitude above us. This was clearly not related to what we saw.  After several minutes discussing what we had seen, as well as the likelihood of us catching both flack and a drug test for a report of this nature, we both agreed that the right thing to do was to report it to air traffic control. We did that, and by that time, I believe Washington Center took my report. We also notified dispatch via ACARS message. We both possess copies of those messages. After providing that report, I thought to myself that the object’s path of motion had looked very much like a reverse checkmark, and I recall asking my first officer to draw the path he saw before communicating that specific notion to him. Whether I did ask or not, at that time he drew precisely that and handed it to me, the mirror image of a check mark, with the long side on the left, the short side on the right. We spoke about the object a few more times during that flight and trip, but we have not spoken about or corroborated our descriptions of the events we are both separately submitt! ing, in order to not influence our individual recollection. On November 17th, an FAA UFO investigative team member contacted me through a member of company management and spoke with me before asking permission to pass my information to you for your organization’s investigative purposes.

Reported to local police some time ago.  My father was a pilot and I grew up flying and watching the sky. These objects are unlike anything I have ever seen before.  They capture my attention because I can’t figure out what they are...I thought they might be military-related due to our location and close proximity to secure government sites.

The sky was very clear other than some fog in the far distance. My wife was counting the number of objects until ran back into the house for more clothing(-8c). I gave up counting as didn't find it important and started looking around for camera and neighbors, anyone to point out and share an epic moment with, but nobody was outside.(Too dark for photograph) Terrifying thrilling better than any Netflix.

There was a single flashing orb. It flickered and bounced around a small area from my viewpoint. I thought it may be a plane but it clearly was not moving like a plane and the encounter was for 15-20 minutes so a plane or satellite would have been long gone in a shorter time frame. The orb continued to flicker and jump. I caught it on video and photograph. I noticed little arcs of light coming off the orb a few times. Then near the end it appeared to be two orbs. But I’m not sure if the one orb was just bouncing that fast. In my video though you can see two orbs of light moving in tandem with a beam of light between them as the moved and flicked for a moment. Then they were gone.,2020-12-23T00:00:00,35.47186177914111,-97.52630349693251

Looking out the bedroom window, I could see a cloudless sky full of stars (Orion and the Seven Sisters were both visible). It was then that I noticed movement across the sky from the treeline towards the house (roughly moving from west-southwest to east-northeast) of what appeared to be a whitish-blue satellite.  I rubbed my eyes and grabbed my glasses to watch it as it moved, as it appeared to be deviating from its course in sporadic bursts that were perpendicular to its direction of travel, at times seeming to zigzag back and forth across its general direction of travel.  I call them bursts because each time the object appeared to return to its main path, and the speed of the bursts was eight to ten times faster out and back than the speed of the general pathway that the object was taking.  I have watched the skies since I was a kid and have seen countless satellites-- including the space station, but I had never seen that kind of motion that high up in either the outer atmosphere or in outer space. I checked the data from the Heavens-Above website and could not find a satellite traveling along that orbit at that time on that night, so I do not know what I saw which is why I am reporting it here  https://www.heavens-above.com/AllSats.aspx?lat=34.11036&lng=-118.44846&loc=house&alt=300&tz=PST",2020-02-07T00:00:00,,

Brightest in sky .. no it's moving .. plane /helicopter! or military aircraft that often travel overhead at these hours .. No noise.. completely will for about a minute no aircraft does this .. helicopter make noise.. meteor,  comet you name it I considered it .. all of these were not even close to fitting what i was witnessing before me and 100% certain in my observation that it was none if these.

And what an experience to miss out on even just visually .. on joining me he was also totally gobsmacked .. it's a ufo I exclaimed my partner.. who is thee biggest skeptic out .. agreed that what we were seeing was something totally crazy and unexplainable!! .. After the light sat stationery for around no it's maybe minute and half it took off at rapid pace North East bound at a great rate .. also solidifying no aircraft made  by man has this ability .. it eventually went out of sight.

We watched as these dots of light - about 3 or 4 to the best of my recollection - were stationary, then would independently move in a flash to another spot in the sky not far from where they had been, centered right above our position.  Then they would move again, and turn in a 90 angle.  Not long after we saw this, a few minutes at most, they zoomed off from a dead stop to extreme speed and went out of sight.  We were of course flabbergasted that something above us in the middle of nowhere in the night was lit up with star brightness, yet seemingly just a plain round shape, move so quickly at such extreme angles and speed.

Along with one Battery Control Officer (BCO) and 9 operators and maintenance crewmen we identified, selected and auto tracked what we believed to be an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO).  As a crew we acquired, tracked and documented all its movements during approximately 10 minutes (could be more or less time, just don’t remember). After 52 years I wanted to explain and document our manning crew’s experience selecting, tracking and recording this UFO event.  This tracking event took place in the year 1969 or 1970.  Memory does not serve me on the exact year and date.  Although I think it may have been 1969.  However, the UFO tracking event took place around midnight.  It starts by saying that the on-duty manning crewmembers were responsible for checks and adjustments and the operational condition of all assigned radars, vans, equipment and the integration of the system as a whole.  The system was kept ready to identify, track and launch a missile at a target in a specified time at the direction of Battalion Operations Center.  This was basically the mission of 3rd Battalion 71st Artillery Air Defense mission as part on North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  As part of this UFO event, I think it is necessary to provide background description of the overall system and manning skills of a Nike Hercules Missile Firing Battery:  The Firing Battery consisted of an Integrated Fire Control (IFC) and a Launch Area (LA) which were separated by approximately one mile.  That night we were manning the IFC which included the Low Powered Acquisition Radar (LOPAR), High-Powered Acquisition Radar (HIPAR) (not sure the HIPAR was on site at the time of the event) and the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) transmitter and receiver, these two radars and IFF were controlled by the Battery Control (BC) van.   The BC van was manned by the Battery Control Officer (BCO) and an Acquisition, Computer, Switch Board, and Early Warning Plotting Board operators.  These positions were all Military Occupational Specialty (MOSs) 16C Integrated Fire Control Crewmember and a Defense Acquisition Radar Mechanic 24P.  The RC van controlled the Target Tracking Radar (TTR), Target Ranging Radar (TRR) and Missile Tracking Radar (MTR) and was manned by 16Cs and a 24Q Integrated Fire Control Mechanic MOSs.  Manning for the RC van included Tracking Supervisor, Azimuth, Elevation and Range and MTR operators in the MOS 16C and a 24Q maintenance man.  All these men as I remember participated and witnessed the event discussed below. That night our crew was performing 6 hour checks and adjustments.  Which we performed every 6 hours during our 24- hour manning period.  After all the equipment was adjusted to a specific tolerance in accordance with the Technical Manuals (TMs) and to ensure everything was working together as a system, we would perform a simultaneous tracking test where a target was selected by BC van and electronically given to RC van and the tracking radars console operators in the van.  This test ensured all tracking radars were accurately auto tracking together in range, azimuth, elevation and speed.   This was then verified by the Computer in the BC van. On this particular night I was the Acquisition Radar operator 16C/On the Job Training (OJT) 24P Acquisition Radar Mechanic in the BC van.  For this particular simultaneous test, I selected a random target traveling in the direction of about 120 to 150 degrees in azimuth and at a range of 20-30 miles from our site and it had a good strong return signal from the Acquisition Radar and as displayed on the Planned Position Indicator (PPI) in the BC van.  I passed the target (UFO) off to the BC van where TTR, TRR and MTR operators auto locked on to the UFO and started auto tracking it.  At first it seemed to be a normal track, then it stopped in range and speed as shown on the tracking radars and verified by the Computer dials in the BC van.  The UFO continued to showed a signal return (we called radar blip) on the PPI in the BC van.  At this point it was challenged with the IFF.  It did not respond to the challenge.  Then the UFO started moving left and then right in azimuth within one or two PPI sweep revolutions. It showed no speed, very little change in elevation movement on the tracking radars and verified by the computer dials.  The elevation was around 15 thousand feet.  We reported the UFO to the Battalion Operations Center which I believe had us to go to Battle Stations, if memory serves me).  When I realized that this was not a normal target but what I perceived to be an UFO, I turned on the Horizontal and Vertical Plotting Boards. The Horizontal Plotting Board showed the position of the tracked UFO, in azimuth and range as plotted by computer-controlled plot pens. The Vertical Plotting Board plotted the altitude of the target as well as the calculated time for missile interception should we be directed to fire.  I also turned on the Multi-Channel Data Recorder (MCDR) which recorded data of the entire engagement for later analysis.  The computer compared the position, course, altitude and speed of the UFO and in case we were directed to engage. After moving right and left the UFO stopped moving all together and started to go up in elevation (altitude).  It started slowly and then picked up speed.  In the end it was going up so fast in elevation that the Computer dials were just zinging and the numbers printed on the dials looked like a blur.  The tracking radars lost the UFO around somewhere around 100K feet and it was no longer displayed on the PPI.  It took about 5-10 seconds to reach that altitude.  After the event was over, the crew all agreed that it was probably a UFO.  We had never experienced such an unexplained target before or after this event. The next morning after our final 6 hour checks and adjustments and before we got off manning an Air Force Major (I think) and an Air Force Enlisted person showed up at the Interconnection building which provided entry to BC, RC and Maintenance vans.  They asked and received the Plotting Board papers and the Event Recorder paper and they left the tact site.   In summary, we never heard anything about this event.  This is why I am writing this paper after 52 years of wondering if our UFO event was documented somewhere and if not, I would like to submit this paper as proof that these events of that night on manning really happened as best as can recall.  This UFO event can be independently verified by the on-duty crewmembers who witnessed the events above and as well documented by the Plotting Board papers and the Event Recorder paper taken by the Air Force.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,,

My mother asked me to take out the paper trash to burn, we lived on a dead end street beside a very large swamp area and separated our paper to burn out back. We had a large mowed field next to our house before the swampy area started, we always burned our paper trash at the edge of it before where the ground got too wet. I reluctantly pulled myself away from the TV and ran out the back door grabbing the large paper grocery bag full of paper trash and a pack of matches. Planning to get this over with fast, I ran to the edge of the field, dropped the bag and flicked a few lit matches into it,waiting only a half second to make sure one would light the papers inside and ran back to the house eager to return to the new TV show. As i ran in my mother was still standing on the back porch holding open the screen door with her back,once i was in the kitchen but not yet to the living-room, and my TV show, my mother said ""greg,what IS that?""....I turned around and she was still standing on the back porch holding open the screen door,I walked to where she was and she stood gazing off into the darkening night sky,it was just after sunset, maybe 6 or 7 p.m. I looked to where she was looking and saw some flashing light in the distance and said  ""oh thats just a....."" (ready to dismiss whatever and go back to TV). Thats as far as i got, I realized it was not a plane..it was too low, and wobbling ,and the wrong colors and too slow...It was about a half mile away,at a spot where the nickle plate railroad tracks intersected with interstate 65. There was a viadock there where the highway went over the railroad tracks.From where we stood i could see the headlights from the traffic and this object just above all the cars and trucks. The viadock was made on 2 hills maybe 80 feet tall with a bridge over them so the train could pass underneath I-65 on its way thru the swamp.I-65 is pretty much north-south and the nickle-plate railroad that went under it was pretty much east-west. The object looked about the same distance above the traffic as the viadock is tall, making its altiutude about 160 feet. I stared a moment,thinking, before stepping down off the porch onto the driveway to escape the light from the kitchen and see it better,and also to move toward it a bit..let my eyes adjust to the dark,it was not a plane,too slow,too low,a helicopter? no sound, not a blimp, too fast... I realized rather quickly it did not fit any category of flying things I knew of. I stared at it intently , it had green, red and blue lights rotating around it, the 3 lights forming a triangle, and some whitish light..and they were pulsing not flashing, and it seemed to wobble forward kind of,due to the elliptical rotation of the triangle of lights,from a distance it looked like 2 steps forward one step back, but now it was closer and I could see that's how it moved, the center was sliding forward into the space between the center sphere and the outer rotating ring with the 3 lights mounted on it,as if you were walking while hoola-hooping, and each time the hoola-hoop was touching your back you would take a step forward..but it was a very smooth motion,and silent. It was headed our way,and as it got closer I felt an overwhelming sense of awe and wonder and inside I knew this was unidentified, and flying... and an object !....my heart was beating but I felt calm. Hoping it! was true but thinking any minute it would reveal itself to be a helicopter or something else mundane. It didn't, it came directly at me and then this huge craft silently floated directly above me and my yard and my house and was now so low I felt sure it intended on landing in the field next to our house (it wouldn't have fit). Looking straight up at its underside I could see now the center sphere had a larger unattached, or loosly attached, ring around it and the 3 colored lights were mounted on that rotating ring,I think I could see the night sky in the space between the sphere and the ring as it went around. I was thinking love and peace and I want to meet you, and let me see inside your ship..and it seemed to be in agreement as it approached,I squinted to look for windows in the center sphere, I think I saw some ports or something but they were small and blended with the surface, with all the glare and lights and it being night I could not be sure, but I did feel watched,from there . More than that I felt ""telepathy-ed at"" or heard.. or understood, or ""linked to"" whoever was there,inside.i felt in a dreamy state. It was almost as big as a football field,if anyone was really in it they were in the center part,it was about 80 feet up.It took up 30% of the visible sky.My neck was bent back as far as it would go to look up at it.I felt the same feeling you get when you daydream.It felt good,euphoric. It was going to land,I just knew it. It hovered there for 5 minutes or so, I felt euphoria and I had to concentrate hard to keep thinking clearly and study it, to remember everything, and not fall under its spell,it took effort,to keep 'snapping myself out of it'. The bottom seemed to be mirroring the night sky above it,like it tried to be invisible. I realized it was so close I could hit it with a rock!.. or my BB gun..or the 22 rifle behind our back door and make it crash here!..and call channel 7 eyewitness news and be famous!..and the very next rotation of that glorious ring rotated to the east, away from me...it was leaving!..they heard my thoughts! I was already regretting letting my thoughts go from 'peace,land,come here,i want to meet you' to 'get proof and be on TV'. I ran in the house and the gun was not behind the door where it ALWAYS is..I ran to the living room and yelled for my stepfather to come look, but he wasn't interested i ran past my mom and back outside. My mom was still frozen at the back door looking up with her mouth hanging open, I knew even then the euphoria had gotten to her,she was mesmerized. Back outside it was really leaving..it slowly did its rotate slide, rotate slide to the east, away from me and my chance to meet them, I blew it. It slowly hoola-hooped due east and back over I-65 again, about mile north of where It first crossed west over the interstate, and disappeared into the distance. I felt sad as i watched it another 15 minutes floating away. I didn't know what to do,I called state police,they said nobody has reported anything,that left me with not much to say,I tried calling a small local airport but nobody answered.It was so low,going over I-65 and all the neighborhoods,willow street,old ridge road,surely someone else saw it,all west Hobart should have seen that thing,surely anyone outdoors between ridgeview elementary school and I-65. For the next week I watched the news and read the post tribune looking for anything, nothing. I was never the same after that,maybe there really is a God, I didnt know everything or have a logical explanation for everything anymore. After all these years I have come to some conclusions. It was held aloft the same way a magnet is when held over another magnet with matching poles facing each other- I could ""feel it""..it was not anti-gravity,it was suspended inside the earths magnetic field somehow, it was manipulating the magnetic fields around itself,silent,smooth, efficient. But it had lights even tho it seemed to try to broadcast the night sky on its' underside., why cloak itself but have bright pulsing lights..why would aliens need or care to follow FAA regulations or any earth laws..why have lights at all if you want to sneak?  Was it trying to look like our air traffic? Why come out of your way to look at me and hang out here and let me see you if you are trying to cloak yourself? Did it see the flashes from me throwing matches in the garbage, it surely went out of its way to come over here and look at me. It did not want some normal plane or something to crash into it,thats why the lights..thats the only thing that makes sense, or maybe it was just taken for granted when building it that of course anything flying, at night especially, needs lights..right? ..by humans this logic holds. I was amazed at the technology of that thing, hundreds of years ahead of mankind if not more!..but i think the lights were man-made,and the more i think about it the more i think it was a ufo for sure, but not from distant space,it was too ""mechanical"". I doubt that thing could make it from one star system to another no matter how amazing it was compared to a jet or helicopter. Maybe the original idea or some tech inside it was from outer space, but we were the ones who had it now, reverse engineered. We were the ones ""hundreds of years ahead of man kind""... now after seeing the tic tacs with the pacific fleet, in comparison my old 1973 ufo seems like an old fashioned clunky version, almost a laughable funny flying machine, like how we now look at old black and white movies of early attempts at flight. Maybe the telepathy thing was just my emotional state. Maybe.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,41.5179,-87.2353

We were north of Las Cruces, NM  and south of Soccoro, NM when a bright beam of light suddenly appeared over our car. We immediately assumed it was a helicopter from the US Border patrol.  We pulled to the side of the road, expecting a patrol car to come up for identifications. We turned off our motor and sat in the car for a few minutes. No vehicle of any kind appeared.  Having recently returned from two years in South Korea with the US Army, we were very aware of the sounds of flying vehicles. We then realized that we did not hear the sounds which are made by a helicopter. As it was early in the morning, there was no other traffic in either direction.  We got our of the car and looked up at the light. A bright column extended as far up as we could see and we could not determine a source or end of the light. The beam surrounded us to about three feet complete! ly around the car. Again, the most amazing aspect was absolute silence. Not even the air was disturbed so no wind. We stool there fascinated by the sight when suddenly the light simply vanished. And no sound of a flying vehicle departing. We got back in our car and continue our trip to Albuquerque. There was no unaccounted for time other than the 15-20 minutes we observed the light.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,32.32767214076246,-106.75489560117302

As we passed a jetty I noticed what I thought was a duck sitting on a jetty in the dark,  I don't know if this had anything to do with this sighting or not I've never till this day worked it out.  As we passed the jetty I noticed a dark dusk hovering silently from this jetty area toward us as we paddled the boat.  It seemed to quickly hover over the back of the boat then down lower toward the water and my friend paddled his heart out till we eventually made it to mangrove trees and we sat in the boat for a while then paddled home. As silly as this all sounds it was quite terrifying and I never really spoke to my friend since but one night I mentioned it while we were having drinks at a club when I ran into him about 10yrs later , he was short and he left.  I wanted him to laugh and say it was our imagination but he was like offended. This actual thing we saw was only about 3ft in diameter and would of been 6 or 8 inches high. It was perfectly flat on the bottom and  the top rose from the edges to about 6"" high in the centre. A kind of rounded top compared to a ridiculously flat under part. I state that because I know flat is flat but this just looked perfect, it's one of the most outstanding parts I remember , and the under part or bottom seemed to have lights but not lights like I know it was more strange like those photo development room lights and seemed more to be just changing its brightness from a dull to a brighter dull kind of light. It was absolutely silent yet I could here a noise and I can't explain that noise it was more of a thing my head or body felt than a noise but it was there while this thing was there.Kind of like a silent buzzing noise but with absolutely no sound at all if that makes sense. It flew in a quick speed to approach is and could basically hover under complete control. It was so odd that I can only say it was like a miniature typical flying saucer type object and the fact it was so small made it even more harder to speak about , I told my mother and a few friends and never mentioned it again. I still to this day remember this as it was yesterday. I know I could be hypnotised and I would state the exact thing as I've written here. When we sat hiding in the mangroves I knew it was hovering and it may of even been present at a distance when we finally came out and rushed home but all I wanted to do was get home and not see this again. If it was yesterday I would out it down to a drone but the fact we both saw this and didn't even speak much during the event we still both saw this. It was dark but the flying thing seemed so flat on the bottom and tapered on the top , it was perfect like a person had just built it with some kind of material that was brand new and absolutely perfect all over. It was dark but I still saw all of this .It was similar to a polished peice of art or something strange that I just had never seen and haven't since. This appearance was the main amazing part. Not the fact that it was a weird thing hovering around us that scared us both but it's the perfect looking dimensions and materials etc that do my head in. How basic can a discription of a saucer like UFO be? But this is not the case as basic as it sounds it wasn't like that.It made a silent noise I could feel and I've never ever felt anything like that.The closest thing to that feeling but still very far away was when lightning struck a power box 40ft or so from me as I sat watching a storm .It was like I felt the power of the electricity coming as it hit the power pole and b! ox. It was like my body could feel all that power as it struck. I know that this all sounds ridiculous but after all these years I wanted to share it , I'm not great at explaining things either and may have left out areas that make sense and happy to answer questions. I know you probably also don't get reports of little things flying around silent either. With lights that aren't like normal lights so all sounds silly but I know what I saw and I'd love to say it was the size of a football field but it wasn't. I know this thing had detected us and was observing us and I don't know what the fuck had to do with it , it was a large white European goose like thing but I mentioned it because it was there too.It was dark but our eyes would get used to dark we never carried lights or torches , there would have had to have been at least a semi part of the moon in the sky to give some light to the dark but all in all it was night.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,,

It was so low, that my immediate thought was that a plane was about to crash. I stepped outside and saw a large low flying object just above the treetops.  It was slowly making it's way around my house.  I have a vacant lot next to my house so there was easy access to get by me.  It was then I realized I was witnessing something out of the ordinary so I ran in to get my phone camera.  I also turned the front porch light out so I could see better.  I think there were green, red and blue lights.  The object was either triangle, square or round.  I couldn't tell with the lights were flashing. It continued alongside my house slowly and low to the ground and crossed the river.  At this point, I  was a little nervous and went back inside and watched from the back door.  My back patio is on the Delaware River.  The Delaware River separates New Jersey from Pennsylvania. So, I'd be curious to know if anyone in Easton, Palmer, Forks, Bangor, Wind Gap, Pa area, had seen anything.  I can't emphasize enough at how slow moving the object was.  This passage from my front window around my house was 4 or 5 minutes.  I had gone in and out of my house 3 times during the time the object made its way around. One more thing, in the past when I had heard about sightings, people speak of whirling or silence.  I did hear some time of motor, but wouldn't describe it as whirling.

Being November it was very dark. We were in the middle of town at a park. There was light pollution around us but we were still very able to see stars in the sky. Many of them. I was with my daughter, she was on a piece of playground equipment, I looked up to her from the ground as I was chasing her around the playground playing tag. It was a very very dark. As I stare up  at her something flies out from behind her head, something up in the sky. I was immediately stupefied. From my perspective it appeared massive. From my perspective it appeared massive. Unreasonably large. Oppressively large. Stop you in your tracks dead large. Doesn’t belong in the sky large. All I could say to her was ‘Look..’ and I pointed. She turned around and I saw her body froze immediately when she saw it and was also stupefied. I was generally facing east and it was flying to the east by south east. I don’t know what it was. It’s speed, it’s absolute silence, it’s perceived massive! size weren’t the concerning or alarming part.  The absolutely unsettling part about it was how it appeared, I don’t mean how it arrived, I mean how it looked. I will do my best to describe the shape but when you understand how it appears you’ll understand you are not able to see it’s shape. I am a grown man, I fought in three wars, i’ve seen horrible things... I have never witnessed something that froze me in my place. The appearance of this thing is terrifying. We left the park immediately, I called the police for god sake, and the Air Force Base.  I am unable to determine if it was very large and very far away, or somewhat smaller and closer. Regardless, it was very fast and absolutely silent. It flew anywhere from 100 yards overhead to maybe half a kilometer. What was shocking about it was that you could not see it. It appeared to be so massive. This is difficult to describe but I will attempt to paint a clear picture. I couldn’t tell if it was a wing shape, or if it was like a bell on its side, or like the USPS logo. It was invisible but you could see it. Imagine looking up at the sky, seeing stars everywhere, now cut out the shape of some sort of wing-bell-wedge shape and move it across the sky. It had stars on its surface. Bright stars. It’s like there was a television in the sky with a camera behind it showing me the stars. As the television moves the camera shows the stars behind the television. But for whatever reason the television stopped working and the stars were frozen in place on the surface of whatever i! t was. Does that make sense? It was like it had moving camouflage but the camouflage stopped moving. It was so massive that its movement was absolutely apparent. It looked like someone took a photo of the sky, with stars, and wrapped it around an airplane.  It was too close. It wasn’t an accident, it wasn’t like a crash or something. It was right where it wanted to be and it was moving right above us and headed to my right. It was totally silent.  It wasn’t something like you see on television, it wasn’t a far away dot or a trash can floating two miles away. It was a car, a house, or a cruise ship sized object. It was so large that you almost could feel it’s movement, imagine looking up and seeing a blue whale flying over your head through the bottom of an aquarium. But it was invisible. You could see the stars through it but for some reason the stars on its surface froze or stopped moving and when they did it exposed the movement of this massive hulking monolithic vague shape of moving stars cruising just over head.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,39.01482293577982,-94.28685825688073

It was not the wind. You cannot hear the sound in our video.  I believe it had almost like a tubular rocket “nose, part,” but the shape was kind of a triangle.  My friend and I paused our conversation. I said “I’m sorry, but what is that? I thought it was a plane, but...” she cut me off to agree and said “I have been wondering the same thing.

The sight of this massive football shaped UFO with these 3 huge lights passing across my windshield caused me to immediately stop.

I fixated on the 3 lights and that's when I detected a very slight wobble.

We were headed to different colleges in Sept so this was a kind of departing trip - the end of High School and the start of a new chapter in life. During the days we would hang out at the river, hike around, fish, etc. But at night we would go to a bench next to the railroad tracks because the stars were visible. Yes, we would drink and carry on until well drunk, like normal 18 year old boys.  I want to emphasize we were completely sober during the sighting.  The night of sighting, just as the sun had set, we started walking to the bench. The path took us alongside the creek, over a bridge, and then a footpath through the forest. We were chatting and walking through the forest which was quite dense with tall Douglas fir. The path through the forest ended with the clearing made for the railroad tracks. The tracks were on a raised gravel berm of sorts with about 10feet of gravel on either side, then another 10 feet or so of dirt.  My friend was walking ahead of me and just as we entered the clearing, he stopped abruptly. I actually ran into him gently as he stared. I was literally looking over his shoulder. We both looked up and it seemed like there was some kind of giant black object or shape in front of us. I can’t say anything about the contours or dimensions but something massive was in front of us. The object then accelerated instantly to something like 1,000 mph are shot southwards down the tracks in under half a second. The curvature of the tracks in this mountainous area was such the trains in that area move at a crawl. Some have suggested it could have been a runway train but that is simply not possible - nor did it sound anything like a train which makes a clack-clack-clack sound. Whatever it was seemed to be hovering above the tracks and when it became aware of our presence and shot away instantly.  It did not make any wind that I can recall, but I felt an incredible low-frequency vibration in my body, like a deep bass note at a concert. Also, the fencing and other outbuildings further down the tracks shook with this low frequency energy as it zipped off - the craft itself did not seem to make any noise but the rumble vibrated everything on each side of it.  It was terrifying and we ran back to the cabin. We didn't really understand when it was happening that this was a UFO.

A huge tract of land was split into 5 and 10 acre lots and sold.  The land was located on Honey Creek Road starting  where it intersects with GA Hwy 212, and Tucker Mill Road which runs at an angle behind Honey Creek Road.  The land was heavily forested with pines and hardwoods.  We purchased 5 acres and were the first to build in that whole area. This sighting took place when there were no other homes around.  A little after 10 pm in June of 1979 my husband and I were sitting on the screened porch on the right side of our home.  There was a transformer on a pole at the edge of our lot, approximately 100 feet straight across from the porch.  Rockdale County, at that time, was the holding pattern for planes waiting to land at the Atlanta Airport.  It was very common to see a bright flash of light and look up to see a plane's headlights.  That evening I saw that bright flash of white light.  I looked up expecting to see the usual.  But - - there were round amber lights coming in LOW over the tree tops into our side yard.  All I could see was 2 amber lights coming straight towards me.  I heard a clicking or popping noise, not loud at all.  The lights moved over to the transformer where I could distinctly see three or four round amber lights the size of portholes.  The lights were in a row that wrapped around the craft.  It hovered over the transformer and the amber lights went out.  As it hovered, the craft leveled out and I could then see a silver bottom.  It appeared to be a round craft, or possibly an oval one.  I would guess it was maybe 25 feet long.  It hovered silently over the transformer for maybe 2 minutes.  The clicking had stopped.  Then suddenly there was a bright flash of white light and the craft was gone.  Totally disappeared.  It made no sound.  I turned to my husband and said ""Did you see that!!!""   He had been dozing and did not see anything!  I told him I had just seen a UFO and described it.  We walked out onto the stoop attached to the porch and looked up at the sky. There was a bright pink, circular light in a low cloud over our home.  I would describe it as being the size of a full moon, or a little larger.  He said ""Let's get inside"".  We went in, locked the door, and I called the Rockdale County Sheriff's office and asked if they had any reports of UFO's that night.  She said no, but give us a call if you see it again.  Then within maybe 5 minutes our lights went out.  They were not out long.  Maybe 3 minutes.  But we were frightened.  I just needed to tell someone.  I have told family and friends over the years, but not UFO authorities.  There was no loss of time, or any indication we had been seen or taken.

My boyfriend and a friend of ours were with me. During a break I was standing outside having a cigarette when I noticed a light above the horizon. It was full dark and the light was bright enough to catch my attention but not so bright as to stand out particularly. I became aware that the light I saw was reflecting blue and red. It was like the colored lights were on too of a disc that was tilting upwards periodically and obscuring the lights. I was trying to figure out whether the lights were from a satellite or perhaps from Venus. I am not an astronomer and have no expertise in this field. I was joined by my friend and boyfriend. After a few minutes on of them also remarked on the odd colored item in the sky. I acknowledged that I saw it too and we began to discuss what it might be. All of a sudden the object grew brighter and performed a zig zag maneuver at! a high rate of speed. I asked if they had seen that and what it could be. As we continued to watch we could see more clearly the rim of a curved edge tilting upward periodically and obscuring red and blue cycling lights. If it weren't for the shape and bizarre movements I would have said it was a plane. But this thing hung motionless I. The sky except for the waxing as nd waning of the light. It made additional zig zagging maneuvers as we watched for maybe three minutes. It then dropped straight down below the horizon and disappeared. A couple of seconds later two military jets flew over the area in a criss-crossing pattern.,2021-08-16T00:00:00,46.75618648648649,-117.33531981981983

All of the lights were off in the house and nobody else was home. My house sat at the edge of a massive empty field that once was a location of the towns Drive-In Theater.  I did what I normally did, which was to go straight to my basement where I watched movies and played games. My cat, follows me down the dark stairway. I turn on the corner lamp next to the bar, by the back door. What happened next, I'll never forget…  The memory is clear as water in my mind. The cat wanders over to the shades, and I can see her staring contently through the glass and flipping her tail in that irritated manner, grumbling at something in the dark.I went to the sliding glass doors, unlocked and slid it open by half.  As she went out to the porch, I turned on the porch light. I stuck my neck out the doorway to take a glance around the yard, and immediately notice a ring of lights gleaming beyond the threshold, in the back right corner of my yard and the field beyond. Partially obscured by a single tree. I thought, maybe a flatbed truck back there?? That's all it could possibly be! Very quickly, this craft reacts to my sudden presence and began it's instant departure.  I believe it took notion to leave when my lights came on, but instead of driving off down through the grass, it lifted up into the air. I remember gazing I'm awe. It was silent, minus the low level hum it emitted. At this point, I'm nearly shitting my pants, and remember being worried about my cat outside. I jump behind the wall and unplug the lamp, so I couldn't be seen watching what it (the vessel) was doing. As I lean back to the doorway, I slide it shut. I'm nervous. Now, the UFO started to lift over my neighbors house, and this was when I could affectively step out and judge it's size.  It was similar in size to their middle class style 3BR. It never sped off, but slowly hovered over their roof and down the road out of my view. It's gone. At this point, I'm freaked out, thinking... ""They dropped one of em off"". So I run inside, lock the doors, lights off. I literally hid in the corner behind the bar for about 20min.  I started thinking about alien sightings from the 50s and 60s and assuming this would be a typical visiting spot, given it's history as a Drive-in. If I was an alien or a spy.. and wanted to observe humans, I'd have taken advantage of such sights that a theater would provide and kept the coordinates on file. If the lights were off, the vessel could be hidden from view due to its highly reflective sheen of chrome, and sleek design.  This particular vessel, looked highly similar to the disk types, that we originally saw on television and such. I thought it would have been much bigger, as it seemed only large enough to fly one or two bodies somewhere in the center of the craft. It could have been a remote vehicle, with no pilot, as well. However, many others have reported that these smaller ones drop out of larger ones, which is likely.  There were several hues of dim pulsating marker lights around the outer rim. These lights, btw, seemed a little outdated for an alien craft. For a moment, I thought this was a government drone because of that single detail. This rim is also part of the vessel that spins as it lifts off. It seemed to be traveling from vacuum rather than propulsion. I couldn't be sure, only speculation.  Did I believe in aliens back then? Well, im not sure. It was Y2K. I kicked around on an Alien Workshop skateboard in my teens, drew their logo on paper a few times... but that's about the jest of my interest. I grew up watching X-files, but the production gave the subject matter a step into straight fiction. But I do remember trying to justify that I just saw a real UFO, and without a doubt... just 30-40yrds away from view.  Wasn't much longer, when the family was also arriving home. I tried emailing places I found on the internet a few times since (to tell my story) - with no response or further interest… not that I had much else to report on the matter. I never told my friends or family from fear of ridicule, as it was all deemed ""taboo"" to that generation.  Now, I'm pretty open about it, and people actually believe my account of the event. I'm pretty sure there aren't many ""landing sightings"", on record. So I thought I'd share mine.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,38.1103,-78.9073

It was hazardous because there was snow banks still on either side of the highway which didn’t leave much room for 3 young guys to walk.  Not to mention the risk of getting stopped by local police which would most likely stop us to ask what we were doing, where we were going etc.    the Bear Basin turn off was a mile away and we just had to make it to there.

We are not friends. I don’t mean to be rude, but I’ve been harassed about the UFO issue for quite some time.  I lived in Washington, DC and attended a top law school.  I have narcolepsy I, and I have severe sleep disturbances.  One night, a group of men appearing to be military climbed through a window into my apartment on about the eighth floor across from the Army Navy country club.  The entered the window and kneeled, while another entity presumably supposed to be an “alien” entered the window.  It was a scary entity and leaned over me, choking me and appeared to change phase from a human form to an electric current.  It held the expression of what looked like “The Scream” painting famous in popular culture.  I remember one of the military members wore a ski mask and flashed a code of arms.  The code of arms appeared to be foreign, but I can’t determine whether or not the military members were American or foreign.  I have a friend who listens to popular radio, and suggested they might have been the “alien greys.”  All of this was extremely amusing, but my narcolepsy worsened after the incident, and my health declined rapidly.  I was forced to leave law school, and I was arrested twice for petty misdemeanor crimes.  Even though I did not really engage in criminal behavior and could not drink alcohol with my narcolepsy medication.  This didn’t seem like a UFO experience at all in my opinion. It looked like a prank or a joke since I’m a somewhat intelligent, young female in DC.  I graduated from a high school, where strangers harass students (e.g., flashers, strange harassments at home, etc.). We are forced to ignore the harassment.  In my case, I got really sick though, and I had to recover gradually taking menial jobs that were below my level of expertise.  Only because my narcolepsy was extremely bad, I gained 120 pounds, and I went to several different doctors in a variety of different specialties to see what I needed to do physically.  I suffer from hair pulling and some OCD after the incident now, so I’m probably not the best witness to testify.  I just keep going, hoping someone determines who is harassing us.  My instincts told me it WAS American.  The coat of arms was either foreign or related to a branch of the military.  I was harassed at home about ten years later after telling this story to people for years as a joke.  A former military member and local judge tried to extort money from me using his girlfriend.  I have no idea who these people are, and after reporting it, they are pretending it is some type of military operation.  I wake up in other locations all of the time after going to bed, but I always end up in my final spot at home where I began.  I do have narcolepsy, so I think that might have been an impetus to harass me as if aliens were after me or as if I were abducted by aliens.  The “alien” did try to choke me instituting a cardiac arrest.  I often wake up lying down and it feels like I’m flying.  My hope is that maybe someone has discovered a way to promote long distance travel, because you could do so theoretically by instituting the cardiac arrest and then freezing the body at subzero temperatures.  That discovery would be a cool thing to come out of this.  The most obvious explanation to me is that I might have been a potential litigant in a law suit.  I worked in the legal field.  I cannot confirm this detail however. I have also worked in security professionally.  Now, for some reason, there are about ten songs on mass radio distribution that appear to be my work from my car studi! o.  I have not been paid for writing the songs in mass distribution, and I'm not involved.  It sounds like more harassment.  I am not aware of any lawsuit I would have been a part of that would have challenged the military though, and I wanted to finish law school, even with narcolepsy, hearing, and vision impediments.  When I woke up the next day, my cat was struggling to hang onto me and was trying to calm me down in a really bizarre fashion.  I've never experienced that from an animal before.  Lately, someone is pretending a series of events that occurred to me in 2005 are happening now.  They're pretending they did not occur in San Antonio, Texas (Alamo Heights).  They are pretending what I contended happened is occurring now for some reason.  I can still hear my songs on radio play, but have not been compensated.  Sorry if I don't sound more reliable, but you can finish law school with a hearing impediment.  This was just stupid, and I have no idea what started it.  I'! ll ignore and continue on.

It was a nice piece of property  though we did not live there after November 1980 because we moved back to Jacksonville so my Dad could near his Physician as he had a severe heart condition. In January 1980, I was upstairs in my room one afternoon and I was rearranging my bedroom furniture. This is an important point because if I had not moved my bed against the north wall like I did I would never have known about or seen this unidentified object that night as I sat on my bed writing a letter to a college friend. I happened to look out the window and I thought I saw something. I turned off all the lights and went directly to this window and through the tree branches was an object with red lights on it and it moved to where it was directly across from me but on the other side of the bare tree branches. It was January so of course there weren’t any leaves or vegetation on this tree. I was totally floored. It moved and had red lights. It was NOT a weather balloon. I know what weather balloons look like and this was small and from what I could tell the shape was kind of a cylinder possibly. Anyway, if I moved, it would move. What really bothered me was that it was there all night every night. I first noticed it about mid-January 1980 and no matter what it was there! every night. No, I didn’t tell Dad because of his heart condition and my Mom had just lost her own Mother to cancer and she was also working on her Master’s Degree at the time but something else stopped me from saying anything to anyone until now: Would anyone have believed me? Frankly, I have always thought that it was some kind of a camera. I kidd you not. Since it was on our property, it was NOT a telephone pole with lights, for example. And besides, this thing moved as if by remote control and it was ALWAYS THERE. I do not drink or smoke and did not drink or smoke in college because I’m allergic to various kinds of alcohol and I never picked up smoking because of what it had done to Dad. Therefore, I was not “seeing things”.  Does anyone have any kind of idea why it was keeping tabs on me like that because that is what it seemed like? In fact, it could have been tracking me possibly during the daytime as well and I had no idea it was doing this. I did go outside in broad daylight a few times and looked on the other side of this tree up in the branches but saw nothing. It showed up at night just as it was getting dark. It scared me to death because I fail to see what could be so interesting, but if it was indeed an Alien operated remote controlled camera of some sort it would not surprise me to have my hunch confirmed because Elon Musk recently said that they are studying us and are subtle. I would welcome any learned thoughts on this nightly occurrence outside my bedroom window. Gee, I hope no one laughs at me.  Thank You.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,39.6287,-90.461

Hovering at about 500 feet (very low) Following East along the North side of the highway In Daylight as clear as it gets  Just outside of Whiteman Air Force Base (Where the Nuclear Bombers are kept)  There was A LOT of military convoys on the highway that day I believe the UFO's may have been following the military convoys heading East towards St. Louis  The UFO's looked just like the ""Front Circle"" of the Star Trek Enterprise But Gunmetal Grey, Smooth, and No Lights  For most of the LONG CLEAR sighting... There was only 1 Flying Saucer by itself for 20 minutes  The single UFO was joined by 2 more Flying Saucers that almost instantly appeared But i could tell the 2 came from the west (KC) because of a visual ""stretched"" ""Tracer"" ""streak"" across the sky that could only be created by something traveling near light speed (or EXTREMELY FAST)  The 3 Saucers hovered (slowly traveling East along I-70 i guess around 60 mph) in a Triangle formation for about 20 minutes  3 black helicopters (assuming from AFB) flew in and circled the 3 UFO's for about 10 minutes  Then all 3 UFO's then shot west in an instant (not up... straight west) leaving a visual streak of the UFO's in the direction they flew (West back towards KC)  The Helicopters stuck around for a few minutes then flew back west towards the AFB  Once the helicopters were gone for a bit... The 3 UFO's shot back from the west, and once again hovered in a triangle formation for about 10 minutes  Then 2 of the UFO's shot straight north (not up, but north towards Canada) Leaving a visual tracer from their speed  The 3rd UFO stayed solo along the I-70 for 5 minutes then shot North (NOT up, but North) in the same direction of the 2 UFO's  These UFO's were clearly, EXTREMELY advanced technology 1000's of years in the future  I could go into more detail in a phone call  I witnessed all of this sitting in the back seat driver's side of a station wagon looking slightly up and back out the passenger window in what would be considered the ""Blind Spot"" of a car driver and up.  I freaked out when I first saw the Solo UFO I tried to get my family to look... I was pounding my finger on the window yelling ""LOOK!!!"" (that's all I could say)  but my abusive step dad swung his hand back and slapped me in the face (So I KNOW i was awake lol) and told me to shut the f#k up I was already in trouble for kicking the back of his seat lol  All I could do was watch by myself (with tears in my eyes for a few minutes) i couldn't tell anybody in the car what i was witnessing out of fear of getting hit again  This sighting was 100% Legit... and I am 100% legit",2021-03-02T00:00:00,38.7662,-93.5655

On one of this occasions as I was looking for the kite I came upon a strange site in the sky. I saw multiple dots in the sky approximately one dot surrounded by about eight dots. At first I thought that they where air crafts, for the reason that my parents live close to LAX and there is an air route over head.

In my mind I thought they where aircraft as I use to observe them during my time as an Air Traffic Controller at a tower. But the cluster of dots did not move or change pater, then i thought that it was a combination of planes and aircraft in the distance but they would still not move. After about half an hour I decided to look for my camera to use the zoom lens to see if I could identify the dots.

I started to scan the sky to look for the dots that where originally in a circle but I found that  the dots started to skater. I attempted to use the focus on the camera but the dots would not come in to focus. Eventually I took some pictures but all I can see are dots in the sky being skater.

The clouds were slightly gray but white, not too low but they were lower clouds. I remember there were electrical power lines above the road, more than the usual. Trees start clumping up on the tops as the trees get bigger so, when I saw this thing it came in and out of sight behind the trees straight ahead sometimes. Edit: Larger trees that had leaves in them were overhead sometimes.  So I was driving on a two lane road, route 1. I swear it was one left and one right, only my lane and the oncoming traffic lane. It was slightly overcast. I remember seeing a dark blur at first, like I had to look a few times thinking what is this. It made no sense because it was traveling at my speed, I could see it behind the clouds moving with just about my speed. It was about maybe, 1/2 of a mile away, maybe closer, could have been 3/4 mile. I'm guessing at about a 25 degree angle viewing angle up, just slightly up. It was visible in and out of the whispy clouds, kind of like I guess it felt like the thing was hiding just above the clouds. I didn't truly see a shape because the clouds were puffy around it, but it may have been semi-rounded underneath, possibly taller on the top, maybe more rugged, I don't remember, but I thought, there weren't any mountains around there, there's no way in hell it was a plane, and no way in hell I was seeing things, it wasn't dark clouds ! on top of white clouds, it was too dark and solid looking to be a natural anomaly. It was going at my speed, and I saw it may have gone forward or back. The trees would come overhead and I'd lose track of it, but the trees cleared and I could see it again after a few moments. At the end of this I saw it accelerate forward away from me with the ground as the level, not straight away like shooting striaght, but along the curvature of the earth. It zipped so fast, it, must have been going away at hundreds of miles per hour, like, we're talking mach 2, 3 maybe, and it was slightly gradual at first. I wanted to say 300, 400 miles per hour, but I've seen cars going 300 mph like on a bughatti test run, like for the distance it was from me at 1/2 - 3/4 miles away in the sky, this thing, it wouldn't make sense for it to be going less than mach 3, maybe even mach 4, I'd say the size of this thing although mostly obscured, feels like about the size of maybe 2 1/2 home depots large in ! width for the distance, maybe wider. If you placed 4 quarters ! lengthwi se left to right at arms length from you, that's the size. It was just very smoothly going in and out of view with the clouds, and I remember feeling very scared, like I was seeing a ufo, imagining, what could it do. my heart was pumping a little bit stronger. I remember going, holy fuck, no way, no fucking way.  There were no lights, nothing. It simply puffed out of the clouds, could have been, 100 feet inside of the clouds, maybe more I don't know. It was a dark/black object, no real shape from what I remember, no angles, no nothing it just felt very very very subtly metallic underneath, some of the cloud white may have reflected off of it very slightly if anything at the center of it, maybe edges, a slight frosty reflection. It didn't move left or right, up or down, simply forward and back slightly, then zipped off. Must have been anywhere from 18 to 40 seconds time I was seeing it. Only people I've told about this was my mom in the car, maybe my father later. No pictures, didn't hear anything. I remember a car behind me was not too close, maybe 4 1/2 seconds behind me, felt like they were seeing it too maybe. I remember when there were now 4 lanes I looked at them passing me, and they didn't look at me.  I don't remember if my mom saw it too or not, just asked her on my text message at 12 am pacific when she's 3 am eastern so. I don't remember where we were driving to but we have driven that road many many times for two hours up and down from Richmond, VA to DC.

We were both sober and relaxed, and the night was basically clear with a trace of mist coming off the ocean. As we sat in the car looking south over Nantucket Sound and chatting I spotted a light that was quite large and bright and lowish on the horizon. As we watched, somewhat idly, it grew larger and more pronounced and slowly approached us. As it drew closer we perceived that it was a triangular-shaped craft, dully metallic, with no discernible rivets, markings or windows. It was! indubitably one single, physical, coherent object, roughly 30 ft wide by 40 ft long, and its undercarriage contained three bright yellowish-white lights at the corners and a large red light in the middle. No light was emitted or shone elsewhere; rather, the lights appeared self-contained and pulsated and swirled like liquid. The strange object made absolutely no sound whatsoever (we had exited the car to observe it) and simply floated slowly over us and headed northward,elegant and silent as a great blue heron. We were awestruck as opposed to fearful, although I recall a twinge of anxiety, since it was a mere 50-100 feet above us. We briefly considered calling the police or the local airport but didn’t wish to be scoffed at or mocked. I have thought of it many times since and recently looked up my old friend in order to discuss it with him; unfortunately, I discovered he had passed away.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,41.6872,-69.9794

I have never reported it or told many people, not because of their reaction, but because it scares me, and I'm scared that acknowledging it will cause it to happen again or some kind of different event.  My hands are sweating even drafting this up..  It's pretty straight forward.  I was outside looking up at the sky.  I've watched the sky since I can remember. Since very little watching for shooting stars etc.  It was dark.  My first thought was maybe it was geese but it quickly changed.  I saw the point first.  It looked like a satellite.  It wasn't flashing like a plane.  But also was too low to be a satellite, too far to be geese. And then more followed, in the shape of a V.  I thought ok not geese, maybe airplanes, fighter jets flying together? UNTIL it just flat out STOPPED.  And after being stopped they all crossed in different directions.  One on the lower left went extremely quickly to the upper right but way out passed where the one was on the upper right.  One on the right zoomed over to the left but way out of formation.  They all did this and were able to just INSTANTLY stop in spots after going so incredibly fast, and then go in a totally different location and stop.  Until they were all out of the v formation at random spots and then all took off into different directions.  A few even zig zagged a couple times across the v formation that they showed up in but had the precision to just up and stop at these random spots in the sky, and then go in a totally different direction, stop, and then they all took off outward in different directions.  No smoke trails. No flashing lights.  Like that stay white satellite color when they are really far away, but this wasn't that far away...  Scariest thing I've ever seen.

Traffic was light to moderate, roads were dry.  Pictures were taken looking west,  while traveling north.  As I was driving home I took a bunch of pictures of the beautiful sunset. I take many photos while driving, just click away and then look later and hope some came out okay.  Well, last night I took many shots and when I got home to check if any of them were good, I noticed 13 of them have strange tiny lights in sky amongst the clouds. I will try to describe some of them below.   The first one has little group of them 2 oblong type, then bit below that small orb, to the right a strange cluster of an orb with little ones around it or a ""trail"". (all white in color.) (I had to zoom in to really see this one, I thought it was a star)  The next picture (you really have to zoom in to see) a white orb with very faint one next to it... and the to the far right edge two together, one faint and one slightly colored red/orange? and the a bit to the right of that is another small one orb. I thought these must be stars too?  The next photo 3 now has from the left side near the top 3 oblong objects in a row, one on top the other equal spaced and same size, also that faint red/orange color, mid photo lower in the clouds another small faint red/orange oblong object and just below that the large white orb now brighter with a white ""tail"" or long white line below it.  Photo 4, again still in the clouds up high in middle, blurry white orb, then below that the large white orb (looks covered by some cloud) and orange lit something directly next to it.  Just below these are a small cluster of 5? smaller lights/orbs.  Photo 5 center towards the top of picture in clouds, same bright orb with small orange and 2 tiny white orbs under it.  Just below that cluster is a tiny cluster of bright orbs, and what looks to be about 11 all lined up.  All of the first 11 pictures are timed stamped 1704 hr.  The last 2 photos, in middle towards the top in almost clear sky now, 3 tiny bright white objects, might be orbs but not quite round. This picture is time stamped 1706 hr.  I did not see any of these things while I was actually driving, I just held my phone and clicked away when there was an nice open shot for my sunset. There were buildings and trees blocking the shot before my 6th picture.  There is one picture that is the real ""first"" picture, which has nothing in it just the beautiful sunset, and the next ones have all these lights and things in it. I love taking photos, and this is not anything I have ever seen in my life.  It is not the common glare or spots I sometimes get. I have double checked my truck to see if any of the lights match or can reproduce what's seen, I have no lights that face my side driver window to cause a reflection. I have double checked my phone to see if the follow up pictures had any smudges or glares that caused any ""orbs"", all met with negative results.

The airplanes seemed to actually be flying higher than this unknown object, and yet we could still make out their blinking lights.

Without slowing it appeared to stop “on a dime” as they say, directly in front of me, more or less over North Street, and then shot directly westward without making a sound or leaving a trail.

So we were sitting there and a ball of light about the size if a volley ball floated in through the window, through the metal screen.It looked kind of solid almost like an old fashioned light bulb. We could clearly see the inside looked almost like a faint sparkler. It stopped, changed directions and headed towards my brother. My mother yelled at him and pulled him away. It stopped and went straight back out the metal screen leaving no marks and floated off.   From that day forward all 4 if us have had very bad dreams.  Mine is of a solid gray black wall that almost looks like stone.  I physically feel magnetic. Like pushing to magnets together the wrong way.  They stopped pretty much when i became an adult but every once in awhile out of nowhere i will get the feeling.  Even in the daytime. The rest dreamed pretty much the same but different shaped.  Always the same feeling. When i do get the feeling its also a feeling of dread and anxiety. Im now 47 yrs old.  I was watching one of these popular alien shows on tv a few weeks ago and low and behold they talked about a huge round glowing sphere over out state around the same time as our experience. They claimed people said hundreds of small spheres cane off the big one and flew away. After i saw that show i had to tell my story. I will never forget this. I know it want ball lightening.

My house sat directly at the bottom of the western foothills of Santa Teresa County Park in a small cul de sac between Bernal Middle School and the Norred/Mine Trailheads off of Heaton Moor.  My friend and I had taken my dog to Bernal middle school to skateboard on the large blacktop area near the baseball field and open grass area the school had. My dog was chasing us around, we could hear the sound of the neighborhood, cars driving around, neighboring houses playing music etc. Everything was completely normal. My dog began barking in the western direction towards (what we thought at the time) the houses that had backyards whose fences lined the blacktop area and field areas.  I was attempting to calm him when I noticed in the clear blue sky above us a large pure white cloud was moving quickly over the western foothills and crossing the valley that San Jose is nestled in. It was moving in a straight line in an easterly direction and within seconds had bisected the valley from East to West.  I called my friends attention to the strange cloud, as the sky was clear blue for as far as the eye could see in every direction from North to South. We looked on in amazement as 15 to 20 pink circles moved through the cloud from East to West. They moved relatively quickly, each at an even pace in no particular order or formation from the Western foothills to the Eastern Foothills.  Each circular light was about the size of a quarter if you held it at arms length to the sky.  I don't know if it was the shock of the experience or the OZ effect, but all other sound disappeared (from my recollection at least). My dog was no longer barking but sitting and staring with us at the sky.  As soon as the last circle passed over the eastern hills and out of sight the ""tail"" of the cloud followed and quickly moved across the valley and out of sight to the East.  This has one of two UFO sightings I have experienced in my life. The second can have a possible logical explanation, but without further evidence remains unidentified. This experience was wholly otherworldly.  It occurred in broad daylight. When I questioned other people that day and around the same time not a single person had seen a thing. If it weren't for my friend being with me I would not be able to believe this memory to be real.  Everytime I speak to this old friend I actually have to ask if he too remembers this occurance just to remind myself that I am not crazy.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,37.3388420218894,-121.88970568836406

I was in the passenger seat looking out my window, it was pitch dark out now. I believe we were on the north side of the lake when I noticed what I thought to be car headlights driving down a hill, until one light stopped while the other continued and my mindset went to a motorcycle or ATV. The light that continued stopped and then went back towards the other light as if it were in reverse. My mindset then ruled out a motorcycle and stayed with ATV or possibly a ski lift (I am not familiar with the area)Then I bugged out and asked my friend to stop the car because I wanted to see what these lights were. (He didn't stop and gave me a weird look) What the lights did blew my mind with wonder of what they could be. The only description to accurately describe what the lights did is, if you ever seen two squirrels chasing each other around a tree playing. When we got back to his house a five m! inutes later, I was mesmerized and filled with excitement for what ever I just witnessed. I had a cigarette outside on my friends deck with my eyes to the sky wondering what I seen, yet knowing exactly what I seen. I then took notice of a very bright or close star. That star went from big, to small, to tiny, and then to gone. Then returned, tiny, to small, to big, and then was gone. I stood there in awe, saying holy shi*. It was like a confirmation, an answer to my question, an end to my wondering. But even more so, a realization that ""they"" were aware of me and my wonder, and ""decided"" to let me know. I'm a retail manager, the 2 lights were white. I was up there helping a friend landscape his property. My friend spoke nothing of it, not one word.

After hearing about NUFORC via Leslie Kean’s book “UFOs”, I finally decided I should go ahead and submit what I saw. I was in my early 40’s at the time and was (still am) an I.T. consultant. My recollection of the event is still very good.  I do not remember the exact date nor even the year. I do know it was late summer of ’07 or ’08, possibly ’09. I know it was late summer because that is hurricane season and I went to the beach for a surf trip. So likely August or September. Definitely it was a Sat early morning, 1-1:30 AM as I drove down from Atlanta and this would have been a ~7 hour drive, and I left my house Fri eve.  I stayed at a friend’s house on Kon Tiki Cir. I will not give you the exact address in order to protect his privacy in case he still lives there (have lost touch with him).  He had a small “tool shed” (used as an office) in his back yard where I was to sleep. I arrived about 1AM, we exchanged a few pleasantries, he probably gave me a beer and he went to bed (no I did not get drunk). I stood in the yard next to the shed, drinking my beer, decompressing from a long drive and stretching my legs.  His back yard faces the ocean and if you look on google maps you will see that Kon Tiki Cir is  less than .5 miles from the ocean. There was a row of trees about 10-12 ft high at the property line of his back yard. I was standing probably 30-40 ft away and more or less facing them (therefore I was facing the ocean).  I do not remember if I happened to just look up or I saw something out of the corner of my eye but a few sips into my beer I saw five (could have been 7 but probably 5) green, glowing football shaped objects flying above the aforementioned trees. They were heading south.  Each football was exactly the same size, shape, and color, which was a dim green, basically the same color of green as you would see on LED’s on an appliance, such as a microwave oven.  Because each light was not bright at all, you could clearly make out the football shape. In other words the edges of each object were sharp and well defined.  There was one football in the middle, and the other 4 were arranged symmetrically and equidistant around it and from each other, let’s use a clock and say roughly @ 2, 4, 8, and 10.  I could not make out anything else, so I cannot say if these were lights attached to a larger object or they were individual “lights” flying in formation. There was no sound.  As far as the size, if you squashed the moon into a football, and maybe shrank it by 10-20%. Something like that. I also had the impression that this thing or things was pretty far out over the ocean. Maybe a mile or more.  The whole thing lasted maybe 7 seconds and then it appeared that the lights all turned simultaneously to the southeast and disappeared. Making me think that they were attached to a larger object.  The speed was kind of like a flock of birds flying by at close range. But again, I felt like this thing was pretty far away so it would have been traveling much faster. The lights never changed size, shape, brightness, color. The only change was the “directional” change that I just mentioned.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,,

Volley Ball Sized Light Orb passed through my glass window and into my apartment and I touched it and lost consciousness,Los Angeles,CA,2010-09-15T21:15:00,sphere,unknown,"Occurred : 9/15/2010 21:15  (Entered as : 09/15/10 21:15) Reported: 7/25/2021 1:20:15 AM 01:20 Posted: 8/16/2021 Location: Los Angeles, CA Shape: Sphere Duration:unknown",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/164/S164154.html,"Volley Ball Sized Light Orb passed through my glass window and into my apartment and I touched it and lost consciousness This event occurred in mid-September 2010. Unfortunately I found the experience so shocking I denied its occurrence even to myself (I decided it had to be a dream or hallucination) until about 2 months ago when I found the courage to search ""light orb flew through my window"" on Google and was SHOCKED to discover many accounts of encounters with seemingly sentient orbs of light--often referred to as ""ball lightning"". Then I found clips on youtube of people that had strikingly similar encounters--and I really got the chills hearing others echoing my own encounter (albeit I'm yet to really find anyone who got as close as I did to it). But hearing others recount stories so similar to this event that I had told myself didn't happen allowed me to accept that it likely really did happen. And reflection of how vividly I remember the so-called ""hallucination/dream"" also helped me to believe my own story. But due to this being something that occurred so long ago, that! I believe I was in denial of, some details aren't as vivid as others. I don't know the precise date or time of the event. Only that it was mid-September 2010 and after dark but early enough that I was awake in my home with the lights still on. I have some fuzzy memories of time that aren't as vivid as the memories of the experience itself that I feel apprehensive to commit 100% to in the way I can the actual events of my encounter.  With that out of the way, here's my detailed description of my encounter with a Volley Ball-sized orb of bright white light with a swirling cloud of light around it.  I was home alone in my 8th floor downtown Los Angeles loft--which looks out over Los Angeles Street, with very high ceilings and large glass windows that provide an expansive view from the edge of the high-rises. I was seated atop my bed, with the large windows to the right of me, watching a TV that was in front of and slightly to the left. Out of the corner of my right eye I saw something bright hovering slowly towards my apartment window. I recall not fixing my eyes on it bc for an instance I thought it was a trick of the light or some kind of optical illusion and if I refocused my eyes-it would be gone. But the object grew closer and I fixed my gaze on it (couldn't tell u if I paused what I was watching or muted it, or what it was--can't recall) and watched it come in kind of a low arc up and THROUGH my glass window.  At this point, what I believe is natural shock reaction was occurring. I was seeing something unlike anything I had ever seen--a light ball, as I described above, coming through my glass window (not shattering just passing through it) and slowly hovering into a corner between the window and a large pillar (it's an old building with pillar-like supports between 3 large windows) and slowly rising upwards. I remember experiencing feelings of shock, awe, confusion, terror--I remember a spiritual thought process kicking in, thinking maybe it was an ""Angel""--or maybe ""death""--you know like ""Go towards the light!"" I was thinking-""Maybe this is that light"". I was really scared. It slowly hovered towards the bed I was sitting atop--a large California kinf sized bed. It was closer to the end of the bed, not above me. I vividly remember slowly standing up to it, in a crouched position, king of rotating so I am standing atop the bed (remember this loft has like 18-20 ft ceilings) my bac! k basically now to the window it entered through, kind of crouched under it. I slowly reached towards it and as my hand got close to it (and honestly all of this--I could act it out for you, the standing the way it made me feel--this is the most vivid of all) I felt almost repelled by it--not physically, and nothing electrical, but it made me feel light headed and woozy. Like the closer I got to it I felt weakened and faint. I kind of hesitated a few times with my hand out like that and moved it forward into the light ball and lost consciousness. When I awoke I was indeed sideways atop my bed as if I had collapsed from the position I just recounted...but somehow I instantly told myself it was a dream/hallucination and never told anybody until my recent revelation.The ball of light was gone and left no trace. It was odorless, soundless-I don't recall the window having anything wrong or if I even checked it. I honestly instantly went into denial and didn't give it much thought. But the incident popped into my head occassionaly for years and left me wondering.I have no history of any kind of hallucinations before or after that event. I have some colorful dreams but nothing as vivid as this--this was a memory of a trauma IMO--not a dream or hallucination.  I don't know if touching this did any damage to me or what the light ball was or why it was in my home and how it is able to enter with impunity. It leaves many questions and concerns now that I accept what happens--but it feels like trying to solve a case way too late after it occurred. From November 2010 I had health problems that I thought were induced by some poor dietary choices (a raw vegan diet for an athletic 25 year old  really was too hard on me)but have had lifelong pains and physical issues ever since that have never been fully explained to me and I can't help but now question if touching whatever I touched could correlate in some way. I also reported this to MUFON this week and I just wish I could be provided some resources to tell me what to do after realizing this happened.  I have no idea what this or other light ball entities are. I can say it appeared to me to look very much like illustrations of atoms--in fact what lead me to look into this recently was my recent interest in quantum physics and seeing various illustrations of what an atom looks like--they look like and reminded me of the light ball I saw. It was as if the bright light in the middle is a nucleus with a whirling electron cloud of light around it.  I don't know if this is from the Earth, the sky, another planet, another dimension, another time. But I do know it happened.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

I sent an email to someone well known for his knowledge in unknown arial phenomena to get his opinion. He stated he did not know what it was that I saw. Regardless of his comment I eventually dismissed my sighting as space debris.  Now 10 years later I revisited my email and realized that my space debris explanation was not sufficient, mainly do to the speed of the object (which from the email apparently concerned me back then as well). For that reason I decided to file this report.  Most of it comes from the email I sent 10 years ago. I did however add to the report from current memory where the information was lacking from the email. Therefore most of the report was recorded the day after the sighting.  Here is my report.  I arrived home from work to my home in the suburbs of Nashville, TN last night at about 12:20 AM CST  Nov 8th, 2010. I decided to take my 20x80 astronomical binoculars out to look at Jupiter. I had seen a bright star which I mistaken for the planet. The star turned out to be Sirius.  Since I had the binoculars out I decided to look at the stars. I focused on a patch of stars directly over head at the zenith and suddenly something came into my field of view and very quickly exited. It traveled through the center of my view and not kidding it traveled from one side of my field of view to the other in 1/5th to 1/10th of a second. The timeframe stated is not arbitrary. I spent about 10 minutes recapping the event from memory trying to determine the amount of time it took to traverse my field of view. The object was headed directly southeast. It traveled so fast that I could hardly make out the form of the object. What I saw were three well defined white lights in an equilateral triangle headed point end first. There was absolutely no sound in the sky, no sound of a jet engine.  Using astronomy software called Stellarium I was able to estimate that the object was about 7 to 10 arcminutes in size however, this estimate was made from my current memory and not made 10 years ago.  My first thought after witnessing the object was that I had seen a satellite. It wasn’t until maybe 20 minutes later that it occurred to me that satellites don’t appear as triangles.  The next day (Nov 9th 2010) I went outside to compare what I saw to high flying airliners. I witnessed one airliner at about the same location and it traversed my field of view in 4 seconds. What I saw was traveling across the sky much faster.  Binoculars I used were Cabela’s 20x80, field of view is 2.7 degrees, 141 ft at 1000 yds.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,36.13170004240882,-86.7768134860051

We continued to talk, but we're looking about now across the street at the trees. The green light zipped on the power lines next to us again, causing us to turn around. One craft was spinning. It had green lights lining the center of the one craft, they were no more than 200ft from the ground, and 300ft from us. Both were clearly visible. The other was not moving, and it had no lights.

The travel speed I am unsure of since it is hard to tell the exact size but it was a steady slow rate. As we followed it southbound young rd since that’s the direction of where our work is it continued for about half a minute, when it reached Airport Rd it must have been roughly above the chilliwack municipal airport suddenly from its steady highway speed it darted south east bound I have to guess hundreds to maybe a thousand kilometers an hour towards the United states border roughly the direction of North Cascades National Park direction.  From its steady highway speed to roughly hundreds of kilometers an hour was instantaneous and silent not a sound. Triangle shape best I can describe is from what I could see had 3 points and lights near each point, hard to tell the exact color though it seemed medium to light grey in color. So from the way it traveled seems like it was going westbound on yale until it was directly above Young rd, maybe it circled the airport I am not sure though the speed sure seemed very fast as I’m sure any jet would have been very loud this triangle object was definitely silent as I did try to listen.

On my way to I-95N from Conway, South Carolina, my GPS kept rerouting and taking me down back roads that seemed to be all farmland (cornfields specifically). It would not allow me to adjust the route to return on the main roads I had taken to get there originally. There were very few homes or lights.  Since there were no street lights, it was very dark, which made it easy for me to notice the round soft blue light hovering eerily behind the treetops. My window was down, and I was travelling approximately 25mph at the time. There was no noise whatsoever, besides the sound of my vehicle, even as the light began to move out into sight. I asked my friend what she thought it was, but neither of us were sure.  Something about the silent movement, and the placement of only one light on the front (no blinking lights as would be expected on a plane or helicopter) made it difficult to take my attention away from it. The movement was very smooth and precise as it slowly came into full view, just above the trees to my left.  So low in fact, it appeared to be touching the treetop. It was chevron shaped with the little round blue light on the bottom front.  It appeared to be black in color, and very flat.  Portions of it seemed to be transparent since the blue light remained visible but slightly distorted as it glided slowly across our path.  It was about the size of two or three standard cars put together, and the chevron shape reminded me of the batman logo.  I slowed down, afraid to go under it, but before I came to a complete stop, the UFO stopped in midair, angled itself downward directly toward us, and after a brief pause started to descend.  There were no propellers or engines on it, but was clearly a ""controlled craft"". It was not at the mercy of any breeze or wind, although it seemed to glide. I panicked and floored it out of fear.  We both lost sight of it behind us.  I do not know if it landed, or flew off. There were n! o other visible witnesses, or anyone around at all. I have ove! r 20 yea rs of health information management experience as a district operations manager in several hospitals.  I'm an educated man, do not jump to conclusions.  I'm very analytical, and critical in my assessments.  I've never believed myself to have seen anything like this before, and do not take reporting this to you lightly. Afterwards, my friend and I realized we could not account for an hour of time in our travel, and our voices were hoarse.

It was as though no shadows existed. I saw light outside the windows but it didnt behave normally. It disregarded the covered porch and came from all angles. My mother saw the same light behave the same way in the windows behind me.  The light was there for about what seemed like 10-15 seconds and there was no sound. After it disappeared I asked my mother what the light was. She didn't know and was unsettled. I ran outside immediately. There were no airplanes or helecopters outside. It was a clear night. I checked the back and front yards seeing if I could find an explaination for the light like a popped fuse or flashlight or anything but had no explaination.

I am a practicing attorney in good standing in all jurisdictions where I am licensed. I am, admittedly, interested in the UAP phenomenon. Because of this, I recently purchased a gen 3 night-vision/thermal monocular w video recording capability. I live in the DC/metro area. I am familiar with the appearance of airplanes and helicopters in the sky. Despite light pollution, the monocular does permit me to get a decent view of stars, planets, and the moon. Given atmospheric effects, I am aware that stars can appear to twinkle, and even bounce, around in the sky at times. Again, I understand this perceived movement of stars is not actually occurring.  Since I have owned this night-vision device, I have recorded some interesting sights/sightings of objects in the late night/early morning sky that are not otherwise visible to the naked eye (please note that I am also not able to see any stars, satellites, or most planets without the night vision). Times of occurrences are btw 11pm-3am numerous weekday evenings. Usually, I witness intermittently (.5 of a second or faster apart/btw blinks) blinking objects which move horizontally across the sky at a moderate/swift (not particularly fast) pace. Sometimes they seem to completely disappear (and not reappear, like a star might). Other times, there have been two closely flying pairs of these lights similarly moving horizontally across they visible section of sky somewhat in tandem. There is no real rhyme or reason to when these lights will appear and/or disappear unlike the flow of airplane traffic to/from Dulles or BWI or National Airports. The objects do not have the blinking lights (green and red with white) that are characteristic of FAA type or military aircraft. I can't make out anything other than a blinking light - is the entire object the blinking light? Or is my camera not detecting the body of the craft? I don't know the answer. The distance appears to be a few miles out from my window at least (can't be sure). There is no discernable sound, but, again, I live in a noisey/congested area. I don’t get the impression that these are satellites. My understanding is that most? all? satellites do not blink or emit their own light source. I have tried to do some digging as to the movement of 'cell phone' reception satellites but I have not found much info. Maybe I am witnessing drones, but they do not appear to fly as I might imagine drones to fly. Also, the DC/metro airspace I live under is extremely restricted, so, at the least, they are not private individuals’ drones. In conclusion, I do save my recordings and am more than happy to meet and share these with whomever is interested. Thanks very much.",,39.07793837209302,-77.14956651162791

On Google Earth you will see a pond at the north end of the nuke site. That was then a stream with a waterfall.  Me and my two brothers had borrowed grandfathers small boat to go to the waterfall to catch turtles. Just before we returned, we were standing on the cliff to the south of the waterfall looking southwest. There were large cumulus clouds in that view, the sun to our back. My youngest brother Said “Look at the big white bird”. We all focused on the bright object that appeared to be moving slowly, as if flying toward us. It soon became obvious that it wasn’t a bird, but a cigar-shaped object that was stationary and slowly rocking in position. A few seconds later, the object moved with instant acceleration upward, through a huge cloud, popping out of the top, again stationary, renewing the rocking motion. It was only then that we grasped the size of the object. It was very large. A few seconds after that, with instant acceleration, it went up and to the south in a curving flight and disappeared. It was only then that we realized that we had been looking at the edge of a fat disc. Many years later, I ask if the three of us could write on a piece of paper what we saw that day. We did so, and the stories were very close to the same narrative. So, I know they are out there. It was clear daylight, no flashing lights at night, no little green men, just a flying machine that defies what we know of physics. It seems to me that the only way that craft could behave that way is if it had near zero mass. I have not seen anything like it since.",,,

It was probably summer in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  My two sisters and I shared an upstairs bedroom.  I looked out the open window, and turned my head and looked straight up.  I don’t know why, maybe looking for stars.  I saw 5 or 6 lighted disks arranged concentrically.  I don’t recall if the whole wheel of lights was circulating or not, but it stayed in the same position; directly overhead.  I could only see the sky when looking directly overhead because of the tall trees everywhere else. The light from the ‘things’ was diffuse not sharply defined.  I don’t remember being alarmed, rather I thought it was fun, fascinating. I probably wondered if this could be experimental balloons?  At least one of my sisters was in the room at the time.  I am checking with them to see what they remember today.  I do remember someone mentioned they might be angels.  I don’t remember staying at the window for very long, so I didn’t see them move on.  Later in life, after meeting my husband, I mentioned this to him, but don’t think I felt comfortable telling anyone else due to the stigma attached to that.  The memory of the event is strong;  always  5 or 6 orbs of light arranged in a circle, just hovering.  Not sharply defined lights, but too perfect to be clouds.  No way to tell how high up, but high enough that I was not alarmed in any way.  Went to bed and slept well and didn’t think much about ‘it’.  I am reading the May 10 New Yorker article “The UFO Papers” by Lewis-Kraus, and I thought I would search for a way to report my sighting.  I understand Congress will receive The Pentagon’s U.F.O. Papers this June.  This is the reason I thought to look for a way to report my ‘thing’.  I am a 66 year old female.  I graduated from The University of Tennessee with a degree in Plant and Soil Science.  I never launched a career in that field, except to work as a lab assistant in Stuttgart, Germany for a 4 month practicum.  I extended my work at the lab another 3 months after that, then toured Europe.  I worked for USAA for 10 years.  USAA is a highly respected auto and property insurer.

He became an electrical engineer and I stopped working to become an artist and homemaker.  My father worked for Union Carbide, which later became The Atomic Energy Commission, and now The Dept. of Energy, at the Gasous Diffusion administration facility on the Oak Ridge Reservation.  He was the internal auditor for the project.  During the Cold War, he built a bomb shelter in our basement, as Oak Ridge was considered to be a target of attack by the Russians.

At the time, I was a Captain and a highly qualified Navigator (5,000+ hours flying time) with the US Air Force, and was flying a C-124 Globemaster aircraft from Bucholz Army Airfield located on Kwajalein Island, Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands to Hickam Air Force Base at Honolulu, Hawaii.  I flew the route periodically and had never encountered any other aircraft traffic on that route.  As far as I knew, only the Military Airlift Command wing at Hickam Wing and their C-124s were the only aircraft the ever flew in this part of the world – and the purpose of our missions was to ferry supplies and a few passengers between Hawaii, Johnston Island, Kwajalein, & Eniwetok.  Circumstances at time of sighting: Location:	16N – 176W (approximate) Date:		August 16, 1968 (approximate) Time:		Approx. 0800 GMT (Local time – 2100) Altitude:	9,000 feet Airspeed:	200 Knots Heading:	Approx. 060 degrees, true Weather:	Clear – Unlimited visibility – Dark – Moon:		Waxing Gibbous – overhead, slightly behind aircraft Lights:		None on Ocean Surface – only nav lights on aircraft – using red light in cockpit  I was between required fixes, and was sitting in the co-pilot seat in the cockpit (co-pilot was in the bunk).  Cockpit instrument lights were configured red for night flying. I spotted a light green glow on the ocean in front of us (relative heading 30 degrees).  Due to lack of fixed objects outside the aircraft, would estimate the spot was 3-4 miles in front of us.  I pointed the object out to the Aircraft Commander (Maj. Hal Walthal) and between us we speculated what it might be.  It looked like the glow was under the ocean surface and appeared several 100 feet in diameter, although there was no way to know for sure, as there were no outside references and we were at 9,000 feet. We speculated we might be looking at “maybe” a missile equipped submarine with a door open and that was what was emitting the light.  We talked about the French testing nuclear weapons in French Polynesia, but knew that was about 5,000 miles south of us.  We recheck NOTAMs and there was nothing mentioned there. As we came closer (perhaps the spot was 1 mile away at our 2:30 position, the light began rising vertically.  We picked up nothing on our weather radar (APS-42), and the green light continued to rise vertically  - perhaps at 10,000 ft/min rate of climb until it was “far” above us (perhaps 30,000-40,000 feet) at which time the object literally performed an immediate, sharp. 90-degree turn to seeming level flight and headed in an Easterly direction.  It was still glowing green and its lateral acceleration was unbelievable – perhaps 1,000’s of miles an hour, and almost immediately disappeared into the distance.  We knew the laws of physics would not permit any known vehicle to physically turn 90-degrees like that, nor accelerate to that speed that quickly. As the UFO disappeared to the East, we discussed whether it might be a threat to the United States, even though the US coast was 3,000-4,000 miles away.  We pulled our instructions for filing a CIRVIS (Communications Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings) report, but as we composed the report, we speculated that whatever the UFO was, if its intent was to do damage to the US, it would likely be there and carry out its intended damage long before anyone received our report.  By now, we had the whole crew involved discussing our sighting.  Several of us “knew of” people who had formally reported UFOs in the past, and knew they had spent years answering bizarre questions and being hounded by “investigators”.  We speculated that formally reporting our sighting might wind up being a career-impacting event, and most of us were career-minded people. So … we ultimately chose not to file the CIRVIS report and let the event “slide by”.  For the next several hours we tuned our HF radios to stations where we thought we might hear news if something or someone attacked the US.

I’d always been aware of a vague memory of us seeing a ufo in the front yard that night. I half dismissed it as a dream. Decades later, I saw something on TV and felt the memory rush back very real, and I asked my mother that night over the phone if it really happened. She said it was real and remembered it quite well. We both remember it as circular, and it hovered above us silently with green and white or yellow lights. She said it was up in the sky and later just went away. I believe at some point the lights appeared in more colors and slowly blinked in an entrancing way.  I think I remember them pointing at it and speculating what it could be. My mother said we never found out what it was. I also have a vague memory of running back to them from the side yard as they w! ere calling for me. I can’t remember whether I saw it first, then wandered off or vice versa. I have another strange memory of later hearing my mother say to my Dad, “How does a child just disappear?

My friends' house is right on the lake, with a large deck overlooking it. This was probably our tenth dinner invitation at their home. Another couple was there as well. Dinner was on the deck as usual. After sundown, the sky was fabulous. Fifty miles away from the lights of NYC there's very little light pollution so it's a great place to watch the cosmos. This night was clear without a cloud in the sky.  One of my friends' guests and I talked about the amazing sky over the lake and about constellations. I told him I didn't know much about them but I had a Sky app on my iPad. I gave him my iPad and went back to the discussion on 1950s be-bop or something.  About ten minutes later he asked me what that constellation was. He pointed over the horizon across the lake. I spotted it, took the iPad and pointed it at the three bright stars he indicated and didn't find it either. I said it was just three stars so it might not be a constellation at all. Maybe that's why it didn't make the app.  ""But they're moving!"" I looked again and, sure enough, they were, albeit very slowly. They were moving due west and they were moving independent of each other. They had a roughly triangular formation, with a “lead” object but they seemed to be moving at different and varying speeds relative to one another. They were bright, solid white, showed no navigation beacons and made no sound. I couldn't tell how high they were but a passenger jet heading due north, probably flying a polar route to Asia, flew into view and I could tell by its size that it was flying at at least 30,000 feet. It flew under these lights.  At this point, dinner party conversation ceased as all six pairs of eyes were glued to what we were witnessing. All I heard were murmured comments like “Are they... drones?” and “Do you hear anything?”  It was evident by now, even to our hosts who had lived for 40 years on that lake and seen hundreds of meteor shows, that this wasn’t a normal celestial event. The lights were stopping and starting which means they could hover and no rotary wing aircraft flies that high. So they definitely weren't helicopters and they weren't drones. Maybe they were weather balloons and the light was actually the sun over the horizon reflecting off their mylar skins?  But these balloons were moving due west, which is contrary to the jet stream. I also knew from my recently-deceased older brother who was president of an amateur ballooning club in Colorado that they no longer used mylar for balloons. Mylar used to be used to bounce radar signals off a balloon to track its position but modern balloons carry their own telemetry now. My brother used to build them.  So they weren't aircraft and they weren't balloons. Someone said ""ball lightning?"" I didn’t know but I did look it up later. Ball lightning is plasma and usually associated with the highly charged air around thunderstorms and the sky was clear with no storms forecast. I saw ball lightning when I was a kid but I'd never heard of ball lighting being this high or lasting this long. We had been watching this for over five minutes.  Suddenly my girlfriend exclaimed, ""Look at that!"" She pointed to the horizon across the lake where we'd first seen these lights but this one light was very low to the ground. Everybody gasped because it was so much closer and it glowed bright red, like a Roman candle. It definitely wasn’t a conventional aircraft. She said she saw it come up from behind a low mountain about two miles away. I saw it hovering over the mountain.  Then it shot straight up, stopped for about 15 seconds around 2500 feet AGL and hovered again. Then it slowly moved north about what I estimated at that distance might be a half mile. It hovered again. I looked back at the three lights and saw that they had suddenly turned due north. The red object shot up at extremely high speed and in the direction of the three lights. By “high speed” I mean that it disappeared into the noise of the star canopy in less than two seconds. When I looked back at the three-light formation it had also disappeared.  I’m not a believer in space alien visitations. I’m not even a believer in secret government technology as advanced as what I saw. I’m still not. I'm not saying what I, rather we, saw. I have no idea what it was. I just know what it wasn't, which was anything familiar to me and I'm an aircraft junkie. I think the rapid movements of the last object I saw would have killed a human occupant.  No, there were no pharmaceuticals at the party and drinking was light and social because most of us were driving home on those dark, deer-infested back roads. We’ve since spoken with each other about this event only a couple of times but I know my hosts are uncomfortable with the subject, as if they were subjected to a mass psychosis event and don’t want to be regarded as public kooks.  I told my brother what I'd seen. He used to be a Navy fighter jock (A4s) during the Vietnam War. He told me about a mysterious three-light formation he'd seen over the Spratly Islands in the early 1970s when he was stationed at Cubi Point in the Philippines. What he described was almost identical to what we saw. What was remarkable was that he never told me about it until I brought it up, as if he too was embarrassed by it. He never filed the sighting in an official report either but told me that lots of pilots had seen stuff like this on night flights. You didn’t report it unless you wanted to be grounded.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,41.2101,-74.295

It appeared below the clouds and appeared to be quite large, though he reportedly had no visual reference with which to compare it. It appeared suddenly, made no sound, made no movements, and disappeared just as suddenly after about 5 seconds. For being so anomalous, his reaction to seeing the object was one of brief puzzlement.  He felt no fear or shock and simply returned to his chore.  He thought about it as he worked and considered it a hallucination of some sort.  However, he had never hallucinated before and the object had such a quality of being ""present"" that he found it ! hard to categorize it as a hallucination and said nothing of it to anyone and simply thought about it for some time before deciding to make the report.

In 2013, my friend and her boyfriend were driving us back to her house (in Hagerstown, MD at that time). I was looking out the window from the back seat when I saw a deep green light in the distance over the woods, in the sky, that moved slowly, horizontally, before pausing and dropping directly behind the trees.  In 2014, my friend and I were walking our coworker to her car outside of our restaurant job in Germantown (at that time). As we were talking to her before she ducked into her car, I noticed, again, a deep green light in the distance, in the direction of Father Hurley Blvd. It moved horizontally before pausing and dropping vertically. Later that Summer, we were driving on the back roads at night (in Boyds), when we saw large lights scattered within close proximity of each other in the sky. What freaked us out were the helicopters (3) and the plane-like drone that were flying towards them.  In 2016, I was walking home from a friends house mid-afternoon. I happened to glance up when I saw what looked like a large bundle of black balloons. What stood out to me was that they didn't appear to be moving, and I also couldn't make out if that's what it actually was (I can't see too well from afar). Shortly after, it broke up into several black pieces and sort of floated in the general direction I was walking in. I had taken my phone out and snapped a few photos right before it began to move, in which it had startled me. In me rushing home, my eyes kept on it when it eventually moved back together and kind of steadily and smoothly glided away.  To add to 2016; there was a night when these two figures in my neighborhood displayed very bizarre behavior that still has yet to sit well with me. I was on my porch some time after midnight when I heard shoes dragging against gravel from the end of my neighborhood. These two figures turned the corner at the end of the neighborhood and began to slowly walk in my general direction. They stopped at one point before one of them started to walk backwards at an angle, never turning to see what was behind him/her. The other person was walking towards a white van when they appeared to see me before taking a single step behind the van. I went inside at that point because of the sketchy behavior. We had a large, bay window in the living room/front of the house, so I peered behind the curtain. After a moment, I watched one of them make their way down my sidewalk, up my yard, to the window. They just stood there, never moved to look in or around, they just stood in front of me. I didn'! t make out a face as everything was dark within their hood. I eventually ran to get my brother and called the police. The next day, my uncle who lived up the block from us, his truck had been broken into and all of the papers within it tossed. Nothing was taken. That probably has nothing to do with the sightings, however directly after this happened, I started having dreams about things being on fire and tanks/planes falling from the sky. The dreams have not stopped yet, and are almost always consistent on a daily basis. I read that someone else who claimed to have seen UFO's had two men in hooded attire knock on his door late at night who frightened him. He claimed to have seen weird things in his head and had consistent dreams of wars. That's what made me want to bring this to light.  The last time I saw a UFO was in September of 2017 in Cancun, Mexico. It was at a resort and it seemed to be very far. It was pale looking and I think tic-tac like. I watched it move quickly back and forth but didn't know if I was actually seeing it. My brother's husband along with his brother claimed to then see it, which made me believe it was real. They are two of the biggest skeptics I know, so it solidified that for me.  I hope this sheds some light on your research, and I appreciate the work you all do in learning and expanding on the general knowledge of life as a whole.",2021-05-20T00:00:00,39.15498641618497,-77.27253757225434

They had perfectly normal-looking humanoid bodies but what happened was not normal.  I was walking up a rather steep hill to my home after school.  I saw a tall man (about 6'2"").  He looked to weigh about 200 pounds.  He was well-built.  Bald.  He was dressed like a chauffer --  in a black, closely-fitting coat, black pants and some kind of black boot/shoes.  He was standing on the street in front of a parked car; the hood was up and he was looking inside at the engine.  I was curious, so I stopped to watch.  ""What are you doing?"" I asked.  ""None of your business,"" he replied rather antagonistically.  ""Go on your way.""  I got the idea he was German.  He had a very slight accent.  But his remark, being unfriendly, irritated me, and since this was my neighborhood, I didn't want to leave right away.  I wanted to watch.  So, I stayed, watching him and noticed that he wasn't making any progress with whatever was the matter of the car.  After about 3 or 4 minutes, I turned my head and noticed there was a man sitting in the back seat, somewhat next to the window.  This car had 'suicide' doors.  I am not very familiar with the various makes of cars, but this looked like it might be a Mercedes Benz, not the kind of car one would usually see in my neighborhood in those days.  Just as I was getting ready to go on my way after all, the man in the back seat started to move - to get out of the car.  The back door to the car had been open the whole time but I hadn't been paying it any attention.  This man was wearing a brown suit, brown shirt, brown tie and a brown bowler hat.  He was quite fat, maybe 5'8"" tall, at least 250 pounds or more.  (He reminded me of the ""Wimpy's"" hamburger character.)  I was standing about three feet away from the car doors when he opened up the door to the back seat.  I could see that this man in the back seat of the car was having trouble getting himself off the seat and onto the sidewalk.  And here is where it gets TOTALLY WEIRD:  instead of stepping out and standing up, he seemed to have no strength in his legs, so his body started to fall -- to collapse into the space between the side of the car and the sidewalk.  But the way he fell was unbelievable.  Slowly.  Very, very slowly.  It took him so long, it seemed as though he wasn't being affected by gravity.  He fell so slowly I actually glanced at my watch and then went back to watching him collapse and he was still falling.  It took him several minutes, at least, to fall down.  (As far as I knew, that kind of slow motion happens in Hollywood movies, but not in real life.)  I asked this man if he wanted some help, although I was much smaller than him and didn't know if I could do any good.  He shook his head in reply.  That's when the man standing by the car engine told me, ""He doesn't need any help.""  That's when I got suddenly nervous about who these two men were and decided it was time for me to get going - fast.  However, for some reason, I said, ""I'm going to tell my mother about you,"" and he said, ""No one will ever believe you.""  And that's when I realized that for this final remark, he used mental telepathy because his mouth definitely wasn't moving.  I immediately left and continued walking up the hill to home.  When I got home, I told my mother what I had seen, and she, being a practical person, definitely did not believe me.  She told me not to be ridiculous, that I had misunderstood what I had seen.  For years after that I actually had trouble being believed when I had some kind of trouble.  The 'spell' was broken when I had an upset with my middle brother.  I was telling the mediator of this situation what was going on and he didn't believe me and suddenly my brother said: 'my sister is not a liar.  I believe her'.  I immediately thought back to that man telling me 'no one will believe you' and realized I had been carrying his 'curse', shall we say, for several decades.  I recognized a sense of relief and release immediately.  * * * * *  When I filled out the report form, I said the spacecraft was rectangular.  I had to fill in something, but it wasn't a spacecraft of any kind.  It was an automobile.",,42.33433885350318,-71.12733885350319

We also had some marijuana. We kept getting chased away from the usual places so we ended up in an area of sand dunes that is between The city and the beaches. Not far from Craig Field. He was trying to get the car unstuck from the sand going back and forth when I looked up from the front windshield and saw a round hovering craft with colored lights blinking around the outer edge.  I called my companion’s attention to it. He saw it too. We both stared at it for a moment and then it took off very low over the dunes. It made no noise and did not stir up any sand. We got out of the car and tried to run in the direction it went. That was not easy and we soon got winded. We decided to go to a high area to see if we could see ! anything. We did but there was nothing in sight. We sat down to catch our breath and smoke a joint. We were probably about a mile from the car and could sat looking back in that direction. Shortly two other vehicles entered the du es from the road we used to enter. We initially saw only the headlights. They had to be 4 wheel drive to travel on the dunes. We kept watching and they kept coming towards us. Until we became alarmed. They were clearly aiming for us and traveling pretty fast. They both came up the dune where we were sitting and I ran. I think he did too. I was blinded by the lights. They may have used spot lights. I ran down the dune into a wet area and fell down getting icky water and stuff all over. The cars which looked like black Jeep’s kept going in the direction that the craft went without stopping. My companion was not pleased with my wet swampy self getting in his car and he drove me home in silence. I did not see him again for a number of months. It was w! arm the day. I immediately started reminiscing about what happ! ened. He said he did not remember anything that happened that night. He remembered picking me up but nothing else. The pot was.

I saw an object moving west at a relatively slow pace at an approximate altitude of 1500 ft. It seemed to be rotating and the sun was reflecting off of it.

I'm a professional pilot with 15 years experience and It was definitely not an airplane or helicopter.  Oddly enough as I decided to document the sighting a police helicopter showed up in the exact same area and flew around for some time at a higher than normal altitude.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,26.600205714285714,-80.12513920634922
