Together these objects moved synchronized in a triangle formation maybe 60 feet from each other and slowly. These lights were traveling south toward my parents’ home when I had seen them, maybe 1000 yards away. There was a lot of cloud cover. These objects were traveling silently below the clouds and perhaps only 150 yards in the air. My mother curiously went outside to closer examine what we were witnessing.

There were exactly eight of them, and they were in two groups of 3 each, and then there were 2 more trailing behind.   They were traveling pretty much due north, and I spotted them when they were due west of me.  Unfortunately, they were actually at their CPA when I first saw them, and so the best part of the sighting was right at the beginning. The sky beyond them was a pale yellow, and consisted of a smokey overcast back-illuminated by the sun, which was fairly low in the sky.  (We've been having huge brush fires out west in the glades, and so for the last three days or so, the sky has been a brownish overcast most of the time, and you can smell smoke most of the day...)    The objects themselves were between 1 and 2 miles away.  (It's hard to estimate the distance because they were just silhouetted against the sky, and there were no buildings or mountains or anything to use as a gauge.)    Similarly, the altitude was between 2000 and 5000 feet by my best guess.  If they were 1 mile away, then they were at about 2000 feet.  If they were more like 2 miles away, then the altitude was probably about 5000 feet.  (If they were any farther than that, then they were HUGE.  But by the way they were moving so deftly around each other, I got the impression that they were only about 30-40 feet in diameter.)    Their color was indeterminate, and as they were silhouetted against the yellow sky, they appeared black or dark gray. Their speed was MUCH faster than any aircraft would be normally traveling at that altitude.  Of course, if they were high and far enough away for 500 mph to be a ""normal speed"", then their size would have been in the neighbourhood of several hundred feet across.  There was also no sound whatsoever.  And if by some chance they were propelled by air-breathing engines, then there would have definitely been a substantial sound made by eight aircraft at that approximate distance, moving at that approximate speed.  As it was though, there was no sound whatsoever.  They moved completely silently, and with a sort-of ""slippery"" type of motion. They were not travelling in perfectly straight lines.  But instead, they were zig-zagging slightly, which was causing their relative positions in their loose formations to change substantially as they moved across the sky.  Each of the groups of three remained ""intact"", although the relative positions of the various crafts within each group seemed to change, almost as though they were ""trading places"" with each other within the formation. The total length of time of the sighting was about 20 seconds. There were dark, ominous clouds to the north, and about halfway through the sighting, the background changed from pale yellow to a bluish-gray color, and they became harder to see at that point.  They were not only getting farther away with each passing second, but there was much less contrast between them and the background sky once they left the pale yellow area. I am a former airline pilot with approximately 12,000 hours, and I've flown equipment ranging from Cessnas to Boeing 727's.  I have 20/10 distant vision, and I am absolutely certain that the objects I witnessed were not helicopters, balloons, blimps, birds, floating debris carried by the wind, or any type of fixed-wing aircraft.",2011-05-29T00:00:00,,

All of us couldn't believe what we were seeing.  Everyone was asking, ""Are you seeing what I'm seeing?!""  I kept saying, ""Oh my God, Oh my God""  I'm so mad we didn't pull over and take pictures.  Although I'm not sure how well the pictures would've turned out because we didn't have actual cameras, just our phones. Of course lots of people don't believe us and are assuming that it was a blimp or a helicopter.  All of us saw the exact same thing.  There's no doubt in our minds that it was an ET UFO.  None of us have ever seen an aircraft like that before.

Nothing was displayed on our TCAS (traffic, collision and avoidance system).  We question air traffic control (Boston ATC) if he had any other opposite direction traffic.  There were none, however he said there was a primary radar target at our six o’clock position and 8 miles. We filed an official report through the air traffic controller, and he said another aircraft reported the same sighting. I have doubts it was another aircraft or UAV because of the extremely high rate of speed that it went by us, so fast it was impossible to even identify the shape.

It was the fastest thing I had ever seen in the sky, I usually look up at the night sky and see airplanes and observe their speed, size, distance and other statistics so I can distinctly know what I'm seeing.

One object appearing like an orange and yellowish round fireball, or meteor-like, started rapidly falling from upper left portion of window (about 10 o’clock on a watch dial) towards the lower right of the window (or about 4 o’clock).  After dropping to about 20 degrees off of the horizon to the lower right of my window, the object very quickly changed direction and shot off slightly to the right and away and disappeared over the horizon in kind of a bow shaped pattern following the contour of the earth at about 20 to 30 degrees.

It initially appeared about the size of a golf ball from my vantage point, but was very small when it shot off and away to the right.  Total viewing time was a matter of a few seconds.

This object moved as fast as a baseball thrown, and no noise was evident, as a plane or helicopter would, and was unlike anything I’ve seen. A striking characteristic was how it moved in the sky.  It moved in a very deliberate manner, slightly jaunty, as if surging and exploratory, not with a real sense of direction.

There is usually a logical explanation for things that happen but I can't find one for what happened this night!    The object (fireball) was traveling south southwest. We were about a 1/4 mile west of Lake Erie and about the same distance east of South Rockwood Village Limit!  My mom and I were on our way home from the gas station, about 10:00 at night.  I was listening to my iPod with my headphones.  It was a clear night.  We were almost home when I felt my mom tap me. I pulled my headphones out n turned to her!  She was saying ""look!  Look up there!"" as she was pointing in the sky towards the lake.  I just kinda casually looked.  The trees were kinda in the way at first, but it really caught my attention as it came into clear view. I'd never seen anything like that! I thought it was a plane on fire and asked my mom if it was!  She said it looked like it.  She was driving real slow.  She pointed out that she didn't see any wing tip! lights or plane in motion lights!  I didn't see any either!  We just figured the fire affected it's electrical system!  When we drove around the river bend she pulled over n stopped.  She said she was gonna call the Sheriffs.  We were watching this thing.  It looked like an airplane as far as its air speed and distance.  It crossed over the road ahead of us.  Its speed hadn't changed at all since it cleared the tree line and it wasn't flying any lower!  It just looked like a moving fireball in the sky.  Not quite round when it was moving.  No sparks or trails behind it!  It looked like it was over some farm fields when it just suddenly stopped!  It didn't slow down at all, it just stopped!  After it stopped it appeared to be more round!  It didn't fall or move in any other direction.  Its color n brightness didn't change at all.  It stayed in that position for a long time, maybe 30-60 seconds!  Then it just slowly fadded out till there was nothing!  Like a slow fizzle!  I didn't see anythi! ng come crashing down to the ground.  Even though it was dark  I was looking!  There were no falling sparks, nothing!  I've seen probably hundreds of 'falling stars', my mom always points to the sky!  This was different! I also never heard any sounds. The next night about the same time we pulled into my grandpa's driveway, about a block away from where we stopped the night before.  My mom and I both seen a plane, but it was different than any I've seen.  All the lights were red, wing tips and plane in motion!  It was moving fast and flew out towards the lake n was gone.

In winter of 2010, my daughter and I were on our way home from the gas station.  We were driving east on a river road.  I always look to the skies, day n night. I play the name the plane game with her at times.  This night I spotted what appeared to be a fireball in the sky.  It was traveling south southwest. I quickly pointed it out to my daughter as it was clearing the tree lines and entering open visability! Before it cleared the tree lines it seemed to stop for about 15 seconds.  I assumed it had changed flight direction and just appeared to be standing still.  I was also traveling on a slightly twisty road but was on a straight shot at this point.  It did not change shape or size.  Then it started back into it's original path. It was moving at a speed common to planes that fly over.  When it reached clear sky, she asked if it was a plane on fire, which was my first thought.  I did not know who to contact in reguards to this. After I cleared the riverbend in the r! oad, I pulled over!  The vehicle behind me passed and was driving extremely slow! I was getting my phone to call the Sheriffs dept.  To report a possible plane on fire. I did not call!  My daughter n I watched this object fly over the road and seemed to suddenly stop in mid air as it was hovering.  It made no navigational moves what so ever. In the first seconds it stopped I was expecting it to fall to earth!  It did not!  It appeared to be over farm land and very close to us.  It stayed in that spot for at least 45 seconds, blazing bright as it was when I first spotted it! Then it slowly started to fizzle out over about 15-20 seconds.  Then it was gone!  Once it was gone, I thought I seen some dark spots, maybe smoke which seemed to disapate!   I was looking to see if I could see an object falling, I did not!  It was dark out, but a clear night.  When the object was traveling, it was roundish in shape but had the appearance of something on fire traveling.  When it was stationary, it kep! t the more round appearance! It did not change shapes (triangl! e, squar e etc...) nor were there any other objects around it.  I heard no sound coming from it but also had my vehicle running with the windows up. It is very common around here to see small objects falling to earth in the night sky.  Those objects keep the same path and fizzle out as they fall, continually moving!  They are also much smaller and different in color.  They are nothing like this fireball I just described. I'm a logical person but can not place a logical explanation to this event.  The following night, I pulled into my dads driveway (which is a block away from where I pulled over)!  A plane in the night sky caught my attention.  It was traveling north then seemed to change course quickly to a northeast patern and appeared to go out over the lake.  It was traveling very fast at a low altitude! All of the lights on it were red, not caracteristic of our normal air traffic! My first and only impression of this craft was millatary!  My vehicle was running with the windows up,  I did not hear any sound.  My daughter also witnessed this.  I've never seen that type of craft around here before nor have I since.

I was on the Colorado University Campus and lay down on a bench while on the phone with my friend and was just looking up at the sky when an airplane flew by and left a streak in the sky.  I landed my eye on that streak so I would have a point of reference and saw these 2 lights that were definitely above the airplane streak move. They both moved in a semi straight line, past the streak and then stopped.   I then spotted a third one moving toward the airplane streak, but it did not pass it. Those 3 lights lined up in a straight line.    After spotting those, I tried to look for others, and thought I saw things moving, but the streak had faded, so I didn't know if my eyes were playing tricks on me. But I know that I saw those 3 lights move, and they were too far away to be a plane.  After a while, the lights very quickly moved upward and disappeared to my sight.

The orb wasn't attached to anything. I was watching television Sat nite 4-16-11 when I heard a very low flying jet getting closer.   went out in my back yard and looked up just as a jet, at only a few thousand feet, had passed my house traveling in a northerly direction.  ( Mesa Gateway airport,   formerly Williams Air Force Base, is about 10 miles from here to the northwest ) Flying along with the jet was a red orb.   My first thoughts were that this was the Anatov 225 (biggest plane in the world) sneaking into the airport to refuel without attracting attention with the red lite being on the craft that generally flys with it. I realized almost immediately that this could not be the case since the plane wasn’t nearly big enough to be the an 225 and the red orb was not attached to anything.  As I watched these continue north, the orb moved to the left of the jet, then  seemed to backtrack toward me.  I say “seemed to” because for a moment it appeared much larger than  when I first saw it as if it was! closer to me.  Thinking about this last night (4-18) it almost seemed, in retrospect, that the orb was aware of my presence and was checking me out.  It then  retreated back closer to the jet after this and after a few miles the jet banked to the west with the orb disappearing in a westerly direction over the rooftops.  The only sound heard was the relatively quiet jet engines and nothing else.  The only lights on the plane were a dim white light at the tip of each wing.( I couldn’t really see the plane due to the darkness but had the wings been visible the lites would’ve have been on the tips)  No landing lites, no strobes, just the dim lites above,  If you put my address in Google Earth you’ll see that my house is at the back of the development.  The plane and orb were traveling just inside the back edge of the development toward the north at a very low altitude.  Others in the neighborhood heard the plane also and were very surprised at the low altitude, though I was the only one to go outside and look.  It almost seemed that both objects were trying to get to where they were going while attracting as little attention as possible.  I’ve never seen a plane flying that low over these  houses, let alone at midnight on a Saturday!  I have no doubt that something out of the ordinary was going on.  The orb reminded me of one that I saw 2 nights running (Aug 8 & 9 in  2009 except that was very high up in the sky.  That orb was reported on this site, as well as Mufon and ATS.",2011-05-02T00:00:00,,

On the evening of  the 17th of April, 2011 at approximately 5:40pm I observed 3 small points of light in the sky just underneath very dark clouds.  At this time we were driving west bound on SW 88th St (Kendall Drive) and the objects were high in the sky.  Since we were driving home I lost sight of them.  About 2 minutes later we arrived in front of our home, I ran out of the car to see if I would see the objects and found a spot  near the lake for a clear, unobstructed view.  It took me a few moments before I saw 3 star like objects in the sky headed in a north westerly direction.  They looked to be twinkling or flickering on and off and also seemed small and orb like.  As I stood there more and more began to appear. The weather conditions were very cloudy with dark to light grey clouds in the sky, but as you looked west it seemed to be clearing up and plenty of sun light was coming from the west.  I believe that the sky was clearing just over and around Shark Valley Everglades National Park.  I believe this is important because I realize now that this was most likely the cause of the objects appearing to twinkle or flicker.  They seamed to be metallic and able to reflect or shine light from this source.  In addition, I would like to mention, that it was not raining. The direction I was facing on the lake was north. At first all I saw were objects to the north that seem to just disappear  into the clouds once they hit the northerly point, but then I started to look further to the east and noticed that the objects would begin appearing exactly 90 degress from the north ( towards the east) and I was not able to track them coming in from further south. I also realized that the new local hospital was having its grand opening and started to think it might be metallic balloons from the hospitals grand opening.  Only problem was that these objects were traveling fast and appearing high in the sky in the east as a small twinkle and then, although small, as they traveled north east they would look slightly larger in size having enough mass I could more easily follow the objects.  Just to make it clear I was facing north and my arms spread to a 90 degree angle (left arm directly north, right arm east). I had to question myself about the possibility they were balloons and check myself, but I have seen runaway balloons and they were not.  The movement was steady and fast and they all seemed to travel along just right underneath the clouds. These objects seemed to be coming from a distance near the turnpike (5.4 linear miles)  on Kendall Drive from my home and traveling north east towards the casino. I also noticed airplanes on their normal flight path over the everglades near the casino area heading towards Miami International Airport for landing. In comparison these objects, I believe, were much smaller making them appear farther. From the moment they appeared on the east to the moment they disappeared in the north it only took the objects 30 to 40 sec from point to point. Some of them looked to be traveling a bit faster than others at times. In total I saw approximately 20. Please also note I could not hear sounds from these objects like you would fighter planes. Near by is Homestead Air Force Base, but had these planes flown by you can easily see it’s a plane. I checked the wind direction on-line at:   http://www.usairnet.com/cgi-bin/Winds/Aloft.cgi?location=MIA&hour=06&course=azimuth   The winds at that moment and using a 6 hour forecast were all pointing east, from 3000 feet, and south east in higher elevations.  Had these been balloons they would be traveling against the wind. I hope this has been helpful.  My 15 yr old son was with me and witnessed seeing some of these objects as well.  I am a 34 year old female that works in the admitting dept at a hospital neat Miami International Airport.  I've had an interest in shows involving UFO's, but had never, till yesterday, seen what I believe were UFO's.",2011-05-02T00:00:00,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829

We have photos and Details, the object was no doubt a UFO. I was walking my girlfriend home after an AMAZING DAY.  It was around 9 or 10:00 at night when we were in this deserted street, I looked up and saw this object, it was a bit fuzzy because it looked like the moon behind some clouds.  Thing is, there was no clouds in the sky, so after a while of staring at it i point at it for my girlfriend could see.  She immediately said it was a UFO, but i was questioning it.  First, i saw a Blue light (which i thought was the clouds) illiminating all around it.  It had the classic UFO shape, you know, sort of like an oblate spheroid.   This is what i saw:  It had a classic UFO shape A bright blue light illuminating it a smaller red lighting under the center and it was actually relively close for us to judge that it was not a plane.  There were many planes flying around us because there's an airport near by.  But living in New York you can tell what's a plane and what's not.  This definetly wasn't. I started naming things it CAN be. I thought it was a hellicopter. Because of the bright light. But what canceled it out is   1.  If a search helicopter was out, the lights wouldn't have been around it, and the chopper would've been smaller; 2.  If it was a larger chopper, it could possibly be that shape at a distance, but not from this distance; 3.  The object was moving VERY slow, almost still, and kept at the same altitude  We watched and walked for 10 minutes or so and it was actually following us, very slowly.  There was this point where we were walking but keeping an eye where a building go in the way, we speed walked passed it and in that time (about 5 seconds) it was already in front of us.  It amazing us because it was going soo slow, but randomly zooms passed us.   We kept watching and i noticed the red light, it would blink not too often.  Also if it were a plane,  1.  It'll blink repeatedly;  2.  It would definitely not be as bright as that.  We watched more, till it got smaller, like it was moving away, we watched till it fell behind some tree's and it was gone, we then saw it about 5 minutes later for a few seconds then lost it again. What's really got me is the bright blue light around it.  It truthfully looked like a force field or energy wall.  It was truly amazing, i really never believed in aliens but this is getting me to question it. P.S my girlfriend had taken pictures, it's very legit",2011-06-20T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

The sightings occurred in the backyard of my parents house approximately around midnight on 06/01/11 and on 06/02/11 in sequence with each other.   Allow me to state that these dates may be incorrect by a day or two, being that I cannot be absolutely sure they are correct, but I am certain it was in the first week of June. Periodically when I’m at my parents’ house I would like to go outside and enjoy a smoke and play fetch with my eight year old chocolate lab Brandy.  My parents’ back yard isn’t a large one, and is concealed by a wooden fence, with a fire-pit in one corner and a dog house in the other.  The property itself resides in the small village of Bergen, located west of the city of Rochester, N.Y., in Genesee County. Around approximately midnight of the first sighting, I had finished my cigarette and begun to walk back to the house, when I suddenly got this urge to look up at the night sky.  At first glance there was nothing out of the ordinary, but after staring up at the stars for about less than a minute an arrow head (or triangle) shaped aircraft silently flew over head.  On each one of the three points was a dim ball of light, and may I add that these lights gave off no reflection or glare what so ever, but instead had the tone of what a reddish orange blanket would look like if you were to put it over a light bulb.  As the aircraft flew behind the cover of some trees, I tried to run to maintain vision on the aircraft, but it was gone by the time I made it around the edge of the trees. My first reaction to this sighting was disbelief, and that maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me.  It felt almost as if I was stuck in some dream for about five minutes and woke up after it was all done.  So the next following night I decided to go out again, and once again I saw the aircraft. The second sighting took place around midnight as well, and when I saw it again for the second time, I knew it wasn’t my mind playing tricks on me.  It was different in certain aspects though.  This aircraft seemed to be flying on its’ side, but still maintained the triangle shape.  In between each of the lights seemed to be this very thin string of light between each of the three lights, and the lights themselves were rotating around each other. I have gone out every night since those sightings, and haven’t seen those types of aircraft since.  Now in both directions of my house, and I mean East and West are the Rochester Airport and the Buffalo Airport.  So being 24 years old now, I have some general knowledge of what planes look like and sound like, and I can honestly say that I have never seen anything like that before.  It hasn’t been too long since those sightings occurred and for some reason I have a very strong gut feeling that they won’t be the last.

It was very hard to tell how high up it was but as it approached it stayed straight on course never swaying in either direction and very smooth.

We annually take 2 weeks vacation the first of June in an ocean-front house in the 'historic district' of Pawley's Island, SC. On the night of June 8th, 2011, at approximately 9:30 pm, I was sitting on the front porch facing the ocean, talking with my 82 year old father-in-law.  He was not facing the ocean.   Suddenly, above the horizon, 4 large, orange glowing fireballs appeared simultaneously, and in a perfect horizontal alignment.  I do not startle easily, but the intensity and peculiarity of the apparently unnatural lights alarmed me.  I instantly wondered if they were some new type of warning flare, which were signalling a ship in distress.  However, I instantly dispelled that possibility because these were clearly pulsating lights, and not any type incendiary device whatsoever. My brother-in-law is a seasoned International Flight Captain with a major airline, and has extensive military combat flight training and experience before that.  As such, he has witnessed an inordinate share of ineplicable ""object"" or ""light"" events in the sky over the last 30 odd years, but none have ever raised his surprised reaction and disbelief as did his mutual witness of the intense lights we both saw. These lights lasted approximately 30 sec and then suddenly and simultaneously 'zipped' below thw horizon.  There had been neither any discernible ascending trail of vapor or accelerant when they first appeared, and as I happened to be looking over my father in law's head directly at the point in the sky where they appeared, they simply ""turned on"" as though someone had thrown a switch.  Likewise, when they descended, they did not ""fade and fall,"" but rather descended like the lights on a drag strip timed starter. Incidentally, my father in law has advanced arthritis in his spine and neck, and even though I implored him repeatedl to turn and look at the lights, he unfortunately could not shift in his chair enough in 30 seconds or so to turn completely around to witness them too, before they descended.  Also, although I had my iPhone 4 with video and camera with me, I was so startled, I didn't even think to try and capture the images in any format, which I now regret in light of their duration.  I guess that ""YouTube"" reaction is substantially more prevalent in much younger generations than mine. Regardless, knowing the distance to the horizon at near dead sea level is approximately 11.3 miles, and calculating that we were sitting on a porch roughly 15 feet above sea level, I later roughly calculated the lights appeared perhaps 10 or so miles from the shore (although I could discern no visible reflection at all anywhere in the water as they glowed), and using the same calculation relative to their apparent size, I estimated they were spaced in the sky perhaps as much as a mile or more apart from one another, in a perfectly symmetrical, horizontal formation on an exact level with the horizon of the ocean. Still not ruling out the possibility these highly unusual lights were still only some form of new distress warning lights or flares, we watched the local and marine news reports carefully the next few days to see if any ship-in-distress call had been logged where flares or warning lights were deployed, but we never found any such reports or news blurbs. Later that same night, although they had not witnessed the original lights we men had, 2 'night owl' women in the house were still up and talking on the beachside porch about midnight, and next morning reported that the lights appeared again in the night sky, although approximately 10 miles east from where we had pointed earlier to show them where they were when we first saw them.  On the coastal map, they would then have been closer to Litchfield Beach, Surfside Beach, or Myrtle Beach.  Incidentally, they also said they heard what they believed were probably military aircraft moving at a high rate of speed in the general direction of where they saw the lights appear, and described their impression that the aircraft were seeming to be ""racing for"" or ""chasing"" the lights.

Bright lghts apppeared at our 12 o'clock and moved to our 9 o'clock position slowly. ((NUFORC Note:  Pilot report.

January 11, 2011   To whom it concerns:   At approximately 6:45 pm, Tuesday evening, while enroute to KBUF from KHVN, half way between ULW VOR and BENEE intersection at flight level 200 the captain called to my attention a bright light directly in front of our aircraft.  The Captain remarked that it might be a planet considering that it was so bright.   As I made visual contact I remarked that the flickering/flashing light seemed to be a consistent flash and was getting closer hinting to the fact that it was not a planet.   As our flight continued in the next few minutes the light did indeed get closer.  Our aircraft was flying west bound at approximately 380 knots true airspeed and the flashing lights were heading east bound at a fairly slow speed, slow enough that we were able to view the lights for approximately 5 minutes.  I found this to be peculiar considering that in my 5 years of professional flying typically aircraft passing at this altitude pass each other very quickly because they are operating at their cruise air speeds.  The relative motion of the flashing lights just did not make sense, just to slow.   It was at this time that the captain called New York center and inquired with them about traffic at our 9 o’clock position and above our flight level. New York center informed us that there was traffic at that position however it was west bound, same direction, as our flight path.  The lights that we were observing however were east bound and moving at significantly slower speed than a jet or turbo prop aircraft typically does.  In fact, I remarked, ""Is that a helicopter?""   The observed lights did not make any evasive maneuvers nor did we need to maneuver to avoid a perceived collision.  The captain continued a dialogue with ATC as they inquired with other aircraft in the area if they had observed what we had reported, the other flight crews however did not see anything. The lights observed consisted of a large bright white strobe like light at the lowest point as well as three to four smaller white lights that surrounded the main light.  The brilliance of the light lacked the whiteness of modern strobe instead it had a pearlescent quality and flickered rather than flashed however with intensity.  At times then main light seemed to be casting a fluttering shadow much like a flashlight would yield if cast through a rotating fan blade.  In fact that prompted me to question if the craft was a helicopter as previously stated. I looked intently for the red and green navigation lights that all aircraft have conversely none were observed. The flight conditions were good; visibility was excellent as the stars made a magnificent backdrop as they typically do on night flights during the winter months.  An overcast layer existed well below our flight level that I estimate to be at 10 to 12 thousand feet.  The flight did experience intermittent light turbulence, as we got closer to KBUF most likely because of the approaching low-pressure system.  Weather conditions deteriorated in the decent to KBUF, which required an instrument approach for landing on runway 5. In summary, what I had witnessed was completely unique and somewhat confusing.  Hopefully I was able to convey my experience with some coherency.  If I can provide any other help or you need further explanation please do not hesitate to contact me. Sincerely.

The first of four UFO sightings I have experienced happened in 2004.  I am not sure on any specific dates though I am sure about the month and that it was late July of my first sighting.  I was with two friends at the time. We were juniors in high school, thus for a long time I did not feel I was credible enough to come forth with the sightings, however, as I am now a college graduate, mind has not changed that what I saw were UFOs. The first two sightings both consisted of nothing more than orbs of light in the sky, to far and too small to distinguish much more than it was a ball.  I did not think these relevant for a long time until I recently saw a computer simulation made by UFO specialists to try to recreate something someone had seen.  It looked a lot like what we had seen. Lexington is a small resort town in Michigan.  There are lots of beaches, but we only night swim in the harbor as it is really sandy.  We face the east so see the sun and moon rise. On that particular night I was with two friends, all three of us were carelessly watching the sky for at least an hour or so, as it was an extremely bright night.  The beach is maybe a quarter of a mile from the road, with no nearby lights, so we were used to it being abnormally dark.  On that night, it was extremely bright, the moon was full and there were tons of stars shining.  The sky wasn’t even black, not even velvety, but a moonlit blue. It was because of the clear visibility that I believe there was more in the sky than what we specifically focused on.  The orbs looked very much like stars. When we first noticed one it seemed to be traveling towards the moon.  We’re not far from some airports and military bases, so we know what normal lights look like.  These were not normal.  They were just about the size of the stars, maybe just slightly bigger, and instead of having a golden hue on the edge like a star, they were white lights with blue hues on their edges. As we watched one travel towards the moon from the east, one of my friends spotted another coming from the northwest.  The one from the east was traveling much faster, and in a direction we could not attribute to any known flight path.  At that point we were still willing to dismiss the sighting as nothing more than planes but they were too high. The most intriguing part came when the orb from the east reached the moon. Instead of flying under it, as we expected the light to do, it began circling it, and not in a two-demential manner, but a three-demential one, where the orb actually disappeared behind the moon for a few minutes and returned to the side we could see only to go back around again. As the orb from the northwest came right up to the moon it too began circling it too, but in the opposite direction.  As that was happening several more orbs of light started heading towards the moon.  As one of my friends began to panic, I was out numbered on the vote to remain and though I kept my eyes on it the entire time by the time we got to the car the offending orbs never came back around from the other side of the moon, all the orbs had stopped moving and the sky looked still again. That was about it for that one. It lasted maybe ten minutes or so.  We were young, B+ and A students and though even writing it sounds strange I know what I saw.  When I later told another close friend about it, she too had seen the strange lights from her home in Croswell, Michigan, six miles away.  For the rest of the week we observed glimpses of these lights and more and more people came into the school talking about them.  The talk lasted a while, but everyone dismissed it as skeptical parents insisted we saw military jets.   I am sure that is not what it was.  My father, who’s twin brother is a pilot, agreed that this sighting along with my other three are legitimately unexplained. I have no photos of any of my sightings but will be sending a package of some maps and a few sketches with this story via mail.

This was my third UFO sighting. It took place in August 2006. I figured this would be my last or at least my best sighting. I was arriving home from a late class; it was probably around 9:30 to 9:45pm. Everything had gone normally on my 40 mile drive from the community college back to my small town. I had the windows down because it was a warm summer night. To the west of us are several lagoons and a creek, to the east our fields are low and damp most of the summer, thus frogs are loud, very loud all the way up until the first frost. As soon as I turned on to the three-quarter miles of dirt road to my house I was welcomed by the familiar sound of the frogs.  I listened to them, turning off my music before I rolled up my windows and got out.  As soon as I was stepping out of my car onto the driveway, all of the frogs, on either side of our house went entirely silent. It was terribly frightening, as I had lived here all my life and had occasionally heard the frogs in our field stop croaking with the obvious intrusion of a predator. The same went for the occasional silence from the creek behind by neighbors to the west of us. But, I had NEVER heard the frogs from the lagoon stop croaking, not to mention all three locations at once, or even two of them at once.  I don’t really know what made me do it, but trying to locate to source of the suddenly palpable tension from all the life in the woods, (did I mention EVERYTHING stopped making noise, no crickets, no owls, no loons, nothing), I looked up.  Out of my four, maybe five, sightings, I have never been so scared. It was so low. Likely only 200 feet or so from the ground, as it was only 100 feet or so above our 90 foot trees. It scared me so badly I froze, as it was over me when I looked up, but not hovering, rather moving very slowly from the west towards the east. It was so close I could very clearly see its shape. I don’t really know what to call the shape without drawing it. It was very rounded at the font and came to three points at the back. I was directly beneath it so could not see its cabin, but there was a single two-part bright white light in its center and absolutely no landing gear, not even a seam.  I don’t know how to explain what I called the “two-part” light. They were square lights, and right next to each other, vertically on the craft, but the one nearer the front of the craft was brighter.  It was not pointing its light at me or at anything really. It was just moving, very, very slowly towards the east. It’s speed was so incredibly slow and it was so low that I actually began panicking after I realized not only had it caused all of the animals to silence, IT made NO NOISE, absolutely nothing, not a hum, not a buzz, not even rustling the leaves in the trees.  As soon as my fear of being abducted passed and it was nearing the edge of the forest I ran straight for the house without looking back. I told my parents directly and was shaking with panic. I still want to say “It was INSANE!” I have no idea what it was. Last year or two years ago, when the military finally admitted to having a Black Manta, I thought that was what it would be. But I’ve seen a Manta, and read of it. It says it’s 60 feet wide and 30 feet long. What I saw was not a triangle, but a half a circle (sort of), with three points on the back. It was likely only 20 feet wide, maybe 20 to 25 feet long.  It was most notably, silent, seamless, and slow moving, and strange that the light didn’t seem overly bright since it was so close.

I was with a friend in the garden of my front yard of my house in Croswell, Michigan. It was late and we were enjoying the summer night when we saw an orb in the sky heading east.  It was darker night, and there were a few stars, but not many. My property is also obscured by many locust trees. The orb was very high. It left no trail and was intensely bright white with no other hues on the edges. It was a single orb, slightly larger than the stars and moving fairly slowly, though not obnoxiously slowly; so that when we first saw it we dismissed it as a plane.  It was not a plane, as it was too high and suddenly changed speeds. It went from a turtle crawl to traveling very quickly, within the distance of my driveway, which is short and circular. Then, as it came over us, since the garden is on the north east side of the house, it made an extremely abrupt 90 degree turn to the south. Immediately we were jumping up and down with excitement as I screamed: “It’s a UFO!” We then began chasing it, as the trees obstructed our view when it made the turn. As we ran into the backyard, towards the south, it made another extremely sharp 90 degree turn to the east, disappearing over the woods.

There are three total witnesses.  The events I will cover happened in the same exact location on Chippewa County public land over Firth Lake Latitude: 45.2024648 Longitude: -91.2134803.  The first craft was observed as Witness A was peering out of the camper window because they noticed lights outside.  Witness A and Witness B went outside to check it out and Witness C stayed in the camper and pulled the blankets over their head.  The object looked like about 20 lanterns hovering directly over Firth Lake approximately 15-20 feet above the lake.  Witness B picked up a flash light and was going to shine it at the craft, Witness A yelled at Witness B not to do that.  There were many bright white lights, however, you could tell it was only 1 craft and it was circular in shape and huge.  The craft just sat there for about 5 minutes and then in an instant shot directly up into the sky and was out of sight.  The second sighting was during bow hunting season approximately a year later.  Approximately 3pm witness D was in a tree stand and could see Firth Lake.  Out of no where comes 1 very bright white orb.  It was observed going around Firth Lake in a circular motion at a fast speed as well as moving up and down over the lake and then vanished into the woods.  Witness D was at first was amazed and then suddenly overcome with fear.  Witness D hasn't been back since  Background Witness A - Army/Airforce/Truck Driver 74 years old Witness B - Army/Plant Manager 45 years old Witness C - Nursing Home Activity Director 72 years old Witness D - Metal Injection Molding Operations 25 years old  I am not sure if this is a government agency I am reporting to or just some MUFON type of business.  I would really like to know what in the hell is going on there, I have heard there have been other sightings.  I haven't been back there to deer hunt since because I am just creeped the hell out by it.  People say it's just the Military, but why would they fly over Firth Lake?  There is nothing there for the Military...it's county hunting land.  I think some tests need to be done in that water there is something about that tiny lake that is attracting these things.  I would be willing to point anyone to the exact location where the crafts come to.  I used to enjoy hunting there with my family.  Ever since this I have not been back, I tried, but I get this erie feeling that someone or something is watching me and I always have to watch my back there.  I know it can't be military, why would they fly in like that in some wierd craft during hunting season?  What kind of Military personnel would fly around in a white orb doing circles around some random tiny lake?  I could see MAYBE flying in that large circle craft, however, that thing literally shot up into space so fast there is no way a human would survive....at least to my knowledge of G's.  What would happen if someone shot at one of these with a high caliber deer rifle? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We again witnessed our ""friends"" on the farm road on 10/25/10 at about the same time of night.  There was a car behind us when we stopped at my daughter's mailbox and it passed us and drove towards our ufo which was, once again, sitting in the middle of the farm road we were to take.  All the ufo did was move over into the field, as it did on our first encounter, to let the car make a left turn into a driveway of a farm there.  Then when the car came back out, the ufo didn't make a move to appear to just be another car. After the car left, we approched the ufo to the same cinerio.  It when up and proceeded down the road ahead of us.  When it got to my daughter's rental home, it went behind the same trees, as it has done, and just hovered there; no sound. I called my husband, whom has been dying to see the ufo to come right away.  He was about 20 minutes away and when he got there, it was still there, yet he said he saw two lights in the middle of the hayfield near the mailboxes.  My daughter and I had seen two other lights to the left of the road out in the woods, I forgot to point out, as well.  The two lights over the house appeared to be wider apart, so we are thinking this to be the ""mother"".  Anyway, we watched the thing for about a half an hour and took pictures with our cell phones.  None were as impressive as what we were seeing with our eyes. When we drove away, we kept stopping to see if it was following us and didn't see it anymore until we got to the mailboxes; then there it was in the middle of the hayfield.  We got out of the car and took more cell phone pics.  Then we went back down to the house and it again went on ahead of us stopping over the house again, no noise.  When we left the last time headed for home, if followed us all the way back to the mailboxes and stopped in the middle of the road.  It has never stopped more than 20 feet close to us. The following night when I took my daughter home after work at about the same time, there it was again,  Same thing, went ahead of us, than followed me back out.  I just rolled down the window and said ""See ya again, gotta go home"". We have not seen our ufo again since that night, 10/26/10.  We hope our friends will come back to see us again sometime.

I was walking Southbound on the Iron Horse Trail in San Ramon, CA around 5pm on January 25, 2011, when I noticed three low-flying bright white objects traveling from East to West across the sky. It appeared as if they were traveling West from the general direction of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  The objects moved at a slow-to-fast pace, often at a drift much slower than airplane/helicopter traffic that is regularly seen in this area.  The shape of the light was elliptical in nature, but it was so bright that it was difficult to see the object edges.  For that reason, it is difficult to make a solid judgement regarding the final shape of the object.  I will say that they appeared to be more oblong/disc-shaped, but at some points they appeared more circular and symmetrical as they moved across the sky. The sun had already dropped from view, so the objects really stood out across the colored sky.  I stood and watched for 15 minutes as they headed across a flight path that appeared to parallel the path of the 580 freeway going from East to West towards the Oakland/San Francisco area. There were three objects total. Regarding the flight path and group formation of the objects, I am going to describe this in terms of a grid, from my standpoint on the trail at the time of the sighting.  I work in the technology field, so I'm going to describe it as if I was looking at grid on a horizontal/vertical x/y axis. Think of this as if you were looking at the latitude and longitude lines on a map.  That should help with envisioning the explanation, as this is a difficult thing for me to describe otherwise. With that in mind, it appeared that each of the objects was flying on a fixed path, parallel with the ground.  Each of the three objects was at a different elevation, but it appeared that each of them stayed on a solid path that appeared to run parallel with the natural curve of the Earth's surface.  To the naked eye, and given the short distance in which the objects traveled and eventually disappeared in, it appeared as if the objects didn't adjust vertical elevation at all at any point during the sighting. While they each stayed on a consistent and steady horizontal flight path, the group formation and speed of the objects appeared more inconsistent. At first, all three objects flew in a tight equilateral triangular formation.  As the objects moved across the sky, they would independently change speed, eventually flying in a formation that more represented an isosceles triangle, then a scalene triangle, and then eventually back to an isosceles triangle formation.  Each object appeared to be at a different elevation, with the elevation differences between each object appearing to be equal to the naked eye.  The speed varied during the sighting, with each accelerating and decelerating independently at speeds slower than typical air traffic. There are 3 major airports (SFO, OAK and San Jose Airport) and many smaller airports (Livermore, Buchanan, Napa) and Travis AFB within a 65 mile radius of the sighting, so we regularly see all forms of air traffic.  These objects flew at varying rates of slow speed that aren't typical of any of the regular air traffic.  In addition, these objects had no FAA colored lights that are typically seen on regular air traffic. The reason I decided to post this nearly six months after the original date of the sighting was that I had stumbled across similar sightings online, and I decided that it would be helpful to document the sighting since it was so similar to others I had seen in California.  I also was able to capture an image on my cell phone of 2 of the 3 objects.  Unfortunately, the 3rd object was hidden behind a large power line pole, so it's not visible in the photograph. My background is in technology and design, and in my career I've also done a lot of work in photography and video.  What stood out to me here was the brightness of the objects, and how I was unable to distinguish the hard lines that would typically be seen around an object.  At sunset/dusk, any object in the sky is going to be backlit by the sun descending down the horizon line.  This means that the edges of that backlit object should be clearly visible.  The brightness of the objects, combined with the fact that there weren't visible edges, leads me to believe that these objects were radiating a large amount of light on their own. At the end of my roughly 15 minute observation, the objects disappeared from the sky.  It was as sudden as someone flipping a light switch.  There was no fading, or change in color or brightness of the objects. These could be government aircraft from a project at the Lawrence Livermore Labs, but they might not be either.  I guess that's why I posted the sighting here, because over the last six months there hasn't been a day that has gone by where I haven't looked up at the sky on a clear day in hope of seeing this again.  I am a skeptic at heart, but I know what I saw that day was unlike anything I'd seen before.",2011-06-12T00:00:00,37.78036335227272,-121.98620795454545

When I stepped outside I noticed 7 to 8 large round lights directly to the east, about a mile away, which would place them over the ocean.   I yelled for my husband to come and as he heard the urgency in my voice, he came to see what the commotion was all about, within 20 seconds.  He saw all seven lights with me and then we both saw them proceed to turn off, one-by-one.   He told me to grab the camera just inside the door, I was so mesmerized with the lights I didn't want to look away, they were very large, all of the same size and of a yellow/white light, no form was visible besides the lights.   They were at random in the sky, no special order or formation but pretty close to one another.  They were about 60 degrees above the horizon, totally still, not hovering, not making a sound.   They then proceeded to turn off, one at a time but with perfect synchrony.  I grabbed the camera as the next to last light turned off and started to film but the last light turned off.

Inside the triangles were undulating white, green and red lights that morphed around inside the triangles like colored bubbles inside a lava lamp.  Each triangle was about the size of a dime at arm’s length. Initially the triangles passed from the south toward the north in a somewhat horizontal path and stopped due east about 45 degrees above the horizon.  At the same time I saw an airplane pass in front of the triangles and then I saw a satellite pass over them. They were bigger than the jet airliner so they must have been at least 100 feet on a side. The objects were distinctly different from either the airliner or the satellite. The objects were about as high as the plane and beyond it a ways.  Once the triangles stopped, they slowly moved around in the sky, up, down and sideways with no particular pattern to their movements.  At times they hovered nearly still in their positions and then they would resume their dance.  The objects were never touching and did not remain adjacent to one another.   Eventually they started moving directly upward.  The triangle on the right stayed in position lower than the one on the left. As I watched the objects ascend, a deer entered my yard and startled me.

evening of august 13, 2010, i was outside observing the sky for the perseid  meteor shower.  i watched as the moon, venus, mars and saturn set in the west.  i observed satellites, commercial and private aircraft, as well as a few meteors.  at the time of this sighting, jupiter was just below the tree line in the east. i have been studying astronomy and the night sky for 20 years.   i know the difference between many of the things people think are ufos, and an actuall unexplainable object in the sky. what i saw friday the 13th, at about 10:25 pm was not explainable. i saw the whole incident through binoculars, with a momentary naked eye glance to verify. the object was in three segments or parts, but they all moved as if they were attached to each other.  they were a smokey grey/silver.  the edges were undefined.  each segment was shaped like an human eye--a tapered oval.  it was not lit but seemed to be either softly reflecting light or softly glowing from the center of each segment.  the center of each segment was lighter or brighter than the darker, undefined outer edges. when i first saw it, the parts were traveling abreast in a westerly direction, and then they manuvered to single file one after the other. they did not turn in any other direction, they just went smoothly from traveling abreast to traveling single file.  the largest segment was closest to me, and stayed in front.  the smallest segment was the center one. the last and farthest segment was sized almost as large as the first.  while changing formation, it did not change traveling direction.  it flew from northeast close to east of where the north star is, and went west just over the handle of the big dipper, on towards arcturus, where i lost it behind some trees.  after losing sight of it, i looked at the time, it was 10:26 pm. comparison--if you have ever seen the andromeda galaxy on a dark clear night--in binoculars, this is what each segment looked like--except darker undefined edges and of course it was moving.  each segment was roughtly the same size as the andromeda galaxy.    the formation took up the space that the plaeides constellation takes up in a binocular view.  although my binoculars are not high quality, they afford me a nice view of the night sky, i can make out the beehive cluster with them, but not something like the rings of saturn or the moons of jupiter.  the binoculars are 12x50, probably better for birding, but they do the job on a nice clear night. the weather was very clear, no clouds, about 72 degree f.  the sky was dark enough in my backyard to see the andromeda galaxy this night (i saw it later that evening). the stars were so clear that it was easy to see anything moving against the starfield, which is why i saw this object. i was facing due north, i has been following 2 satellites which paths had seemed to come quite close together in the northeast.  after they separated, the one i ended up following had faded in the north. this was when i picked up this object moving swiftly through the sky.  it was about 35 degrees off my zenith, traveling west.  it took maybe 10-15 seconds at the most (?) for it to be gone from my view. with north as 12 oclock, it traveled from 1 oclock towards my left (west) past 12, 11, 10 oclock, to about 9 oclock.   it appeared to be in space with the satellites, not close to where conventional aircraft fly.  the speed of travel was much faster than an airliner at 20,000 feet at 5 miles away, faster than any satellite  i have seen cross the sky, but slower than a shooting star crossing my field of view. as i watched, it went behind some treetops momentarily--and i still had no trouble following it.  there was no trail of smoke or exhaust.  all three segments seemed to shimmer or vibrate gently.  the shimmering was more perceptable at the edges of each segment. i have seen geese fly in the moonlight, and this was almost the same, but there were no wings flapping, no honking, no bird shape (no long neck, nothing moving on any segment) and the objects maintained a constant distance from one another like they were firmly attached even when changing formation. there was no attaching structure that i could see, i do not remember seeing stars 'through' or 'between' the segments, althogh if i had, i would have noticed. at this point the crescent moon had set, i suspect that this object was high enough to gather ambient light enough from the same source as our satellites (the sun), and reflect it back. it could have been picking up the glow of the moon below the horizon, or ambient city light glow.   the sight of it also gave me the impression that somehow it was absorbing most of the light, like it was cloaked.  my only other thought on what this was like would be an airplane flying with no lights at all.  it still does not explain the shape of the object, or the apparent formation change during flight. there was no sound, no smell, no vibrations, no strange feelings during this sighting.  i live approximately 6 minutes by commercial air travel from newark airport (25 miles or so by car) and wonder if anything showed on radar (if this thing was low enough).   becouse i am an experienced sky observer, i believe that this is indeed a ufo, unless there are man made crafts that can appear as i have described.  when i first saw this object, i remembered to be as observant as possible and kept in mind real life comparisons for a good description. i have searched the internet for descriptions or videos that are similar.  when i find something i will be in touch.  i am only sorry i did not have my hd camcorder ready, although i am not sure this would have shown up in video without more hi-tech equipment.  i get annoyed at some of the ufo reports that lack in detail, or have poor descriptions. and i want to be as detailed as possible. to demonstrated my observational skills and knowlege: previously, i have seen many things that seemed unexplainable in the night sky.  i came to no conclusions until i thought through what i had seen.  there was a reasonble explanation, no matter how fantastic it seemed at the time.   two of these previous sightings are as follows:  one object i had seen was a very bright round falling object in the southeastern sky in mid october. a peice of it had also fallen away below it like molten silver, i watched it fade after about 5 minutes. it made no noise although it looked like it would hiss like a fire if you could hear it.   it was either a shooting star coming directly at me that broke up into two peices, or a rocket booster falling away after lauch. this occured around 3 am and i was too tired to look it up, but i am sure that is what it was. the other object was a very distant, large bright green flair in a cold winter northeastern sky, a green so brilliant, like the the color green a diamond reflects in the sunlight.  this flair left a trail and it traveled in horizontal fashion, taking much longer than fireworks to fade. there was no sound. this was probably a military flare from a marine vessel (i live close to the waters west of new york city and staten island--close enough to observe a flare from the water there if it was shot high enough). the exact dates of these occurences have long been forgotten, because i knew they were easily explained.  at the time, they were surprising and amazing to see. i am an expereinced amateur sky watcher.  i would like to point out that i know the difference between the most obscure explanaions for identifiable objects, and an unidentified flying object.  i have seen almost every kind of non-ufo expample in the day and night sky -- so i do know the difference.  i hope there is some logical explanation for this.  i have never seen anything like this before. ok for preliminary email contact by nuforc investigator.   thanks.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,40.5411,-74.3632

My next thought was well it is just a satellite or maybe the space station, just then it stopped, It stayed stationary for about 5-6 seconds and then it started moving again but in a different direction, it now was heading toward the lake it made a large ark out and around the lake and right back to the place where I first spotted it.

About 5-6 minutes later my friend pointed out a really bright light in the western sky just above the tree line, we watched this bright light for a good half an hour, during this time we watched this light change from red to green to blue and also white. This light also would appear to just blink out completely for 3-4 seconds and then appear again but several feet in the sky to its left and our right, it also looked like it was moving up and down left and right and even at times in small circles this light disappeared 5 times 4 of the 5 it would re-appear but each time it came back it was a little more to its left, the 5th time it went out it did not come back. We had no clue what we were looking at and jokingly I said to my friend what would you do if it disappeared and all of a sudden it was right above us, as I finished saying that I kind of jumped and said holly shit that just scared the shit out of me, my friend quickly looked in my direction and said what?, and I replied oh that plane coming across the lake with its landing lights on, we kind of laughed but kept watching the plane, as it got closer it started looking more and more not like a plane,  My friend asked is there an airport close by and I said no why?  And he said then why would it be so low and have its landing lights on?  Well this got us both really watching these 2 lights that I thought at first was a plane with its landing lights on, it was getting closer and we still didn`t hear any noise. As it got closer we could see it better it had 2 large flood lights in the front but we didn`t see the standard red and green blinking lights on the wings, and still didn`t hear any sound from it we were sitting in the car with the sunroof open, and the craft was coming right at us from my left across the lake. It flew just about right over us, as it got right above us it was about 3-400 feet up and it flew through a small cloud as it got right above us that was when we heard a very low like rumbling sound nothing like a plane at all, but when it entered the cloud those huge spot lights in the front lit up the whole cloud and it illuminated the whole craft in like a golden aura, that was when the 2 of us really got a good look at it and I can say it scared the hell out of us both!! It looked like a large triangle, the first thing my friend said was holy shit look at that it looks like a pyramid flying over us!! It had the 2 large lights in the front and one large strobe in t! he back there were no other standard lights at all on this thing! what I saw was what looked like a pyramid sitting on top of this black triangle I also saw well the only way I can describe it as a half of an arch going from half way from the rear point of the triangle from the front arching up to this pyramid shape that was on top of the triangle. On the inside of this arch looking part on the pyramid part it looked like either a row of six windows that were illuminated from inside with a golden light or maybe it was just a row of 6 golden lights. It wasn`t moving very fast at all, maybe like 40-50 MPH because we got a good look, as it went over us for I would say maybe 4-5 seconds. On the right side of the road, is a row of pine trees as it went over these trees, I jumped out of the car and ran to the other side of the road just past the row of trees is a swampy area roughly a quarter of a mile across then you hit the rest of the woods. It looked to us like it had dropped even lower when it passed the first row of trees to where I thought it was either going to land or crash into this swampy area, but when I got to the tree line I could see this thing start to move back up and over the wooded area on the other side of the swamp, and it  seemed to just blink out of sight. I have never seen anything like this in my life, and I have seen a lot of different aircraft, I am a Navy vet that served during the Gulf war. I have been trying to draw what I saw but I am not a very good artist, after we got back in the car I realized my new cell phone had a camera and does take video I am really kicking myself in the butt for not thinking of using the phone to either video it or at least get a few snap shots of this thing!",2010-08-24T00:00:00,43.431099999999994,-70.9772

When I was in the US Army, I was assigned to the 1st Squadron, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment S-2 and along with other soldiers in the various S shops worked the Tactical Operations Center (TOC), with rotating shifts working one of three shifts: morning shift (0600 to 1400), evening shift (1400 to 2200), and night shift (2200 to 0600). One night (I think it was in August ’95), while working my rotation on night shift, as people often do, I had to use the bathroom which consisted of a porta-potty a minutes’ walk from the TOC.  Now, as I was in there doing my business, I was looking out of a small  window in the top of the plastic wall of the porta-potty, which was missing the plastic mesh that was supposed to keep bugs out, I notice odd lights in the sky.  The lights consisted of four diamond shaped lights parallel to the horizon, two on the top and two on the bottom.  The two on the bottom were spaced farther apart than the two on top, they didn’t change, although the colors seemed to, and which is I think what caught my attention initially.  I wondered what the hell these lights were as I finished my business and looked at them as I made my way back to the TOC to resume my station at the S2 section of the TOC. Later that night, of course, I had another trip to the latrine, and still the lights were there.  All that night I noticed them, with one of the times I was watching them with another soldier as I told him of them, I suddenly thought to lay down to eliminate me moving inadvertently as I stood there watching them, and I noticed a few other things.  They were not stationary in the sky; they seemed to me to move very quickly around what seemed to me in the sky a specific point.  And the other thing I noticed after the soldier I was with saw it for himself; he found another one on the horizon.  After I looked at it, I returned my gaze to the one I had been looking at all night, and I noticed another one to my left on the horizon. I thought of it then as the one I first saw being 0 degrees, with the one my fellow soldier saw being 90 degrees to the right, and the second one I saw opposite the one he found being 270 degrees.  For shits and giggles I assumed there must be one at 180 degrees and sure enough it was there.  They all had the same four lights in the same configuration, with colors changing that if you were looking at them for a time you would notice, but not if you just glimpsed at them.  And they all moved jerkily in the sky like the first one did around a fixed point in the sky.  I watched it a few moments, then got up and went back into the TOC. They weren’t there the next night, but I noticed them there every couple of nights, with one night something else occurred to me: that they seemed to be trying to imitate what the stars in the sky look like at night (especially with how the colors of the lights worked), and that made me think of a sort of observation post (actually, cover and concealment is what occurred to me) to watch us while not being an apparent threat by being part of the back drop of the night sky.  I noticed them for a few more weeks, but by the end of October 1995, I didn’t see them anymore. I have seen them since, but very seldom, and only one group in the sky.

It had 3 to 4 red lights like windows on the aircraft.  We stopped to watch it.  As it came closer, we realized it was nothing we could understand. The red lites moved slowly.  As one window on the back went off, another on in the front turned on. It was a slow methodical movement.  One turns off and another turns on in the front.  As if it were moving one lite at a time.  We were unable to discern a shape, only the red window like lites.  This continued until it was right next to us.  I had opened the window to see more clearly.  I even turned off the car.  There was no noise.  As we watched it almost seemed to stop and recognize that we were there and in an instant, noiselessly, shot up and away, out of site.  It was a clear nite after dark.   We were amazed and described to each other what we had seen.  We both did see the same thing. I tried to call a couple of airports, they said they didn’t know of anything that was going on.  We are an hour or so from Ft. Drum Army base, home of the 10th Mountain Division, so I thought maybe it was some stealth secret.  They told me to call some National Aeronautics organization or similar.  So I did.  They thanked me for my call and someone would get back to me in 6 to 8 weeks.  Sure.  They never did.

Looking for road signs or what ever we could my dad pointed out that the sky was black, and there were lights hovering over the tree line.   We pulled over and got out and it hovered there for another minute or so before it took off, when it took off it was gone with a blink of an eye like it had never been there before.  Looking back on it it's almost hard to remember.   After that we seen another siting in FL, PA, CA and OR.

We were on our way out to hunt deer the morning of the sighting. It was around 5am.  We stopped at ur last stop to pick up my friend.  His dad owned the farm where we were going to hunt. My brother and I were outside waiting for him.   We were standing beside my truck.  It was still very dark but the sun was on the way up.  So we could see the tree lines.  I was looking back over the fields where we would be going to hunt when this ball of flame appeared.  It was about 700 yard from us.  It came up over the tree tops and was stationary there.  As I watched it You could tell it was moving.  It moved very slowly almost not noticeable but because of the tree tops I could tell it was moving.  It moved out and over to the middle of an open field.  I would say about 100 yards from where I originally saw it.  I would say it was as big as a recliner chair.  I never took my eyes off of it and watched it and just like someone turned off a light switch it was gone.  Not gone like it to! ok off just gone like it disapeared.  Needless to say I was scared to death to go into the woods there until it got light.  We always went in the woods long before daylight but not that morning.  To this day I dont know what I saw and probably will never know. My brother and I never talked about this again.  I was watching a UFO show tonight and thought i would share this.  I used to think people were crack pots.  But what we saw was real and unexplained and people wouldnt believe my story either thats why I never told anyone.  I hope this helps verify someone elses story that may have saw something like this.,2011-03-23T00:00:00,41.1172,-78.6861

One night in what I think is August 1997, I was home in bed, and at 1 or 1:30 in the morning, my wife comes home from visiting her friend’s house with our son and daughter, along with my wife’s cousin’s daughter who was staying with us.  My wife, as soon as the door opens to our house in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, crying, hollers my name as soon as the doors open.  Annoyed, I woke up and thought she had another car accident, like maybe smacking a guard rail or the highway divider again (she’d done that once or twice), she said no, but by how bad she was crying, by this point, had me wide awake and I went down in some shorts and helped her get the kids into the house and in bed. When we were done, we went to our room and she was still crying as we sat on our bed and she began to tell me what happened, after she calmed down and drained my iced tea dry.  Then she begins her story. She had been driving on Route 209 in Sciota heading back towards Route 33 which she would get on going north to come home after she had been visiting her friend ""Beth"" and our kids played with hers (she’d been there since that afternoon around 2 I think).  She was driving along, her mind wandering as she listened to music when all of a sudden, a deer jumps in front of her and she slams on the brakes, and the car stops in the middle of the left lane (Rt 209 at this point is preparing to split between the on ramp going north, on ramp going south, and going straight under the highway Route 33, left lane was for going north on 33, while straight and south 33 were in the right hand lane). She said she waited for her heart to stop beating so fast and checking on the kids to see they were all still asleep in the car, and the deer kind of taking it’s time crossing 209 after she squealed the tires in her attempt to stop.  When she noticed, in the sky directly ahead of her a huge disk shape that lights on the outer edge of the disk (she never did tell me what arrangnment they were in or their colors), and that it was directly over the on ramp she had to use to go north.   She was too terrified to move, not believing what she was seeing. As she watched it, it moved north north-east, as it moved over a Calvary Church that you can see from the on ramp to 33 north, and a mountain north north-east of that.  She really saw how large the craft was, she said the moon was bright, and the shadow as it crossed the mountain covered the church it had passed that a moment or so later she could see it compared to the mountain and it was larger than it as at one point she could see the UFO back-dropping the mountain as it moved off north north-east along a ridge of mountains that led to a quarry a couple miles away before it disappeared. She said it made no noise, because she couldn’t hear anything through the open windows or the open moon roof from the craft, especially since she stalled the car when she stopped to not hit the deer (Ford Escort 5 speed manual transmission).  She cried harder, swearing her and the kids would disappear and no one would ever know what happened to them (she told me this as I held her as she cried in our room as she told me the story that night), it would take them and no one would know the difference. She then noticed headlights in the distance in her rear-view mirror, and realized someone else may have saw it or would know they were there, before she started the car and resumed her drive home and my time getting woken up when she opened the door. On your website you can compare rough distances as you can come along Route 209 in Brodheadsville, PA, through Sciota to the intersection with Route 33, and if you zoom in right, the Calvary Church was on Haney Road, while she stopped for the deer just a little before Bossardsville Road crosses 209 on your map, with the UFO over the lane she had to take to go north when she first saw it.

It is a little further in one but had moved closer in the other (picture above).  I took this photo in the evening of May 21, 2011. I was in Mecca for an ""umrah pilgrimage"" with my brother and his family.  I didn’t notice the strange disc until 11 days later (June 2) while I was dragging the photos into a folder. The clock tower is not only the biggest clock in the world; it is the second tallest building in the world; second only to the Burj Khalifa in Dubai so you can have an idea of the height where the UFO was hovering.

I slowed my car down a bit but didn't stop moving.  Just as my neck reached its turning point in toughs last few seconds of view I noticed it lift slowly off the ground and movie in the direction I was driving.  I took the first right turn I could which was the parking lot of Western Hills School and drove as fast as I could to try and get another glimpse of this thing.  As I got to the back of the school where the road goes over the small river in-between the two foresty areas, what ever it was it flew right over me...  I tried to see it better but my car has a small sun roof so it was hard to see.  Plus it moved fairly quickly out from behind the trees on my right, over the road and then over the trees on my left.  I continued to drive forward but didn't see it again.   As I got home (my home is right down the road) I heard the sound of jets fly by.  All I could think was, ""Did that just happen?""

With a swinging feeler type thing dangling beneath it, sounds far fetched and unbelievable.  A nearby neighbor also saw it recently, but I don't know him.  I only know of his account, because my son was walking by his house secconds after his sighting & the neighbor beckoned him over to tell him about it.

I would also like to add that on seveal occasions during the past year low flying fighter jets, have roared swiftly overhead. Horrifying sound.  I don't ! believe they are suppose to have practice drills over residental areas.  The first F-16 we saw & couldn't help but hear, dipped and soared above our town on the same day that New Yorkers saw & heard the F-16s flying over the Statue Of Liberty.  Last year. I never believed the explanation that made the news.  Something else was going on that day.

I got out of my car and watched as they first turned in a direction heading toward Phoenix (I-17), weaving in and out of each others' path, then (as if they knew I was watching them) they started heading toward me- toward the direction of downtown Prescott.  This was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the sun was still out, the sky was bright and completely cloudless, so I could see them perfectly.   They were nothing but balls of orange light, flickering and roiling in hue, two or three times bigger than a plane.  They moved at a moderate pace, weaving (when I say that I mean, they weren't flying in a straight line), and as they passed overhead, one vanished completely (like a flame going out), then the other did, then one reappeared, then the other reappeared, then they each vanished completely.   I stared hard at them, but there wasn't even an outline of them- completely vanished.   I was shaking, in complete disbelief at what I'd just seen.

It was an intense golden colour  surrounded by an orange halo effect, i would estimate it appeared to be roughly 4 times the apparent size of Jupiter, which was visible in the South.  I called my friend's attention to the light which was travelling far too  quickly to be a Chinese lantern.  The object was on a West by North to East by South trajectory appropriately 30 degrees above the horizon.  We could hear no engine noise and I had time to reach the back door and open it to hear no noise before it vanished. The weather conditions at the time were clear skies, temperature of about -4 degrees Celsius with calm conditions, what little breeze there was was from a SW direction and was measured at 2 K mph by local weather stations. The ISS was on the other side of the world and this object, I would estimate had an apparent magnitude of about -6, ergo brighter than the ISS ever appears to be and considerably brighter than  Venus. 9it is hard to estimate the objects height. First assumption was Chinese Lantern  but it moved wholly to quickly to be unpowered and simply blown by any wind. Given the brightness of the object, had it been a helicopter or aircraft light, the noise of the engines should have been plainly audible even through double glazed windows. Having managed to make it to the back door to open it as the object was passing from view, again had it been an aircraft or helicopter there should have been audible engine noise, however there was none. I estimate the object covered 3/5 ths of the visible sky , from my back garden, in 10-12 seconds. The object would have been spotted earlier but for a curtain being drawn across 1/3 of the room's window. I would further pint out that the object caught my eye, the other witness was facing away from the window, whilst watching TV from a lit room, 1x 100 watt bulb, 2 x 60 watt lamps, which again gives some idea of how intensely bright the light was. There are two airports in the vicinity of Coventry,  Baginton, to the South East of Coventry itself and Birmingham international, some 15 miles North West of Coventry. I am use to seeing traffic around the area , including police and rescue helicopters. I have not, as yet, seen any such craft  carrying only a single  visible light commensurate with that we saw tonight and neither has my co witness, who lives in an apartment block close by and has a great view of the sky most nights.

This took place in Hudson Quebec, Canada, Dec 25, 2010, Christmas evening, at  9:15EST pm. My wife and I, and my two children aged 26 and 22, were visiting my nephew who lives there.  We were at a gathering of family to celebrate Christmas, a dinner. My daughter had a few pieces of fireworks left over from the summertime.  After supper we all decided to walk over to a schoolyard clearing, a block away, to launch them. There was about a foot of hard snow on the ground and the temperature late that afternoon was between -10 and -15 degrees below zero (Celsius). There was no wind. There were 16 of us in all, including three young children. All the others were adults, ages 22 through 60. My nephew, who's home we were visiting, and a friend of his were present. Both are experienced commercial pilots. I myself am a retired mechanical engineer, aged 60. There were several other professionals among us as well. I set up a few firework sticks in the ground and proceeded to fire them off. There were a total of about 8 pieces, five of which shot simple 'light balls', high up.   I was in charge of the fireworks; the others were situated about 50 feet away for safety. There was one fairly bright streetlight just off to the north-west side of the group.  I was at the bottom of a very slight hill; the others were at the top of the hill. The sky was generally clear, though very slightly hazy in areas,. Stars could easily be seen through this haziness.  The moon was well off in the horizon and had not yet come into our view. At the end of the final launch, the whole of which took about 10 minutes, one of our girls called out something to the likes of, "" Oh, what are those?"".  We all looked up to the West sky, for me partly obscured  by the streetlight. It helped to block out the streetlight with my hand extended, in order to see the objects better.  I then quickly proceeded up the short hill to a better viewing point. We ALL witnessed what I can only describe as two glowing ORBS, transitioning from a copper-red, to a golden-white hue (somewhat pulsing)  Their size appeared (comparatively) roughly 10 times the diameter of the planet Jupiter, though not 10x as bright. They were not spectacularly bright, not dull, but clearly visible. If there had been any clear shape patterns/or distortions they would have been noticed. The shapes remained basically oval/spherical. One pilot estimated  the distances to be roughly  2 kilometers away at elevations of about 2000-3000 feet or so, angled at about 40-50 degrees above the horizon.  The other pilot ventured a height of about 1000ft and perhaps only a kilometer away. A couple of us had seen what was most likely a plane passing far overhead and far above the ORBS, and estimated it to be at perhaps 4000 to 10,000 feet (PET airport is about 50km away)  The ORBS were very clearly visible and well below any cloud mist, the whole of the observed time. I quickly asked if anyone had brought with them a camera. No one answered to the affirmative, even though we  had many cameras back at the house, just a block away. Nevertheless, my niece had indeed brought her old cell-phone camera and had tried to snap a picture. She and her companion reported that the picture did not come out, believing either that there was not enough light or that she was not able to get the objects into focus within that short time they presented themselves to us. The ORBS were present to our viewing only for about 3-4 minutes, from the time we first discovered them... they may have been there longer, but not observed by us. The ORBS were moving slowly in a roughly easterly direction (parallel to the Ottawa river, nearby). They made NO sound that anyone could hear, and we all had stopped to listen. We were looking at them and they were traveling in our direction, at least at first notice. It was shortly after the fireworks show that we first noticed them. Within the subsequent minute, the ORB at the left appeared to come to a full stop, and did not change in brightness, except for the color changes (about one full cycle per 3 seconds). The second varied at what appeared to be the same rate. This variation transitioned smoothly/continuously, and not in any abrupt off-on manner.   The ORB on the right appeared at first to be about the width of 3-4 fingers apart (held at arms length) from the ORB on the left. It stopped momentarily, dimmed, and then commenced to brighten slowly (until it roughly matched that of the ORD on the left), all while moving forward (or downward) as the other ORB remained put. This movement entailed a short (clockwise) bending pattern movement, then coming around  into  a straighter path, to eventually arrive at a position much closer to the ORB on the left (one finger width). I thought at one instant that it was going to connect up with the other. At that point it stayed put and the ORB on the left waited, then slowly moved into a new path towards the south-south-west. Shortly afterword, the second ORB slowly began to move in that same direction, following the other precisely. Both went on their way into the distance and faded out of sight within the 3rd-4th minutes (like fading embers). It really appeared to me that these objects had been observing us and had only changed direction after having noticed that our show was over, or that they had been discovered. In discussing with the pilots, they decided to 'call in' to their professional contacts to see if any planes were in the area, at this level, perhaps explaining the observations. Two calls were made. There were no confirmations, at that point, of any such low flights. We conjectured:    None of the lights were typical of any known plane 'standards', that the pilots could think of. There were NO sounds at all, if one were trying to consider helicopters in the area, as a possible cause. The amazing coincidence of two objects seemingly communicating with each other, on Christmas evening, at this hour, was very unusual. In particular, the coincidence of our lighting off fireworks (or anyone doing so on this day), and the timing of the ORBS appearance, seems inexplicable. Their substantial change in direction within a minute of our observing them is equally uncanny... they seemed to be watching us. The transitioning lights were not beams of light shining down onto the earth nor into the sky; there were No traces in the slightly misty air. The 'entire' objects were clearly glowing, as opposed to lights on the objects; this is unusual. Just before I showed up to light off the fireworks, (the others had arrived at the clearing about 5 minutes before me), my daughter was explaining to one of the pilots about how her dad was very interested in the subject of UFOs. They were joking of course about it all and then, this new experience occurred. Also, one of the fireworks pieces was called 'alien invasion' and my wife was calling out to bring on the aliens, in gesture only. Very weird coincidences indeed. All this was a very real experience that can be confirmed by all present. The three children were unfortunately quite upset and frightened by the sighting. It took us a few hours to calm them afterwards and convince them of some alternate acceptable explanation for all this.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,45.4583,-74.1473

It happened at night (around 10:30 pm) so I could not tell if it was a rectangle or an oval.  The shape of the windows lead me to believe that it probably had the shape of a rectangle.  I honestly don't know how long, large or what the shape of the object was outside.  From the time I saw it until the time I pulled into my garage took about about 5 minutes, max.   It was not moving.   As I approached my house I lost sight of it because my home is at the bottom of a small hill and the trees blocked my vision. I am sorry to say that I did not leave my garage to further investigate.  What caught my attention was that it was not moving and that it had, what appeared to be, four, rectangular windows that were lit up.  The light seemed to be incandescent and not fluorescent.

My first thought was that it was a cloud or a haze of smoke -- looking closer, I realized it was composed of individual objects, maybe 50 or so.  They were dark grey in color, just light enough to be seen against the night sky.  I don't believe they gave off their own light, but rather were reflecting it.  It was flying at about the height and speed of an airplane.   We kept staring at it, trying to figure out what it was -- she suggested a flock of birds, which seemed to fit for a moment, but the longer we looked the more we realized it was definitely not birds.   The objects weren’t moving independently, but as a perfect cohesive unit.  It was flying in a formation, but the objects remained perfectly spaced from one another, to the point where it looked like a grid or a net in the sky.   Then, the objects began to shift and change positions.  It gave the appearance of a morphing, shifting net.   It was 3-dimensional in the way that it moved, and very geometric.  It drifted directly overhead and then slowly out of sight. We didn’t take our eyes off it the entire time.

The radio was playing the song ""E.T. (Futuristic Lover)"" by Katy Perry.  I told my roommate, ""I think this song is about an alien.  Listen to the lyrics.""   I then turned up the radio for us both to hear the lyrics.  That happened for about ten to twenty seconds before both of us saw strange yellow lights up in the sky. The best way I can describe what we saw is that there was a cluster of yellow lights together in what formed a ball-like shaped formation.  Underneath that cluster were three more yellow lights spaced farther away from eachother, in what looked like an angled triangle shape.  All the yellow lights seemed to stand still in the sky together as either a formation of different lights or crafts, or as one craft with many lights (I am not sure which). After seeing it, I asked my roommate, ""What the hell is that?!""   My roommate responded similarly saying, ""That does look weird!""   We decided that I would park my vehicle somewhere to view it.  I parked my vehicle on the side of a street, and we got out of my vehicle to view it.  Once we saw it again, the ball-like cluster of lights was gone, however the three lights that were underneath it before were still visible, and were still in an angled triangle formation.   The three lights that were left then started slowly dissolving or disappearing one at a time, till there was one light left in the sky, and then that last light then dissolved or disappeared. I saw a bystander walking near us.  I told him, ""We just saw a UFO.""  He said he saw it too.  I asked him what it was.  He told me, ""You just said it.""   I also asked my roommate if he saw what I saw, and he said yes.  He is just as amazed as I am on what we saw.  He is also willing to serve as a witness to this event. This UFO, when all the lights (ball cluster lights plus three triangle lights) were visible was very large and took up a good size portion of the sky.   For me personally, this was the third UFO I ever saw in my life, and the most amazing.

Ironically, I was also thinking how cool it would be to see another daytime UFO (I had witnessed 2 prior to this sighting back in 2009). As I'm standing there gazing up at the sky I immediately noticed a large black bird and while looking at the bird happened to see a white, shiny object right next to it but at a much higher altitude.  Obviously, my attention was then focused on the object. At first I believed it was an airplane because we see them often flying in and out of TIA about 25 miles away.  But, as I looked closer, I noticed there were no wings on this craft!  Even at a very high altitude, the wings of planes are easily visible on a clear day, especially when they fly directly overhead as this object did. here were only a few small clouds in the sky today so that was not an issue. This object was flying at approx 25,000-30,000 ft yet, it flew slower than normal aircraft. The object appeared to be a white, shiny material (since the sun was reflecting off part of the craft) and flew from east to west, towards the Gulf of Mexico. It was the size of a grain of rice held at arm's length and the same shape too. It made no noticeable sound. Whenever airplanes fly over us, they are easily heard and recognized as plane. They can be quite loud. I lost sight of the object when the bus pulled up and my attention drawn away.  When the bus left and my kids and I were walking back up the driveway to our house, I stopped and tried to find it again but, it was gone.  In 2009 I saw and reported an identical craft flying from west to east and disappearing into a narrow but very tall, cylindrical shaped cloud.

PD)) On the night of April the 29th, 2011, sometime around midnight, several of my friends and I spent the evening at an outdoor party in the valley wrapped around Douglas Creek--about 10 miles from the small town of Douglas.  This party happens every year. My friends and I gathered around our campsite, looking into the clear night sky.   We could see every star. As we watched, my friend grabbed my arm and pointed to the west.   We could see a bright light--a star, as it appeared.   We noted the light as it intensified. I became thrilled--this star is becoming brighter. We watched the star become brighter, and brighter.  Within a moment, the star became so bright, we could nolonger see the smaller stars in the sky. We realized that this light was in our atmosphere.  And because it remained in a fixed position in the sky while intensifying in brightness, we conjectured we were looking at a satellite, and it appeared to be travelling in our direction. After about a minute, maybe two, the intensifying light which appeared fixed in its position in the sky began to move east in an eliptical direction around the area--it never flew directly over us. At this point, we started getting excited. We were sure this was some kind of satellite, and that it was going to hit the earth.  It was moving at very high speed, much faster than any plane.  Yet, we heard nothing. It moved around Douglas Creek, traveling east toward the horizon.  The light appeared to be flying low enough to hit the mountainside on the eastern side of the valley.  We watched eagerly to see the collision. Well, the light traveled east toward the Horizon, but stopped above the mountainside--still several hundered feet in the air.  It stood fixed in the sky, as it had when we saw it in the west a moment earlier. At this point we became really excited.  We watched this light, fixed in the eastern sky, intensify as it had when we first saw it, and it slowely faded to black. The truely amazing thing about this sighting was the intensity of the light.  It lit the entire sky.  The night was still, and we could see every star in the sky before.  However, this light overpowered all others as it closed in. While we watched, all other stars faded.  When the light disappeared, all was calm and clear as it was before. I'm not sure what we saw--None of us are sure what we saw.  It was very interesting. I told many of my friends and co-workers, and I heard of some local legends of ""spooklights"" over Waterville, a small town outside of Doulgas, our location.   After hearing of this, I did some research, and saw some local reports of this strange phenomena; however, the videos of these ""spooklights"" is not what we saw.  What we saw did not change directions, and didn't move as quickly.  What we saw was a single, much brighter--white light--not a dim orange light.  And this light looked like a star, at first, as it stood fixed in the west.  Then the light looked like an aircraft as it travelled east.  Before the light disappeared, it looked more like a star, again, as it had in the west before it moved.  It was all very bizzare. I hope this information will be helpfull at some point.  I'm not a UFO buff, by any means, but what I saw blew my mind.  I will never forget the odd behavior of this light--like nothing I could have imagined. Take care.  Good fortune in future endeavors.",2011-05-12T00:00:00,,

Returning home at around 9:30 P.M., I unlocked the door to the open deck which leads to my (top) 2nd floor apartment.  The deck provides a generous view of the sky, and my gaze was momentarily drawn toward several aircraft transiting nearby.  As we are within 2 miles of the local airport, this is not an unusual occurrence.  What was unusual was then noticing what at first appeared to be a V formation (the point toward direction of travel) of balloons flying rapidly over my apartment and disappearing beyond the roof-line. These were round or oblong objects, silent, non-illuminated, but visible because their somewhat matte surfaces reflected ground light.  They appeared to be at an elevation of anywhere from 800 to 6000 feet - difficult to judge in the dark night sky, but even at the lower elevation extreme would have been traveling at a velocity considerably in excess of balloons, birds, or even private aircraft.  Of course as there were between 12-14 round, discreet objects in this formation, they were clearly not planes and obviously not birds.  Passing overhead, the formation was about the size of 4 fingers held at arms length, flying West to East (from the ocean to inland) and they were visible for about 8-10 seconds. When first spotted at about 60 degrees above the horizon, they appeared to be a rigid, single, solid object with dim evenly-spaced lights defining a 90 degree angle V, but as they came toward my location I realized they were individual objects, some of which suddenly seemed almost to cavort with one another while still maintaining a loose V formation, though at an overall constant velocity. I quickly moved to a more unobstructed area of my deck, and was rewarded several minutes later by another formation flying in the same West to East corridor over my home.  Several more minutes and a third formation.  There was no wind at ground level, so I thought if these are balloons then the jet stream must be mighty low.   By the fourth formation, each one of which varied in total size from approximately 9 to 15 objects, the flight path was no longer overhead and was now Northwest to Southeast.   Another 5-8 minutes, and a Southeast to Northwest formation.  I realized then that these could not be balloons as they were flying in opposite directions and at quite a good clip.  A sixth formation, now after 10 P.M., flew exactly South to North.  Some of these had maintained a fairly fixed, evenly spaced ninety degree formation, while others exhibited the peculiar pooling and scattering behavior as they transited in a looser formation. My conclusion: it was a busy night overhead.   What I saw eludes a conventional explanation i.e. birds, balloons, private or commercial aircraft, known military aircraft - hence this report.  I don't therefore assume these to be of extraterrestrial provenance, although that remains one possibility. Secret military aircraft?  Possible - but that would be a lot of secret aircraft to throw at one relatively small section of sky in such a short period of time over a densely populated area.  Not likely.  And not likely I'll ever find out.   Now I'm going to bed.",2011-05-12T00:00:00,34.02342753378378,-118.48167652027027

I quickly realized that was not what I was seeing however when the three reddish/orange lights veered from my view to the right at the same time. My second thought was perhaps they were  three birds, as I could not easily discern the size and distance of the objects against the starry black sky. I thought this because they were completely silent as they flew. I readily dismissed this theory however as the had no wing ""flapping"" movement that I would easily have detected were they birds. The three objects moved swiftly across the sky and were lost to my sight as the flew to the right of where I was lying on the ground and I lost track of them as they flew toward the well lit city lights. It did not appear that these objects were lights from a single object as I remember detecting the night sky between them as they quickly passed directly overhead. I have never before seen Unidentified Flying Objects and seeing this really got my skin tingling. I have no idea what I saw...but whatever it or they were, was out of the ordinary. Perhaps they have something to do with the military/observatory being built atop Haleakala Crater. I would be very interested in knowing if any others saw this phenomena.

I looked through the front windshield of the vehicle and observed an object overhead with an orange light being emitted but could not identify it immediately.  The object was triangular with rounded edges and appeared to be traveling in a rough south-east to north-west direction moving over S.Bell St. toward I-27 and the Arden Rd.area. I rolled down the window and stuck my head out of the vehicle to get a better look at it and I observed the object to be flying low just over the power lines and moving rather leisurely and I at this point realized that the craft did not have wings or rotors or landing struts.  The object appeared to slow just long enough for me to study its underside and I observed tha! t the skin of the craft appeared beige in color and textured and the craft itself was about the size of a full moon if not slightly larger.  There was an individual non-blinking orange light illuminating the craft and the craft made no sound.  I noticed that the craft appeared to warble slightly as it followed its trajectory. I requested to my friend that we should follow it and he immediately turned right onto Ventura Dr and stopped. We both observed the back of the craft which was illuminated orange and observed it to move over I-27 and then slowly bank to the left behind a billboard and downward toward Arden Rd.  We lost sight of it at that point and continued on to our destination.  After we started our return home we briefly drove to where we thought the craft was trying to land and found nothing.  We placed a call, upon arriving back home to the local private airport, Tradewinds Airport, and inquired about light aircraft being in the area. We were told that they were ! unaware of any aircraft in the area in question.  They stated ! however that occasionally the Randall County Sheriffs Dept flies their helicopter with unusual lights equipped.

This object first caught my attention because it was so bright I could see it through the closed blinds of my window.  I live on the water of Saginaw Bay and this object was so low to horizon that I first thought it was some kind of Coast Guard boat because it had blue light as well as a bright white light.   When I first came outside to look at it through my binoculars the bright white light faded to a dark amber color it moved slowly out into the bay randomly flashing very brightly.  It did not flash at regular intervals like most lights out on the bay, it behaved as if were on a dimmer switch.   When it began moving back inland I got more curious because that's a very strange thing for any watercraft out on the bay to do especially this late at night.  It would move slowly out into the bay then back again several times.   This light was several miles away very low to the horizon and when at its brightest it was lighting the ground on the beach in front of m! y house.   Now the story gets more interesting, the light which moved slowly until now began moving at high speed out into the bay, much faster than any boat could move.   I woke up my Father at this point so he could come take a look at it also.   I went back to my binoculars and as my Father was walking out the object faded in brightness, again as if on a dimmer switch.   At this point my Dad and I noticed a helicopter flying out into the bay towards the direction of the UFO.  The helicopter began flying what I assume was a search pattern in the area near where I had just seen it fade away.  It did this for awhile then flew quickly north and back again to near where the object disappeared. and began to appear to search again.   The helicopter then flew away to the east, the UFO never reappeared.  I should mention this object was also red at times including while it was moving at high speed out into the bay.   There was an obvious difference in the helicopter searching the area and! this UFO.  The way it changed direction and sometimes appeared to hov er indicates to me that it was either another helicopter with lights I've never seen before or something unidentified.

I am a first-shift investment casting foundry technician and I could not sleep, so I went on a night walk up my rural road exactly 2/3 of a mile away from my home past the cemetery where my road intersects with a somewhat decently traveled highway.  There is little to no congestion or traffic whatsoever after midnight on these roads, so it was completely silent and sort of eerie to be honest.  I was alone and all I could hear was wind and the distant rumbling of deer scattering in the forests.  Anyways, fresh air usually does me in and I had off today.   Instantaneously, overhead of out of the blue, I saw crimson lights flashing and the object hovered and stood stationary 300 yards from me, only 200 feet in the air.  I was scared and in a state of shock, so I immediately ran for some cover in thick shrubs.  I was questioning if I was sleep-walking, or if this was really happening; basically wondering if I was sane.  Nothing out of the paranormal has ever happened with or to me, so I did not know how to react.   This object started out as a single beam of crimson light as a bath-tub shaped object.  It was irregular and erratic, but it eventually illuminated and almost burst like a cocoon I compare it to.  It turned into a small orb, triangular/pyramid shape after 28 minutes of fluttering in one spot (no more than moving 75 feet at all in total distance).   Its light at this point was like a beacon from a lighthouse and it was emerald green.  It folded up like origami almost and disappeared without a trace within 8 seconds after the 28th minute of my sighting.  It looked like jet lag was left behind, but it emitted a clearly amber haze in the air that lasted for over an hour after it left.  I was bewildered and headed home and thought about what just went down.  I wasn't sure if it was extraterrestrial or if it was somehow related to the graveyard.  Either way, I was frightened and astonished at the same time.   It had 2 central lights, beams.  One was crimson that lasted the whole time, and the other was green, and tha t only was viewed by me right before the object went in an upward projection and disappeared straight up.  It was a single craft, and went from ovalish/oblong shaped to pyramid-shaped at the end. I don't know the craft's intent.   It stood still most of the time, no ambience was heard by me coming from it.  I figured this would be the best outlet to report my observations rather than calling the local police and having them think  I am a kook.  I also observed an odd object of the same type outside my window again this morning at 6:39 am, central time.  It was the same object as before, and was 10 feet wide and 3 feet high.   It hovered and disappeared after 6 minutes and 36 seconds.",2011-06-20T00:00:00,,

The craft appeared to be silver or light in color, as it reflected the sun and made no noise and left no chemtrail.   Though strange, the event seemed insignificant until another identical craft came into view less than one minute later, following the same altitude and path.  The two original witnesses were then joined by two additional persons, and they all continued to watch as three more of the same type of crafts followed, appearing about one minute apart.   The only difference in the three subsequent crafts was that they were still appearing to adhere to the same directional path but flew lower or higher than the originial two. No more than five minutes later, another craft appeared coming from the opposite direction of the original five, this one flying from southeast to northwest.  Speed and altitude were similar but the craft seemed orange in color (perhaps a reflection of the setting sun which was an orange/pink hue).   Then rather quickly, perhaps within thirty seconds of the former, another craft was seen flying from the original north position, but was traveling southwest, instead of directly south.  Occurring at the same time, an easily discernible commercial plane was flying from south to north.   Following closely behind but at a slower speed, characteristic of the other unidentified crafts, another craft travels from southeast to northwest.   Traveling parallel but in the exact opposite direction, another one of the crafts is seen. The two parallel crafts appear from the naked eye and with aid of a digital camera, to be dangerously close to one another. (Never seen with commercial flights.)  Their average speeds appeared to be ""too slow"" for any familiar craft at such low altitudes.  This was apparent to the original witness, of military background, but obvious to the other witnesses as well.   Moments after the previous three were witnessed all at once, a dark or black craft of indiscernible shape was seen traveling from northeast to southwest, but was on a completely separate path than any of the other crafts.   During the entire event, one witness was using an application (PlaneFinder) on his iPhone, which turned up NO commercial flights at the time, with the exception of the obvious aforementioned flight. The entire event lasted approximately thirty minutes, with no more activity observed from the witnesses for the additional half hour they remained outside.",2011-06-20T00:00:00,36.7804,-80.7091

Shortly after passing through the town of Krum on FM 1173 I noticed two orbs in the sky fairly close together.  There is not much skylight here because it is very rural, so the stars are easily noticed on a clear night.  The moon was easily seen, but the stars were not because of cloud cover.  These two orbs were very evident ahead of me on the left side of the road.  The closer I got, I could rule out approaching planes to DFW Airport.  They were too low and barely moving.  More like a hover..  the outline of the crafts had a white/gold light.  Red light was also noticed.  As I ruled out possible explanations, I decided not to call 911 or my Onstar emergency button.   A.) They probably would not believe me and  B.)  What could they do?  So I called my daughter who was home, to have a “witness” and in case I didn’t get home. During that call, one craft disappeared. I described the other and by this time I could loo! k underneath the craft.  There were red and white round lights under it. Maybe 5 or 6 and not symmetrical.  I looked for the other one.  It was now on the right side of the road.  Those lights were turned off, except some dim red light underneath, but I could see the outline of the craft.  There was some movement from the orbs but very little.  I passed them. When I looked back, I could no longer see either of the orbs.

It was January 14 and I was out late working.  When I had finally finished with my job, I headed home just like any other night.  On my way home I picked up my sister from a friend's house and we continued driving home, with the music turned up very loud. I probably wouldn't have witnessed what I did in the next few minutes if it hadn't been for the vibration.  Wisconsin is not well known for earthquakes and so I was suprised when I felt the car vibrating slightly, and then progressively more harshly.  Harshly enough to make me stop the car.  Unfortunately, stopping the car did not stop the vibration. At this point my sister looked very freaked out and I felt the same way.  Once the car rolled to a stop I got out and noticed that the groung was suprisingly sturdy, despite the shaking car.  The vibrating had been going on for about two minutes and it didn't seem to be going away.  As I looked around outside the car I didn't see anything.  It was a very dark on the back road we were on.  I could see the city lights ahead but we weren't close enough to call out to anyone, and we couldn't have if we wanted to because the car was vibrating so loudly. Suddenly, the car stopped vibrating and the engine cut out.  My sister was very quiet too, though she had been yelling at me just a second ago.  Now it had been six minutes since the whole ordeal started. It was eerie becuase at the moment the engine died, it felt as though all of the hair on my body was standing on end.  Then, in my perephrial vision, I saw this kind of glowing light in the sky. I turned to face the light full on and I realized that it wasn't just one glowing light, it was a large mass with small lights lining the edge of it.  It was a sliverish-blue color and I couldn't really make out the shape becuase as I stared at it, it didn't really seem to be holding a specific shape or color.  It was hovering a little to the left of our car and it didn't seem to be that high above us, maybe 200 feet.  By this time my sister had noticed it too, and she was not taking the sighting well.  She jumped out of the car and tried to get me to go back into it so that we coul! d drive away.  I gave her the keys and told her to start it.  She tried but it didn't work, the engine didn't even sputter. The whole time she tried to start the car, I stared at the object in the sky.  It didn't move, but the shape still seemed to shift and the colors subtly did, too.  I stood watching the object for about three minutes while my sister messed with the car.  Then all at once our car started, the lights on the object went out (except for the feint glow that seemed to perpetually surround it), and the object emitted a sound. It was unlike anything I had ever heard before.  The noise was loud enough to make both my sister and I cover our ears, and it seemed to make everything shake.  It was a deep bass and it felt as though it passed through me becuase my ribcage was vibrating along with my surroundings.  This went on for about a minute, and when it finally stopped it seemed like an eternity had passed. When I looked up the next time, the sky was empty.  There was no evidence that anything had been there, and it was already beginning to feel as though it had all been a dream.  I stumbled back to the car and found my sister sitting wide-eyed, once again in the passenger seat. We stayed there for a good 30 minutes after this event, talking about what had happened.  We both decided not to call the police or talk to anyone else about the sighting, becuase we figured no one in their right minds would believe us.  We weren't even sure that we believed our own eyes.  Neither of us have talked about it to anyone besides each other until this day, when we were led to this website after reading an article about UFO sightings featured on MSN's homepage.

Three years ago in Knoxville TN, my home town, I witnessed my first UFO.  What i saw changed my life, my perception of how i understood physics, and what i once viewed as possible and impossible.  I have always been interested in the paranormal, since my first memories i can recall an interest in ghosts, spirits, angels aliens etc.. but overall i am a pretty sound and logical person.  The details of my first sighting were pretty much exactly the same as what is described by eyewitnesses of the famous Phoenix lights, but that's not why I'm here.  I'm here because this morning at 1:30am, I witnessed something that frightened me to my very core.  Unlike my other UFO sighting experiences in which i was not frightened, just fascinated and curious about the possibilites of what i was seeing i felt a combination of peace, warmth, and awe. what i witnessed tonite was completely different.  I had just gotten home from a little late night shopping at wal-mart.  The time was around 1:30am and i was walking out of my bathroom and down the stairs to my basement to smoke a cigarette, when i heard a very loud rumble as if a tornado was directly over my home.  It was such a loud humming/rumbling sound that i could literally feel the vibration from it.  Curious, i walked out my front door expecting to see a helicopter flying directly over or a low flying jet, but... that is not at all what i saw.  I open the door, and directly in front of my point of view was an ENOURMOUS, solid carbon/black perfect circle shaped craft hovering extremely low and close to my home. The sound was loud enough that i'm surprised... better yet shocked that it didn't wake the whole neighborhood.   Again, this thing was huge.  In the dead center of this giant circular craft (Which i could see almost perfectly, and it had no wings, no landing gear, no strobing lights and no visible markings of any kin! d) was an extremely bright laser like lighting blue beam pointing in several different directions. I have to admit, i was frightened by it, but i wanted to document it somehow. Now, i own a video camera, but i keep forgetting to purchase new film, and did not have any in it at the time, which REALLY sucked. So, since option 1 was out of the question i ran to get my iphone from off my counter top. Here's what is strangest part of the story. By the time i got back outside with my phone in hand, this thing, this craft, this... sort of ominous eye of god ship had left. I could still hear it, it was still very loud, and knew it had to be near by. Mind you, I was in the house for all of 15 seconds searching for my iphone. I ran as fast as i could in house shoes around to the back of my house hoping to catch a final glimpse. This craft (or whatever you want to call it) had traveled several miles north, and all i could see was the faint remnant of the beam shooting out of it, and i! t was rotating up and down and back in forth as if it was sear! ching fo r something, and then it dissapeared behind the ridgeline, although the noise emminating was still very noticeable. Wait it gets weirder. SO i hear another loud rumble coming from behind me, althought this sound is familiar. I look up, and there 3 black helicopters with only their spotlights on in formation flying along the same path the craft took, as if they were chasing after it. These choppers were hauling major ass. I knew i had just witnessed something i was not supposed to see. I will remember this day forever, and the unusual ominous sense of fear i got from witnessing this thing. If you would like, i am a bit of an artist, i could send a detailed sketch at a later date. Thank you for your time.",2011-01-31T00:00:00,35.96156134085213,-83.98011528822055

It went on for about a half hour before I couldn't stand listening any longer.   The next time I turned on the radio a normal sounding, (Chicago?), symphonic station was playing.  I haven't heard anything like it before, or since that time. It was very scary, repetitive, yet always different. I think it must have been some form of music.  There was some kind of pig creature talking/or perhaps singing.  It made a guttural sound that no human could possibly make, (it sounded like it had a massive chest cavity).   In the background was a constant overwhelming clanging, coupled with a buzzing that seemed to fade in and out.  Occasionally I could pick out what sounded like human screams in the background.  Like someone in excruciating pain, or someone suddenly facing some dreadful unavoidable consequence.  There was tons of ambiance.  Ambiance everywhere, in the pig man's voice, the buzzing and clanging, even in the screams buried far off in the background somewhere.   I know the AM band can skip, but I have to believe this was something different.  It was either a very strange broadcast for 1970 and the radio station it was found on; or was it something beyond this world?   I am sorry I do not know what frequency it was.   My dad changed the station to listen to the WGN grain prices.  I remember the radio station indicator being slightly right of center, I'm sorry I cannot be more specific.  I would definitely recognize this if I could hear it again.  The problem is, it seems to be gone, and it has been 41 years now.

On Old Buddington Road two young adult males (as told to me by one of the same) were outside when an app. 300Yd triangular craft slowly and silently passed overhead at a hgt. of 1000ft.  Witness said oddly silent but felt an odd vibration throughout his body as it passed directly overhead. He also described it as seemingly like a helicopter until it got closer.  It had a light at each corner and a large round light in the center which  beamed to the ground. This is all Ive heard.

We were sleeping outside looking up at the stars when we noticed a large, bright, yellowish orange light moving from West to East in the Southern sky. The light was constant, meaning it did not blink. It moved at the speed of a lower flying commercial aircraft, but emitted no noise. It travelled at a constant speed and we watched until it disappeared on the Eastern Horizon.  We have both seen hundreds of satellites in our lives and this was definitely far too bright, moved too quickly, and appeared to be too close to be a satellite. It was especially odd that it made no sound.

The long thin-lit object about 30-40 feet wide, appears to have two lights set in the middle, as it was flying over the bay.

I saw a bright orange object moving fast towards me from the southeast. It looked low on the horizon but when it got over me, it looked like a big type of kite or parachute, with an arched rectangular- shaped top and a bright orange bright light underneath it. I was able to look right up at the shape as it passed over my head. The object kept moving toward the north, seeming to get higher and then disappeared upwards into the sky. I turned my head and saw another one moving towards me. This one also moved to the north, but headed more west, disappearing upwards into the sky. I turned my head, and another one was coming, appearing so low that I wondered if it was going to land somewhere.  I was thinking that a bunch of extreme junkies maybe planned a jump off Mt Si with lights on their kites but they must have been motorized because they were moving fast. The big kite-shaped objects  would then hesitate a little directly above me and then gain altitude as they moved away. More and more kept coming from the same direction, from the south east side of the mountain. A couple stayed above me for a half-minute or so and then went straight up, disappearing into the sky. At one point, I watched one begin to move away, towards the west, and a small plane’s lights were right next to it and I wondered if the pilot was going to hit it. The small plane had been much higher in the sky than these objects, but the object quickly gained altitude next to the plane before it disappeared. By now, I figured out that these were not kites and called my sister, telling her that I was watching some very strange things in the sky above me.  Several more came my way, one even appeared to turn and go backwards before it went straight up. A couple others hovered longer over me and then went straight up. I just remember watching them one by one and then turning my head to see another one coming and could see others behind it, like they were all behind each other, following each other. The size was hard to tell. When they first were heading my way, they looked about the size of big kites or parachutes but the bright orange glow under them distorted the size. They actually looked bigger when they got right over me. Then, it looked like the size of a small plane maybe. They were totally silent and moved very fast as they approached and left, appearing to slow down sometimes before they hovered. I think I counted 12 before they stopped coming. The whole experience lasted between 10 and 15 minutes.",2011-04-03T00:00:00,47.4793,-121.543

As I turned the corner onto my road, I lost sight of the light. It was traveling west at a steady slow pace.  I saw a second orange light about 1/2 mile up the road, traveling parallel to the first light in the same direction.  These lights were very bright and non-blinking. I pulled into my driveway and parked quickly, getting out to watch it move over the yard into the woods.  My husband came out to see it and concluded it was a helicopter, then went back inside.  I continued to watch and heard my neighbors remarking about the orange light in the next yard.  They also didn't know what it was.  The light glimmered, like it was sputtering out, then disappeared over the edge of the trees. There were planes in the sky at the same time, and these were all much higher altitude than these lights were.  The planes all had white and red lights and were blinking.  I could hear the sound of the planes passing, but did not hear anything I would have attributed to these flying objects. If I had to guess altitude, I would have said about 300 feet to 1 mile up at most.  It was hard to gauge how big they were since it was just an oval glowing light.

I will separate facts, things I know for sure, definitely saw and could find no other explanation for.  The rest will be put in a category for speculation, what I may have seen, what might have meant something, things with potential other explanations. Summary of Events Sitting in a friends place at around 23:45 that night, my 2 friends and I decided to go out to the hot tub in his backyard. We got to talking about the sky and how unusually red it was; I attempted to explain that it might have something to do with low cloud cover that night and the reflection of the city’s street lights. The conversation continued, we get to talking about UFOs and my friend recounts his encounter with one. I firmly believe him to be telling the truth though his is another story.  My other friend says that she doesn’t believe in that kind of stuff; we just start to discuss it a little more, trying to convince her that they are indeed quite likely real. All of a sudden, two impossibly bright blue-green flashes one after the other accompanied by a small buzzing sound from the south east interrupts our conversation. All of us very surprised at the odd timing of such a flash begin talking about it; at this point we start to hear sirens. The odd thing about these! sirens is that they don’t seem to be moving, nor do they sound like any emergency vehicle that I’ve ever heard. We hear no thunder and yet the flash was quite close, I’d say at most 5 kilometers away. Logically, had it been lightning, we should have heard thunder. Though the night is cold, we get out of the hot tub and run to the street; we have to know what it was that we saw. At the end of the street, it becomes clear that we aren’t dressed properly enough to continue searching. We run back to my friend’s house quickly, where we change and dry off in a rush. My friend who owns the house decides to stay behind. Me and my other friend then quickly get our shoes on and run back to the end of the street. We see nothing and decide to walk in the direction of the flash. As we get closer to the end of the block nearby we start to hear that same buzzing noise that accompanied the flash of light. Our eyes leap to the skies in case we happen to see something. At first there is nothing, and then suddenly we see a shape in the sky moving quickly, from the direction of the flash and with only that same buzzing sound. At first it appears to be saucer-like in shape but as it gets closer, it begins to look more like a helicopter with some fairly notable differences. No rotating chopper, nor is there any sound that would suggest it was a helicopter. The sky still a bright red color created contrast against the dark vehicle above us and allowed us to see its shape quite clearly. On one side there was a red light and on the other was a green one. At the tail end of the UFO, there was another kind of light between a long narrow cross section at the back, this one clearly different from the others; it had a luminescent glow to it and seemed to be white at! times and at others it would appear to be every color I could imagine.  It flew right over top of us with speed I’ve never seen by anything in the air before. It flew low, at most about a kilometer above us. We noticed that though it moved at least faster than the speed of sound yet there was no sonic boom to follow it, similar to the flash of light which also should have been accompanied by a loud noise. At first we struggle to wrap our heads around what we’ve just seen. Once again we hear these similar sirens, no audible movement nor, do they sound normal. We decide to continue in the direction the UFO came from and walk up to a nearby field behind a community center. Once we arrived, the sky seemed to have lost its characteristic red glow. We noticed that where there happened to be a baseball diamond in this field, the ground was completely covered in fairly smooth, unnatural ice, with a pitcher’s mound that seemed to be made of snow. The ice was quite wet, as if it had been melted recently; another odd thing about it is that there were 2 ice rinks nearby, so why the extra ice? My friend, a hockey player, tells me that the ice would do no good for skates and would quite possibly ruin them. This raises further questions; why would the snow have fallen only on some of the field or if it did fall, where was the snow that had to be moved for such a thing to be? Why was it ther! e if there seemed no obvious use to it? At this point, we look at the sky and notice the red glow seeping back in to the sky. We start to hear an odd ringing sound nearby and begin walking over to it as it seems to draw us closer. We get closer to the sound and can almost identify it when we see a car out at approximately 1:00 AM. Someone goes to the door of one house and stands there for a bit; no one answers the door, nor does he go inside. We start discussing this strange car when it starts to get closer to us. I suggest we simply go back as we’d likely seen all there was to be seen and the car was starting to freak me out a little bit. The ringing sound again, we see the man at another door down the street. Once again, no one answers, nor does he go in. We start heading back and he immediately gets back in his car, he seems to follow us, going a walking pace alongside us. Finally when it seems like he’s about to stop and do or say something, he drives away, turning right on the major street in front of us. Though this was majorly relieving, as it drove by in plain sight, I could almost swear th! at the car was completely empty. We sigh our relief and continue walking and then, we see the car again; he must have turned around in a hurry. He goes just beyond our view and seems to disappear, though we can still see the light projected on houses and street signs that seemed to come from a car stopped, just out of our vision. We decide to take another way back; hopefully we don’t see the car again that night. We follow the apparent labyrinth of back lanes that were our new route back, still hopeful that we see no cars. Every time either of us mentions that we should go back, we hear that sound again which we soon recognized to be wind chimes, though this wasn’t the windiest night. On our way walking back, neither of us could shake the feeling that there was definitely something behind us and though we looked back frequently and often in unison when that feeling seemed strongest. The sound of wind chimes accompanies us all the way back within a few houses from where we started. We started to hear a sound that seemed to come from above and to the east. This time it was different than the buzzing, it was more of a rumbling, as if this object were much bigger. We stand at the street corner and wait for the sound to approach and get clearer. We start to think that it might be a train, though it comes from a direction where the nearest train tracks are quite a ways and I rarely hear trains from that direction while in this neighborhood. The sounds starts to get louder and more rumbling, we start to feel as if it’s coming from above us, though the sky is completely covered in those ominous red clouds. It starts to pass when we actually do hear a train, though this time from the south. I cannot say if they were separate or one and the same but my gut says they were different. When the sound is gone, we cross the street to go back; once more there were wind chimes, it seems as if they don’t want us to go back. I glanced to the west in instinct and though it was a passing glance, I thought I saw a man standing in the middle of the street. When we reach the other side, my friend looks down the sidewalk to see if there was indeed a man. What we saw seemed to be of humanoid shape though in the darkness it was hard to tell. A notable characteristic of this shape was that in darkness, one’s eye might be attracted to brighter objects and areas but with this shape, it seemed as if it were the darkest thing I had ever seen. Even though it was at least 8 blocks away, it stood out very noticeably. We lose interest in this shape which does not seem to move and finally finish our journey back. We get back at approximately 2:30 AM and at this point, the sky is no longer red. After arriving we decide that neither of us wants to be inside, in case we miss something else. We head in, get changed back into our bathing suits and sit in the hot tub for the next hour and a half or so. At first there is nothing we see in our watching of the skies but after about 20 minutes in the hot tub, the wind picks up, the sky reddens once more and we start to see something, once again, flying low on the horizon, in the North West direction the UFO had first flown. It had a similar appearance, those same tell-tale red and green lights, the saucer like shape when perceived from a distance. It began to sweep across the horizon from west to east and then would turn around at some indeterminate point and travel from east to west. It continued this patter for close to an hour, getting lower with! each new sweep. When it was low enough that neither of us could see it anymore, we continued sitting in the hot tub, hoping that something else might happen. It was at that point that we had our 3rd (at least) sighting of the night. This time the UFO we saw was travelling from the west, not from the airport, though at first it looked like a plane flying low, it soon became clear that this was no plane. It was an odd shape that’s difficult to describe. It looked as if its front was its broadest point and that was where the wings started, they slowly got narrower as it got to the rear of the UFO where they attached at the back forming an almost acorn-like shape. At the tip of one wing was a green light, at the other was red one, and in the middle was a cluster of about 6 much brighter red lights. These formed a line of lights at the broadest and front-most point of the plane and right in the back was that same, whitish, rainbow colored light we had observed on the other UFO. Like the first, it passed directly over us heading east south east. We observe the first UFO, the one doing the sweep to our north is visible again shortly after, continuing its sweep, though this time getting more elevation with each passing sweep for another 5 or so minutes. Finally, it seems to disappear and the sky seems to blacken once more becoming what it is characteristically. There were a few things about this night that stood out for me even before seeing any UFOs in the sky above us. First of all, the initial flash of light happened under a minute after my friend said she didn’t believe in UFOs. Second, this was the first time in 19 years, a little longer than my whole life, that the moon was this close to the earth at the time of the full moon. It was on this specific night, where the moon was 15% bigger and 30% brighter, that we happened to have all these sightings and strange occurrences. One might say that it’s simply a coincidence but in my gut, it seems far from coincidental.  FACT The flash of light was an uncharacteristic color for lightning, blue-green, not blue-purple, though it lit up the sky. The lack of thunder also discredits this information. The UFOs, to my mind, defied logic and physics in the way the moved, the speed of it, the silence of it and the maneuverability of it were beyond anything I’ve ever seen in my life. Speculation As much as the sky, the car, the chimes and the shadow man seemed related, all are possible coincidences, things seen wrong or unnecessarily matched with the other factual occurrences.",2011-04-03T00:00:00,49.891260040733194,-97.15285022403258

My boyfriend and I were going to take a walk through my neighborhood at approximately 10 pm, Central Time.  We walked about 20 minutes before deciding to sit in an empty lot to talk and look at the night sky. After about 5 minutes of standing and looking up at the sky, I noticed a very bright, amber star in the West.  After pointing it out, I quickly noticed that it was traveling fairly quickly.   The two of us got excited, as we assumed it was a shooting star or a comet.   As it neared where we were, I vaguely noticed that it didn't seem to be descending accelerating, or extinguishing, as many space-borne objects will.  The ""comet"" continued in a steady, unfaltering path across the night towards the East.   As we continued to watch, we noticed that the object seemed to flicker very consistently, and was orb-like in nature.  This last detail is what made us question that we were seeing some meteor or shooting star.  Usually those seem to have a ""tail"" and move quicker.  My boyfriend suggested it was likely some sort of plane or helicopter.  My father, however, is an Air Traffic Controller, and has been for over 30 years.  So I am fairly familiar with what different types of aircraft look like their markers, shapes, and flight patterns, air spaces, etc.- even at night.  I assured him we had not seen a plane; I knew that for absolutely certain.  (Not to mention, there were other airplanes in the area, or closer to the airport, that appeared normal and could also serve as a good reference.)   So as this thing vanished into the horizon, we just brushed it off as some odd piece of space debris that had gotten caught in orbit or some loose ashes from a nearby bonfire (even though, in hindsight, I now realize that there was no smoke to be seen or smelled, and the night was absent of fire crackling, or people enjoying a fire)  As we were sitting together in the grass 5-10 minutes later, I spotted yet another object, identical to the other in every way (physical description, speed, height, size, etc.) coming across the sky from the same origin point in the West.   This time we studied the object with more scrutiny, as we had been intrigued by the irregularities of the previous.  ""Maybe we’re looking at the beginning of a meteor shower!"" I briefly thought, as sometimes you will see a couple before the majority appears.  But it was still a little odd, if it were that.   As we watched the thing float above our heads in its steady, silent path my boyfriend even suggested that the object was perhaps someone flying some sort of remote-controlled toy with a light.  I know better though, as my father (being pretty interested in aerial flight as a whole) has made and flown his own remote-controlled airplanes for decades, and our family has gone to a few RC clubs and flights.  By now, being halfway across the sky, this strange orb was fitting absolutely no description of anything I had ever recognized.  It was a completely ginger-hued orb that seemed to enclose some sort of flickering light, much like the flame on a candle.  It seems to be consistently traveling at a fairly low altitude, and had a straight, steady flight pattern.  We also both noticed that both objects had been entirely silent.  It also had no ""exterior"" or extra lights; it was simply an orange flickering sphere.  It did not have a tail, it did not accelerate or decelerate; it didn’t falter in its size, height, speed, or trajectory.   Suddenly during our examination, the object just shut off.  It didn’t fade out; nothing like that.  It just ""shut off"" like a switch.  This is when I started to get really interested.  No ashes, comets or stars, and certainly not aircraft!  An aircraft would just shut off like that so abruptly midair. My boyfriend and I looked at each other with confusion and curiosity.  ""We just saw our first UFO!""  He laughed jokingly, since he is well aware of the fact that I do not believe in UFO’s, like much of pop culture, with notions flying saucers and little green guys.  I believe, being the daughter of a devout Christian and Air Traffic Controller, in the term ""UFO"" in the strict definition of an ""unidentified flying object,"" and nothing more.   And, as a side note, even in 30+ years as an ATC for O’Hare International Airport in Chicago, my father has never had or seen a report of a UFO that they could not identify soon after its sighting.  But I digress.   Needless to say, I was completely dumbfounded by the objects we were seeing, and both my boyfriend and I were intrigued to say the least.  But what were the chances of seeing one, let alone two, strange things in the sky?  We laughed about it, and commented on how cool it was, but as our conversation continued it also swung back into normalcy. About 20 minutes later (probably about 10:50 pm, if I were to guess) a couple of clouds began to cover the sky, coming from the southwest.  With the stars disappearing and bugs beginning to nip at me more and more, I was thinking of beginning to head back home.   But before we could even stand to go, I saw something- again!  One of the SAME ""somethings,"" again.   I jumped up, mid-conversation, and franticly pointed out yet another airborne object to my boyfriend.  This time the orb seemed closer to the ground and/or bigger in size, and the flickering light was more defined.  Everything else, however, was eerily the same; spherical shape, silent, steady.   When reached the same air space with the clouds, it went right through them, absolutely undisturbed by them.   Just then, my boyfriend whipped out his cell phone, and tried to capture a picture, to no avail.  But I couldn’t move; my heart had stopped.  No flaming object, from inside or outside of earth’s orbit should be able to go through such a dense cloud without even a slight alteration in appearance or behavior.  But no, it flew right through the clouds as if a plane would.  (Though I knew it wasn’t one- and even planes can be affected by impacting clouds- turbulence, anyone?)   Also, the latest observation made me realize that this thing couldn’t be that far off.  If it’s cruising through a cloud-layer, this thing IS in our atmosphere so SHOULD not have such a stable, controlled path.   My heart began to pound.  When it was directly overhead (and well-clear of the clouds) it shut off abruptly.  It seemed to be lost or gone.  But when I spotted it a split-second later, I yelped and grabbed my boyfriend’s hand.  It appeared to be a completely black, saucer just hovering in the air.   It stood stationary for an instant, before ""bucking"" (much like a manual car switching gears at high speed) and then rapidly accelerating.  It had accelerated most definitely, but was still continuing on the same steady, unfaltering path, and never seemed to ascend or descend, similarly to the others.!   I don’t know where it went or what happened to it after that.  We were running home as fast as we could, the hairs on our body standing on end. After reaching the house out of breath, and hastily telling family members what we witnessed (mostly a skeptical audience, I think), my boyfriend went back to the same place to try and capture footage.  He was there for about a half hour, and was unfortunately unable to see or capture anything else. To the best of my knowledge, this was not any well-known aircraft, any comet, asteroid, or meteor, any ash from a fire...  It just was nothing I’ve ever seen.  I even looked online to see if there was any meteor, asteroid, etc. activity expected or spotted in the area for that time, and there was absolutely nothing.    So far, though, one of my neighbors has confirmed that she saw the activity as well, but then again I have heard nothing else from anyone else or read any news articles about the instance. And, yes, we were sober, and no I don’t (or didn’t, perhaps) even believe in ""extraterrestrial activity,"" so this is not wishful thinking, or an overactive imagination.  Even my boyfriend, who is fascinated with anything bizarre or scary, was terrified- and I have never seen him even remotely as scared in the 3 years we have been dating.",2011-06-12T00:00:00,41.937914953271026,-88.33166308411214

Transport troop carriers were parked on the taxi-way ready for drop on missile sites in Cuba. At 5:30 a.m., while waiting for relief on the taxi way, I noticed off in the distance over the Caribbean Sea an usual cloud, with flashing lights within it.  My canine flight and I watched and radioed each other to try to figure out what it was, because the trajectory of the cloud was headed towards the no fly zone.  The relief arrived, and we were picked up and driven across the active runway, still watching the object headed towards the parked B-52's alert area. When we arrived at the armory within the restricted area, the cloud was there.  It was drifting thirty feet above the ground, approximately 6 feet thick and 30 ft in diameter.  Dark swirls of clouds and lights swirled around the object.  The only thing that was visible were the lights spinning inside the dark swirling cloud like a carousel. Green, orange, yellow and blue.  Our entire alert crew came out of the mole hole to watch.  There were many mechanics, other flight crews and airmen observing as well.   The object passed us and headed towards the U2 hanger, which was strictly off limits.  My only concern was that nobody shot at whatever this object was.  We all had our firearms, standing there watching it until it disappeared. After the incident I went off duty for 3 days leave.  Nobody told me not to talk about it.

While smoking, I looked up into the night sky.  The clouds parted and I saw two objects in the sky.  The  first was  a huge object with lots of widows with green lights coming out of the windows.  The lights were blinking on and off as if it was a code.   The second object was the same shape as the first, only smaller.  It also had blinking green lights.  To me it looked like they were communicating to each other. I felt happy and excited that I was witnessing this event.  I did not think I was seen or that these objects knew anyone was watching.  I did not speak of this event to anyone. Recently I went to my doctor for sinus problems.  He ordered an x-ray.  X-ray showed a ""screw"" shaped  item in the top of my head.  I have never had surgery on any kind on my head.  My doctor sent me to see a surgeon.  Surgeon stated he could not remove this item because the procedure would be to painful and he would not do it.

I walked outside to check out a thunderstorm that was brewing near my house, I thought that maybe it was going to become severe like one thunderstorm that came by a few days ago.  When I looked at the edge of the thundercloud, I saw a completely black object at least 20,000 ft. up in the atmosphere. The object was so high up that I couldn't make out any details, only could I make out very general details.  The object moved slowly and smoothly and no engine sound was emitted, of course it was so high up. Although the object was to small to be an airliner, and it was way of course the usual plane route. My house happens to be under a MAJOR plane route and every single day at least 150 planes fly above my house, so I'm quite familiar with planes because I see them so often. I strongly believe that the object WASN'T a bird, because I really doubt they fly so high up, we do have a lot of birds in Puerto Rico anyways! Well before I could get someone to see it for th! emselves or a camera at least, the object dissappeared behind a cloud. What interests me is that the flying object was flying over a highly restricted air zone, here in Ft. Buchanan, only military helicopters and commercial airliners are allowed to fly over the base.  I'd really like that government officials have a better eye out on the sky around here, who knows if the object was a threat?  If it was human, it could have dropped a bomb, don't you agree?  But I highly doubt it was human anyway, it was moving in a way so smooth, that no other plane I've seen has ever flown so gracefully.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,,

I have worked in aviation for over 20 years and have seen a lot of aircraft so I asked them if they wanted to see something interesting. As we walked outside we noticed two more behind these, then two more seemingly flying in pairs but fairly evenly spaced overall. The moon was partially obscured in the western sky but there were few clouds and the winds were calm. The string of lights were yellowish-orange in colour, somewhat like the sodium street lamps in our neighbourhood. They were slowly pulsing and as they travelled at what would appear to be aircraft takeoff and climb speeds (200-300 knots), they turned to a more northerly course and faded out. There were no visible beacons or other lights on the objects (what caught my attention in the first place).  I ran inside to get my phone to see if it could record the event on video, but the quality was too poor to detect the lights and only recorded our commentary. As I came back outside we watched in amazement as the count increased to eight, then ten and finally twelve with about six visible at any one time (the others had turned north and faded out in sequence).  We noticed that they appeared to be climbing from the Georgetown area to the west and did not all follow the exact same course, some turning north before others did.  I observed one passing behind a cloud and then emerging again just before fading out completely and none of them ever stopped pulsing, they just appeared to dim as they got farther away.  I thought they must be helicopters to have maintained their formation so I asked my daughter to run in and shut off the air conditioning but there was no detectable sound so they may have been too far away. I could see no other aircraft in the immediate airspace, but saw one to the south heading north (presumably from Pearson International Airport) that may have observed them.  After the last light faded away, an aircraft flew overhead with the familiar beacons of a passenger jet and it was obvious to all of us that these lights in the sky appeared to be something different.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,43.87004782608696,-79.90456521739131

On L.I., I would watch the stars as I smoked my cigarettes, which I never do in the house. Since moving down to Cary, it was upsetting to me that the sky had all this light pollution reflecting from the ground & the stars weren't as clear as in  L.I., N.Y., nevertheless, I would look at the sky when I would step out of the house to smoke my occasional cigarette.  I am used to seeing planes, jets & helicopters & have many years of orientation of what they look like at night. On 3-07-11 I stepped out for my cigarette break, looked up & saw this large star which I thought was a planet.  A passenger jet was flying west from Raleigh airport in the east.  As I'm watching the jet, I noticed that the star was moving above the jet from south to north.  If the jet was flying at 2,000 feet, I re-evaluated that the star was an object flying above the jet around 3,000 feet. The object was round, very bright white.  From looking at a typical star, the object was at least 20 to 30 times larger.  There was no beacon, no typical red & green lights.  I thought it may be a plane's head lights, but the headlights were pointing down & the plane must be flying backwards???  As I continued looking at it, it seemed to be flying higher then it slowly vanished.  I was and still am convinced that that was nothing I have ever seen a man-made aircraft do.

Mentally and physically stable and retired.   On March 7, 2011 at @ 9:05 p.m. I was proceeding in a WESTERLY direction on TIETON DR.  I got to 60th AVE and turned right.  After making my turn, about ½ block, I stopped my car and called my wife who works 1 block away, on 60th Ave.  The evening sky was clear and the stars were clearly visable. As I looked up in a SOUTH-WESTERLY direction I saw some amber lights coming in my  direction. There were 9 Circular Amber Lights coming towards me.   At first sight they were coming at a sloping down-ward direction in a uniformed manner.  There was one at the front and 4 rows of two in each row.  They were moving in a SOUTH-EASTERN DIRECTION toward Ahatanum Ridge and toward the lower Yakima Valley.  They seem to be on a landing position in a down-ward direction, as if a plane was about to land at our airport.  It was just in front of me when they leveled out and all began to fly, in unison, straight towards Ahtanum Ridge.  The one thing I took note of was the fact that I could hear NO sound.  I have heard a lot of Jets fly over and a lot of helicopters, since we are so close to the Yakima Pomona Military Firing Center.  I did not hear the roar of jets or the rotor sound of a helicopter.  It was silent with no noise before, during or after seeing them. The end object (looking at the formation to the right rear of my sight) veered off slightly and came in my direction. It veered off for no more than to the count of 5 when it resumed its position of the formation.  The formation then continued straight toward Ahtanum Ridge.  As it got past the ridge the formation, in unison, began to move in an upward direction and in a matter of seconds they, one by one, began to disappear.  They all maintained speed and direction in unison.   I was trying to approximate their size and distance and thought them to be over the lower valley  before they disappeared from my sight.  I held my fist up to them, as they were in front of me at the initial sighting.   With my arm extended and  my fist in a ball they all disappeared, as they did with each appendage.  As I put up the small pinky finger it barely covered the front object allowing me to see the rest of the formation, a trick I learned in the Army. I contacted my wife, by cell, and she saw the whole scenario. I tried to get my new cell phone activated to shoot a picture or movie but was unable to do so before it disappeared. I got into my car and it was about 09:15  ((sic.  21:15 hrs.)). I called 911 and they said there were no other reported sightings called in and they advised me to call the UFO CENTER. I called the local paper, the Yakima Herald Republic, and was told that there were no other reports, like mine, and that they found it ""Not News Worthy.""

Object observed was at first thought to be the North Star. The star began moving slowly towards the south east.  As the object moved closer its color was more defined and observed as a large flouresant green light with a light colored haze shadow above the green light.  Object at this time was estimated at least 100,000 feet above the earth.  The object lowered more than X5 in size and hovered slightly north east of our location. At this time my wife and I could see there was some type of ""object"" light gray in color like a shadow that was shaped like a triangle above the green light.  This triangle object was directly over the top of the green light ( same color green as that of a green light used in green for traffic signals) and moved as if it was part of the structure attached to the Object. The Object hovered for approximately four minutes at this position.  The Object then began to lower elevation and proceed directly towards our residence.  At first as the Object was lowering it was hard to tell if the Object was a Craft or some type of balloon because the green light was well below the gray fuzzy Object.  I say fuzzy because the Objects perimiter lines were not clearly defined until the object lowered to approximately 30,000 ft.  The Object which I will now call a Craft continued to lower at an angle in which we could only see the bottom of the Craft and the lower green light which was well beneath the craft.  The Craft slowly came down directly at us taking about three minutes then made some sort of a maneuver at approximately 10,000-15,000 feet tipping forward the ""body structure of the Craft"" and turning towards the westerly direction (San Francisco and Oakland) and stopped. At this time the craft approximately one third mile away and was seen to have a series! of window like structures with clearly defined pilliars.  These solid same as Craft composition pilliars made this front of Craft area look like it had windows only in front and not all around the Craft.  Also, it was hard to tell if this green area was not some type of power source and not windows at all BUT they sure looked like windows to us...  These structures were clearly defined as they were flourescent green in color same as the single green light below the Craft. This Object/Craft only had the solid permanent ""on"" round green light as described above and no type of the required red, green or white flashing navigation type airplane lights. The Craft straighten up again and stopped. The Craft positioned itself so we could only see the bottom again for about 30 seconds.  I tried to take three photos of the Craft and the green light with my camera but the Pic's even though they were in the view area when Pic was taken did not show up on photo.  The Object/Craft was now close enough to see that it appeared to be emitting enough light from the large lower green light to illuminate the bottom of the craft and make it visible to the eye.  The Craft appeared as a semi-flat gray colored triangle shaped object. At ALL times during the observation of the Object/Craft.  There was NO SOUND at all from the Craft and there was some type of energy either emitting from or surrounding the Craft.  This energy would slightly distort the Crafts perimiter lines.  I can only describe this energy or what I am calling energy as someting that would look like heat waves in the desert on a very hot summer day. The Craft after hovering another 30 seconds began to slowly move forward and descend in altitude moving to the west on the approximate approach path in between Oakland International and SFO Airports.  The Craft at this time was approximately 5,000 feet lowering to 2,000 feet and about one quarter mile from our location.  The Craft appeared to be about twice the size of a 747 aircraft. As the Craft slowly moved off in the distance.  One could see as the Craft moved through some thin low clouds (that added more additional light reflecting from the city lights)that the Craft clearly had less distortion from the energy waves.  The extra light gave us a glimps that the Craft's surface was non reflective flat gray to egg shell gray in color and had slighly rounded corners in the triangluar shape. Now at a lower altitude and closer proximity it was much clearer to see the craft. We could see that the green light that emitted light was well below the craft and at least approximately 300! feet lower than the Craft.  At this point, I could not tell if the green light illuminated the bottom of the Craft or the Craft actually had a faint green glow emitting from the Craft. This was because no attaching structure could be visibally seen inbetween the Craft and the lower green light at any time..Especially when the Craft passed through the lighted clouds and became more visible and we could not see any ataching structure to the green light.   The lower green light appeared solid in color, round and seemed have been shaped like a sphere.  The overall size of this green light was approximately 5 percent the size of the Craft. This Craft was stealthy quiet. If we would not have been in our spa watching for satillites we never would have seen this Craft and Event. We watched this Craft slowly move towards San Francisco/Oakland at an estimated 100 mph same as a small private plane's speed almost stop then proceed and continue at an altitude of approximatel 1000 feet until it was out of view.  The Craft proceededThis heading over San Francisco Bay like it was going to pass right in between the two major airports SFO and OAK.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,37.54118127183787,-121.976828371768

The time was approximately 21:40 central time zone on the 20th of May, 2011.  The sky had already been night for over an hour.   The object was traveling from the south and heading due north.  There was no clear shape to the object and it was emitting a brilliant green light.  The best way I can describe it was a small green ball of light that changed several different levels of intensity from very bright to dim, then back to bright, then dim, and back to bright and then complete darkness.   There was also what looked to be a green cloud around the object.  I am not sure if the light was producing the cloud or if it was just traveling through water vapor in the atmosphere.   The object maintained a steady altitude and my best guess would be that it was one and one half miles away and traveling at approximately 600-700mph.  The object did not produce a sound that could be heard from my vantage point.  It was only visible for probably four seconds before going completely dark, which is a fairly decent amount of time to observe it.   I know that it was not a meteor because the way it was changing to several different levels of intensity from bright to dim and back to bright. It was also maintaining a steady smooth altitude and going much slower than a meteor.   There were faint clouds in that section of the sky obstructing the view of the stars.   I am not sure how far away or high the clouds were.  It was not navigation or strobe lights from an aircraft.  I have spent half my life dealing with aviation and have seen thousands of aircraft in flight in daylight and in darkness.  I have certainly seen over one hundred meteors in my life and this was much different.  I have seen green meteorites illuminate and then burn out. This was much different and slower and maintained a steady altitude.   The way the light changed intensity to several different levels was very interesting.  This concludes what!

At approximately 10:30 PM, I was reading a novel and drinking some coffee when I felt a strange wave-like movement under my feet.  At first, living in California, I thought I was having vertigo so I stood up and walked around a bit to get the blood flowing, but I still felt the distant rumbling.   At that point I realized that it might be an earthquake.  I've been through the Northridge quake and quite a few others, but it didn't seem too serious so I went back to reading, but after about another 45 seconds it intensified to the point where objects were tipping/moving/falling etc., and typical earthquake events such as car alarms going off and my electricity shutting off.   The shaking was accompanied by what could be described as a military jet flying over very low at subsonic speeds.  This is also a common occurrence due to the numerous air bases in Southern California (Edwards, March Air Base et al.).  At this point I was terrified and so I went outside as I was on! a second story of a building and fearful that it may collapse beneath me (Which would make the first floor even less safe) and when I emerged from the building I could notice quite a few trees shaking on my property as in a strong gust.   I walked up the road a ways (I live in a semi-rural area albeit somewhat close to the city) to my neighbor's house to see if he was okay since he had just began rebuilding his outdoor second story patio and only half of the wood beams had been installed so far.  He was also standing out in the road and he yelled to me as I approached and was pointing at me, but I couldn't hear him over the 'jet noise'.  As I got closer, however, I could make out that he was saying ""Look."" and pointing not at me, but behind me. It was at that point that I turned around and saw what I believe to be a single craft.  The reason I say it was a craft was that it was moving slowly about 300-500 feet off of the ground and the noise was relative to it spatially, i.e. as it passed over the road, moving perpendicular to our view of it, the noise followed it.  It was shaped like two contact lenses attached to one another with the side that would be placed on the eye as the welding point, or what ever.  For the brief time I saw it (about 15 seconds) it appeared to me to have similar mass to about one city block.  There was a multi-colored light on the top and the bottom and two white lights on either side of it.  It moved to where it was obscured from our view by two oak trees so both me and my friend pursued it. When we were underneath the trees we heard the jet sound disappear in what I can only describe as a 'sucking' transition to silence.  It went from very high volume and intensity to an anti-crescendo and by the time we emerged on the other side of the two oaks it had disappeared from sight.",2011-05-29T00:00:00,34.168753811659194,-118.61083318385651

Along the ""bench"" or base of the mountains there are power lines connected to towers strung out across the mountain from north to south for miles in each direction.  On this bench I saw a pillar of light as if a power line tower was suddenly aflame although the light was white-yellow and not orange like a fire.  Other lights flashed close to this pillar, possibly emergency vehicles for these lights were much fainter than the original light and in whites and reds and they moved like cars would. In seconds, the pillar of light seemed to pop and then all the power went out. I immediately called the police.  The 911 dispatcher told me that ""they are taking care of it.""  The power stayed out for 2 hours.   I heard a helicopter about 15 minutes later. The next morning I posted a comment on Facebook.  Several of my friends responded.  One said, ""OK so strange!  I totally saw a flash of light then we lost power.  And one of our satelite recievers will not work. Hmmmm""   Another said, ""I was up watching tv when the power went out.. It was weird that it took so long to come back on.  Usually it comes back on in 1 hr... But no I didn't see the light!"" ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she seemed to us to be unusually eloquent and objective in her description of the facts surrounding the incident.

The trees are about 1/8th of a mile down the road, and about 40 feet or more tall, big pine trees.  looking at it holding out my arm with a ruler in my hand, like a painter comparing sizes, the object from the trees would appear 5 inches beyond the rulers length.

I want to remain logical on this, and the possiblity that it is something man made, but for the moment given the time, distance, clearity of the object in an unclear sky, and weather, no one that saw it could identify what it is, so by nature it is undentified and in the sky.",2011-03-10T00:00:00,41.9072,-72.4728

We returned back to my parent’s house after a birthday dinner party just after 8pm. My father stepped out on the rear patio to have a smoke break. Shortly after, he hollered for my husband and brother to come quick and look at this. He exclaimed, “What the hell is that?”  This peaked our interest. These objects appeared to be burning or on fire and made absolutely no noise, no prop wash, no piston engine sound, and no jet wash, no recognizable navigational red and green lights.  They appear to be on some sort of flight path following interstate I-4 West coming out of Tampa’s Gulf area heading east. These objects could clearly be seen breaking the Western Horizon but never met the Eastern Horizon. They seem to head upward & fade out and away. The first sighting was of a cluster of 3, in a triangular formation; once the last of the 3 faded away, 2 more broke the horizon evenly spaced out, then accompanied by 1 more, totaling 4 in a straight line, fading into outer space, followed by another series of 4.  Following the same flight path and pattern. When viewed with Binoculars the objects were in the shape of seashells with the bottom illuminated. They had constant luminosity and appeared to be at a uniform altitude and heading. They all seem to gain altitude at the same location as they advance skyward out of sight. In conclusion, after contacting the sheriff’s office and local news channels only ONE other call was made about this phenomenon. Several reporters were sent images and video but none have responded to date.  Several remarks were made to sort of “lighten” the situation by such individuals.  We also called several family members and friends  that would’ve been in the flight path; however none were able to see these objects, but they should’ve been able to.

I decided to take a couple of pictures of the water and the surrounding area with my digital camera.  We were driving in a convertible with both the top and windows down.  I didn't see anything out of the ordinary, until I downloaded the pictures and saw what looks like a small dark circle type disc in the background of the picture.  I had shown my husband the pictures as well, and he said that the first picture may be due to sun exposure, but, that in the second picture, the object had a slightly different shape to it.

Then I've noticed two similar objects but they were bright white light instead of read one.  They were moving the same direction at similar speed.  There is no airport in the area and they seemed to be quite low over the ground (however quite far away).  They couldn't be passenger airplines. I thought that maybe they are small, private airplanes and I would stick to that theory, but then s! uddenly the started to move in the opposite direction and then stopped moving and started hoovering in the same place.

My girlfriend and I were taking our dogs out to use the bathroom when we noticed a couple of strange things in the sky. There were 2 medium sized bright white lights sitting in low points in the sky, multiple (at least 4) very small red flashing lights that would fly around those points (one shooting straight up into the sky very fast, one circled around one of those points, one shot to the right and we could not see it anymore, and the other one randomly flying beside the points)  There was one considerably bigger bright light that would flash from white to red to blue. That one was in the shape of a V, the others were too small to tell but if I had to guess I would say they were circular. The V shaped object would orbit and would sit in this one point in the sky while randomly moving either side to side or up and down. It would be still, then move side to side, then be still, then move again, and so on and so forth.  We sat and watched this for a little over an hour until going inside. There were stars out, however those were definitely not stars considering they moved. We are unsure if perhaps they are some sort of low flying government sattelites or possibly UFO's.  Definitely going to check again tonight and will report again if we see anything, we also took a 3 minute video of it. The weird part is that in the video it seems farther than it was when we were looking at it and the colors seem more apparent.

The lights were now far in the distance, but we were able to track its movement for at least 5 minutes from when we first noticed it until a house got in our way.

We are wondering if anyone else reported this. We were traveling on West 694 about 2 miles out from the 94 interchange when we spotted a large round object over Maple Grove.  It looked to be the area of Rush Creek golf course.  At first I thought it to be a Hot Air Balloon but the closer we got the farther west it moved at incredible speed. (This when things got bizarre)  We turned onto the 94 exit and then instantly turned off onto the Weaver Lake Rd Exit and came up to a red light. While waiting along with a number of other vehicles we could see the large round object (with no distinct features) had turned and traveled back east about 5 to 10 miles in less than a minute and was hovering over Boston Scientific complex, about a ¼ mile to a ½ mile WNW clearly in view. We were watching this in amazement when out of nowhere (right in fron! t of us) a large Black unmarked Military style helicopter shows up and approaches the object. Right as this is happening we got the green and turned left onto Weaver Lake Rd. We made the left turn and noticed the Helicopter had veered off to the right of the object. Thinking as soon as we get to the top of the hill (not even a ¼ of a mile) the object is going to be right there in front of us. The object had completely vanished. We traveled about a ¼ of a mile down the road and could see it had traveled west about 5 miles in less than a minute. My next thought was it seemed to be over Rush Creek Elementary. I drove up to the school and had a great view for a long ways west. We saw the object but it had traveled as far west as we could see about another 5-10 miles. I proceeded to drive north on 101 until I got to County Rd 30 and took a left. And it just may be coincidence, but right after we made the turn there was a trooper sitting off the side of the road. We did see the o! bject again, but it was so far away there was no way we were g! oing to get close to it. A few facts here; No Hot air Balloon is going to travel 5-10 miles west and turn around and return east the same distance if not more in the matter of a minute or less. There were a lot of people that saw this. Anyone traveling on west 694 at this time of day saw this. Hot air balloons can’t travel distances this thing did. This thing could travel 5 to 10 miles in less than a minute. I called the police department at 7:30 to see if anyone reported anything on this but the dispatcher said she just started working at 5:00 and had not heard anything. This report was also filed with MUFON on the day it happened. We are meeting with an MUFON investigator on Saturday morning to try and recreate everything we saw.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,45.125105263157884,-93.47469157894737

While driving home from work, from Bloomington to Indianapolis, I noticed 5 to 6 individual amber colored lights in formation.  As they passed my car, the formation was maintained, but it wasn't a formation that is consistent to the military as it was very lose and not in line. The route I take from work is State Route 37 (northbound).  Normally on my return trip home there are aircraft on the left (west) side of the road flying the approach pattern into the Indianapolis International Airport (KIND).  As a private pilot, I am very aware of the orientation of the lights on aircraft.  This was unlike anything I have ever seen. Before the sighting, I noticed what appeared to be a shooting star going to the right, or east side, of the road.  Whether this has any connection to the sighting or not is unclear.  After driving for about 2-4 minutes I noticed the lights through the trees on the same side of the road as the shooting star.   Thinking that it look rather odd, I continued looking in the direction until I passed by a field where there was a clearing in the trees. I was about 10-15 miles from the city at this time. At that point, I could clearly see that there were 5-6 amber colored lights, almost in a Z formation.  I tried to take a picture with my cell phone camera but the lights were too faint to show up.  They appeared to be traveling southbound and I could not tell at what altitude, as there was no prospective on what I was seeing.   As they passed to the right of me, each light faded from the first to last and I couldn't see them anymore.  As I was looking, I noticed there was a cloud that was illuminated by the moon so i kept watch until I spotted them again.  They were no longer emitting any light, but I could see specks in contrast to the illuminated cloud.  They were not connected in any way, and were independant of each other. After realizing what i had seen, and the close relationship with landing aircraft, I did contact the TSA office at KIND.

I pulled off to the side of the onramp (where the Metro buses load) to observe and film with my IPhone.  These were not recognizable as aircraft since each craft (i.e. light) was spaced much too closely together.  Their elevation was lower than what aircraft normally fly at and they were at various altitudes.   There were not any strobes (white, green, or red) that would indicate these were valid aircraft; these lights were of a pinkish-orange color.  All were the same color and brightness. As the lights traveled south until the what appeared to be the southern end of Mercer Island and then elevated up to the clouds and could not be seen thereafter. After about 7 of these passed us, an 8th followed them at extremely high speed and also elevated into the clouds. Curious to see more, I exited the freeway at Coal Creek Parkway and drove to the top of Somerset (neighborhood).  From the top of Somerset, I could see aircraft approaching SeaTac Intl. Airport, which is much further away than Mercer Island.   The aircraft approaching SeaTac had visible strobes - so the lights that I saw, which were much closer than SeaTac, clearly were not typical aircraft as no strobes were present.

As I began observing it thoroughly, I noticed its tail had very bright white and red lights going off.  The red light was going off at one second intervals with the white in between.   I assumed it was a government aircraft like Air Force One because the tail  lights were very powerful.  The second thing I noticed was that this mysterious aircraft did not have lights on the wings.

The aircraft flew in on a 90 degree angle which I thought was weird because I thought all commercial aircrafts could only fly at a 45 degree angle or at a certain angle; while this aircraft was flying in a horizontal line.   The aircraft flew, from what I could measure with my arms, in a 40 degree angle in 10 seconds.  It flew through the lowest cloud formation I could see and the lights were so powerful I could still see it throught the cloud formation.  Seconds after the aircraft disappeared I saw a reflection in a window of a bright red light on the opposite building in front of me; as if to say the light was comimng from behind my building.  As I looked behind my building I saw nothing.  I still heard the aircraft about 3 seconds after it disappeared from my sight.  I went back into the building.  About 10 min later I stepped outside and called the National UFO Reporting Hotline and realized the sky was completely clear.

It was probably about 150 feet away from me, and only about 200 feet in the air (it was not significantly higher than the treeline).  By my best guess, the craft was maybe 100 feet in diameter.  This was not just a case of a small orb in the sky - it was right there in front of me. There were a large quantity of bright blue lights on the underside, and on the vertical surface were many bright white lights.  There were also blue lights that lined the top perimeter of the craft.  There were also red lights that seemed to be randomly placed around the craft as well.  All three of the different colored lights were blinking at random intervals (individual lights were all blinking randomly). The craft hovered above the tree line for about 1 minute, and I could hear a very faint pulsating noise.  There was no wind effect that could be noticed on the trees, etc.  It then started to move North very slowly, at the same elevation, and eventually passed aross the Illinois & Michigan Canal.  I watched it move North until I could no longer see it (it eventually got far enough to where it fell below the horizon line).

Then someone said they were night time parachuters or parasailers - but they wouldn't do that at night unless it was military and we did not hear any motor or engine sound nothing.  And it definitely was not a plane or helicopter or fireworks.  We all came to the conclusion that they had to be a UFO. They sailed silently across the sky lit with red and orange lights seemingly going faster and higher as they head further west.  Once they lined up perfectly 3 across but that could have been due to the angle we were looking at, then the one to the left faded.   I think it got concealed above the clouds.  Then the one to the right disappeared a few seconds later, then the center one just got further and further away seemingly going faster heading west still lit until it faded assuming due to range.  The center one did not fade into the clouds or over the horizon, it just faded into a clear patch of sky while heading west.

As I got to the sliding back glass, I pulled the curtains to the side just a little so that I could look into my back yard.  Since the beginning of October of 2010, I've been feeding the deer (white tail) that come into the back yard at night.  As I pulled the curtains slightly to the right, I saw a bright white light falling from the sky as if it was a shooting star.  So, I then called out to my fiance for her to come quick and have a look.  As she ran up to the sliding back glass next to me we saw the light continue to fall. Then it  all of a sudden come to a complete stop right above the tops of the trees while it remained illuminated.   In amazement and awe we both realized that this was no shooting star.  In fact this light was much brighter than any star in the sky.  As it stopped from free falling it wa! s hovering.  The light would go to the right then it would hover to the left.  We decided to go outside to have a better look.  While outside we were looking at this light through binoculars in disbelief of what we were seeing.   For one, a shooting star will not stop as it is in flight through the earths atmosphere and two, the light emitted from the shooting star will eventually disappear. Staring out into the back yard, the white light had stopped right above the tree line that stands out about 40 yards behind our mobile home.  What happened next is what really through my mind for a loop.  About 5 minutes after spotting the UFO, an actual shooting star had came into my vision from the left and was going right.  The shooting star was going just as fast as the white light was.  I knew that it couldn't be an airplane because an airplane has to keep moving through the air to keep flying.  Also, I knew that it couldn't be a helicopter because of how fast that ! it was going when I first saw it.  Then, after watching the wh! ite ligh t for about another 5 to 10 minutes, I knew that I was watching a UFO ( Unidentified Flying Object).  What really had made my mind up in saying that this was a UFO is that it had no blinking aviation lights on it what so ever.  So as time passed, my fiance and I where speechless as to what we were witnessing.  As time progressed, the UFO moved from the top of the tree line to almost straight up in the air from where we were looking.  As the sun came started to come up, I then moved outside for the remainder of the time that I watched this flying object.  The white light had now become dimmer due to the light in the sky.  I then braced myself against a pole outside and held the binoculars up to have a real good steady look.  From what I saw, it was a metal object that was again, no airplane nor helicopter.",2011-01-31T00:00:00,30.19300476190476,-91.31982380952381

While I was cleaning off the car I saw two balls of light in the distance floating from the South East towards the North West direction. My initial thought was the local military college doing some type of night training with their helicopter, but as they neared there was no sound. Then their formation changed, the one in the lead stopped and the one in the back circled around to the front. At this point I could see they appeared more as giant balls of flame and not a light emitted from a bulb or another like source. They continued one slowly with a slowly side to side swaying and then the one in the lead stopped and the one in the back circled around to the front, so now they are in the original formation. They backed up slightly. I yelled to my wife for her to some see what I was observing. She came out and observed the balls of fire.  It was at this time we noticed another coming from the original direction. When my wife went inside to grab the camera I looked back at the first two, they had started to ""burn out"" like two large candles losing the last of their burn, I watched them completely fade and then turned my attention back to the third object.

The third object had burned out so we watched the fourth she had exclaimed that there was another rising up. I was able to observe the trajectory the object, it rose at an angle greater then 45 degrees, more like 50-60 and seemed to plateau out at a certain altitude and continue on in the same direction as the others. Each ball headed in the same direction North-west but took different paths there, we watched the leading object burn out and another rise up shortly after. We were quickly up to the sixth object, the fourth had burned out and the fifth was almost burnt out. My wife had got the camera to the video setting and started to record.  I got on the phone and called my sister (she lives in the same town) I got her to go outside and she too observed the lights. When my wife and I saw the seventh rise up my sister verified she saw it rise up too. Again each object took its own unique path and was changing direction, stopping, slowing down, speeding up all without making a noise. I told my sister to get her husband and try to get him to see them too! When i got off the phone with her i called my father (lives a few towns over) and tried to see if he could see them, by this time we where onto our ninth object on the rise. My wife stopped filming we have about 3 minutes of video. The ninth one moved much slower and had taken a drastically different path, it headed more towards our house (West By North-West) it lowered slightly. We could really make out what appeared to be the flame much better. My wife was slightly panicked by the ninth object and its almost curious nature about us. Looking at the time on my phone i realized we need to go get our dinner (they close at 9 on the dot and it was quickly closing in on that time) I continued the conversation with my father (he was unable to see them) while we pulled out of our driveway, we watched the eighth object start to burn out and the ninth change its path back to a North-West one like the others. While on the way into town we saw the 10th one rise up and start on the North-West path of the others. We grabbed our dinner as quickly as we could, upon returning home the event had stopped.

This event happened when I was a child, so I am unsure of the exact year or more specifically the exact date and time.  My best guess is the late 70s. My then sister-in-law (She is no longer my sister-in-law and unfortunely have lost contact with her.) and I was coming out of her apartment which was a two family house at the end of a dead end road in Meriden to go to the car.  It was just around 8 p.m.. I am unsure as to were we were going but I think she was giving me a ride back to my house in Southington. We walked down a set of steep steps going down to the car (at that time, noticed nothing in the sky even being up at a higher level).  By the time we got down to the road at the car, we started seeing some very large object in the sky which was moving very slowly and seemed to just appear from a set of trees to the right.  As I said, I was a child at the time so details are sketchy.  What I do remember is it was very large 200-300 feet, it was oval in shaped, many lights around the edges and I believe the object was a dark gun metal color. Me and my sister-in-law were pretty scared at the time.  The object just appeared to be hovering or stopped.  Then ever so slowly it would move.  We got in the car and started to drive down the road.  As we were driving down the road, we saw someone walking on the side of the road.  My sister-in-law stopped and said to this guy who was probably about in his 30s ""Do you see what we are seeing?"".  I remember he said 'Yea, What is that?"".  My sister-in-law said 'We don't know but we are going to follow it"". We continued down the road keeping the object within our vision at all times.  We got on the 691 highway heading towards Southington as that appeared where it was heading.  The object picked up some speed but was still flying low.  When we were on the highway, we saw a bunch of cars slow down and put their brake lights on as I am sure they were just as curious to what this was.  It was getting a little more difficult to follow it once on the highway because the object did pick up speed. As we went by high cliffs (that were near Hubbard Park) that were on the right side of the highway we lost track of the object.  After we got past the cliffs, we looked in the sky to see where it was and it was gone. As I said, unfortunetly, I am not in contact with my now ex-sister in law anymore as she would probably remember more details of the event then me because she was mouch older. Even years after this happened, I remember her saying to me....'Do you remember that night we saw that thing in the sky?"".  Since then, I've always been curious as to if any other reports came out around this time and saw the same thing as we did.

My wife and one year old daughter were with me at the time.  As we approached the harbor drive, I noticed a large silver ship hovering above the trees.  We stopped and watched if for a few moments until it followed the tree line down to the Harbor and headed off across Puget Sound towards Mt. Rainier.  This was the subject of a regression done in Kennewick, WA. in 2009.   These were red/browns that pulled us into the craft.  They stated that they were in the neighborhood and just stopped by to say hello. They expressed pleasure at the fact that I had settled down and started a family.  Amazing.  There were two in sight.  The smaller one that held me as a child and a larger entity that was more fully developed and seemed to be in charge.  They also stated that there was something out there in our future coming our way.  This was the first sighting that I remembered and when I underwent regression, the hypnotist instructed me to go to the first sighting that I have ever had.  That abduction occurred when I was eleven years old while living in Westmont, N.J.   I was being shadowed by a Silvery craft while walking in a park near where we lived.  It was silvery with brassy portholes and about 25 feet in diameter.  It was hovering over the trees.  I suddenly felt myself being sucked up a hose type device and landing near a wall/shelf in a corner of the craft.  Something was off to my left rear.  I was afraid and turned my head down and away.  It took my left wrist in its hand and attempted to see into my face.  It was a red/brown entity that was about an inch taller than me.  It was very nurturing and concerned that I had been interfered with.  I have never felt threatened by these entities.  Angry, yes, but not threatening.

My children were in the bed room behind me.  The object was brassy in color with flat ends, although shaped somewhat like a football.  I reached behind me for the .357 magnum that was in the headboard.  The weapon was hot loaded and had a trigger safety.  Something was about to get used for target practice. I awoke in an upright position at about 4:45 AM.  It was light out.  I went into the kitchen and made myself a cup of coffee and sat down on the base of the fireplace when I noticed oily spots on my feet.

It was late in the evening in December 1986, when I walked out of my house to have a cigarette.  Two family members went with me.   As we stood talking, a very huge object became noticeable in the sky passing over our house.  It appeared to be very low in the sky, but was difficult to actually tell just how high.  The shape was odd because it looked like a rectangular building on its side with red points of light at each intersection. Must have been around 8 -10 points of light.  The strangest thing was that it seemed transparent.  We could see the sky through it even though it was a mass of some kind that we could tell was moving through the sky. The object made absolutely no sound and was moving what seemed to be very slowly, almost as if it was floating.  As I said, it was huge.  It was not a formation.  We could actually see an outline of the object as it moved. As it was very close to Christmas, it never even crossed my mind when I went in to report this strange object to the local Sheriff’s Dept., that they might think I was perpetrating a hoax.  When the Sheriff’s Department came on the line and I proceeded to ask if anyone had reported an object going over the town, I suddenly realized that they may think I am pulling a prank relating to Santa Claus.  I was a little embarrassed, but they said no one else had reported this.  In later years I also reported it on, I believe, MUFON, when it was not required that you pay a membership. Almost twenty years later, a security guard and one of my family members, who had witnessed this event,  were talking and the security guard related a sighting he had at the same time and the same description (before this family member ever said anything to him).

I'd rather see a hockey game than attend a New Age lecture, and believe mine is the kind of personality that would correlate negatively with any variety of crankiness (even if I haven't done a statistical regression analysis on this). Basically, I don't, in a general sense, believe in paranormal events, or UFOs, or anything of the sort. Nevertheless, I had an experience I'm at a loss to interpret within a scientific mindset. I still make a small allowance for the possibility that my story might be explained by either the Finnish (not likely) or the Russian military (just conceivable). My wife and I live in the seaside community of Vuosaari in Helsinki, Finland. Last winter, on the 21st of January, 2010, at about 23:15 (GMT+2), we were out walking our dog when the following occurred:  - First, at a distance of about 750-1000 m out on the bay (Aurinkolahti), in the direction of Musta Hevonen island, a luminous object suddenly appeared over the horizon. Its shape was that of a parallelepiped, comprising two rhombic and four rectangular surfaces. It shone emerald-green, though with a darker turquoise hue around the edges. This first object was some 40 meters wide across its front face and was stationary for about 30 seconds, hovering at a height of 25-40 m. From this object ""emerged"" a number of smaller, shining objects in the shape of cones. These were initially bright yellow but quickly shifted to orange, then to a brilliant white, then bright yellow again. The cones were about 5 m tall and about 1,5-2 m in diameter at the base. They, too, were 25-40 m above the sea, but were moving around rapidly, and the color cycling occurred at a rate of tenths of seconds. We saw them go through about 20-30 such cycles (10 secs). These smaller objects then merged back into the larger one. While this was happening the aggregate object showed several different hues. After this the object simply disappeared, although my wife spotted a dark, semi-transparent cloud next to the original location (dark enough to stand out against the night sky), drifting ENE towards Pikku Niinisaari isle. Finally, we saw another luminous object in the shape of a cone some 40 m tall, hovering at a height of about 20 m over the Uutela promonitory at the bay inlet. It was orange in color, but had other bright hues around the circular base edge. This object was visible for up to 40 seconds. Eventually it vanished completely, while still above the headland. We stayed to watch the sea for another half-hour, but there was nothing more to be seen. I reported the incident to the Coast Guard, where it was duly recorded. Friends have suggested it might have been some kind of military drill by the garrison stationed out on Isosaari island, involving signal flares and a weather balloon. I hardly think so, for several reasons. No such drill appears to have been in progress at the time, a balloon, to my knowledge, cannot behave as described, etc. Another possible explanation, at least in theory, would be ball lightning. I don't buy this either, since ball lightning in winter is exceedingly rare. A third conjecture offered is that it was the lanterns of a large freighter passing in the dark. This too is out of the question, considering the shape and number of the lights, their movements and rapid color cycling, etc. Also, I'm somewhat familiar with maritime traffic in the area, since I live right by the sea, not far from Vuosaari harbor. In fine, I can find no rational explanation for this phenomenon.  I hardly drink at all, certainly not on weekdays, and wasn't tired.  During my service in the armed forces I was never one of those who thought they saw ""something moving"" every time they were on guard duty.  My wife's mental makeup is similar.  In addition, visibility at sea was relatively good. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2011-02-18T00:00:00,,

The Triangle craft slowly crossed the highway at just above tree-level.   The craft was metallic silver and details are as follows:  approx. 300ft from point to the trailing edge of the triangle.  There was a ""fuselage"" type of belly extending about 60 ft from the leading point with a concave area following the fuselage.  In the concave area, their were 2 lights that had a wire mesh covering (the same as found in gyms and other places where the lights are protected).  The first light was Red and the second was white and appeared to be standard bulbs.   The bottom of the craft had what appeared to be rivets along the inner fuselage and outside edge. Three round lights approx. 5 ft. in diameter and appearing as ""pool"" light covers were at the craft's 3 points, illuminated but not ""shining"" down.  The craft had 2 large cylindrical objects above forming a ""cross"".  The Cylindrical objects were larger than the craft in length and we could see a ladder with hoses attaching the two parts.   There was ""gaseous"" cloud that obscured the upper portion of the craft.  The craft was silent and had no effect on the vehicle operation.   After the craft passed overhead, we continued southbound to reach the next exit (Holly) to turn around and chase the craft.  We saw a ""traffic jam"" of vehicles on the North bound side, all flashing their lights heading towards where the craft had passed over the highway.   We speculate that since there was no traffic previously during the 5 minutes the craft took to cross the highway, someone controlled the traffic on both sides and we happened to slip through their blockade.

When we got there we watched a cop come from miles away with lights on and search the roadside for our car.The cop even found the exact turn off we took but we were well hidden.After a while of watching the skies we saw nothing,not even military aircraft.The driver got tired and wanted to leave so we packed it up and got to the road and drove north towards the Dell exit in Skull Valley,Utah.  While driving back I was sitting in the back right seat with my arm across the back of the seat just watching the skies behind us.  Hoping to see something I kept my eye on the sky and we passed this group of small buildings on the side of the road and I caught an orange light in the sky th! at at first I thought was a street light.not wanting to sound like a liar I waited to say anything,looking back at the buildings I realized that every single light in the entire area was a halogen blue/white light on every building and street light post.Finally I look forward and then back and I caught the orange orb in action!  It seemed to just appear out of nowhere,it looked like a light switching on and after about five to ten minutes it would shut off.  Keeping in mind the possibility of flares, I didn't want to get ahead of myself but these didn't fall to the earth or even shoot upwards,but rather levitate in place. the light didn't flicker or flash it was a constant glow of light that gave you the feeling of fear just seeing it.  The sky was dead quiet and there was no possibility of this being any type of ""natural"" aircraft.   After about a half hour of watching these lights appear and disappear they started to release additional lights/orbs in a horizontal motion,each light fired off AND would stop almost immediately and hover in pla! ce for c lose to ten minutes each.finally they stopped appearing but then a fleet of fighter jets came out of the base in attack formation and flew directly into the area of action.  They seemed to patrol the area as they circled the area about three times before flying a little further out, circling around,and disappearing back into the bases RESTRICTED AIRSPACE.Dugway Proving Grounds is one of the only if not THE only base who's airspace is restricted all the way to outer space.  What we saw on this night was NOT conventional nor military aircraft.  Please, I would really love to sit and tell this story to an expert or someone who is interested.",2011-02-18T00:00:00,40.5757,-112.3346

We had recently retired, and were in Kingman to pick up a 5th wheel RV. Upon looking up at a cloud less sky, I could see a silver disc ascending away from me at a slow pace.

If you are I will be happy to help you with location and everything.  I believe it was Stancil that drew the picture I will include first.  The 2nd one is a photo of the rocks closer up.  If you are in the area you will see it as Stancil did.  Photos 2,3 and 4 are of the battery parts left laying there over the years.  The 5th one is the light bars that that are talked about by Stancil and everyone else at the site.  Be more than happy to go get more pictures if you are interested.

Triangular shaped something hovering over a dairy farm.,Fruitland,ID,2010-05-01T06:00:00,triangle,5 minutes,"Occurred : 5/1/2010 06:00  (Entered as : 05/01/10 06:00) Reported: 2/17/2011 7:03:31 AM 07:03 Posted: 2/18/2011 Location: Fruitland, ID Shape: Triangle Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80101.html,"Triangular shaped something hovering over a dairy farm. I’m actually a little embarrassed to be writing this, but here goes.   This happened last year but I’m unsure of the exact date.  I know that it was spring or early summer because it was early morning but light outside, more like dawn when the sun was just coming up, and when I stepped outside, I wasn’t cold at first.  Everyone was still in bed except for me because I tend to get up at 4 or 5 in the morning to get a jump start on my day’s work.  I do medical transcription from home and the back porch has been converted into a home office.  There’s a large window behind my computer and as I sat working, something caught my eye through the curtains.  When I work I tend to get into a sort of ""zone"" where I space out everything that is going on around me and so I’m not really sure if it was movement or light that snapped me out of my work trance, but when I looked up and out my window I spotted something odd.  There were lights that were out of place and didn’t make any sense to me and it piqued my interest enough that I got up from my desk and stepped outside onto my back steps and looked to the east.  I live beside an interstate highway and on the other side of the highway is a dairy farm.  Floating over the dairy was a triangular shaped something.  It was massively huge and made the buildings look small.  It was triangular but not pointy and appeared to be silver and metallic but not really shiny.  The back end that was facing me had large square lights across the entire width so that the part that was facing me was lit up, but it wasn’t exactly bright.  It reminded me of windows in a skyscraper that are lit up that you look at from a distance, bright but not blinding.  I don’t think the sides had lights, but I can’t honestly be sure. It just hovered there and I never seen any sort of movement at all.  I also heard no noise.  I just stood there in awe and kind of overwhelmed.  I honestly can’t explain what was going through my mind but I sort of snapped out of it and realized that my bare feet were getting cold and I went back inside.  I don’t have any sense of time about it so I may have stood there half a minute or it may have been 20 minutes, I don’t know.  I wanted to run in and wake my husband up but felt silly because when I looked out the window again the thing was gone and I have no explanation how it disappeared so quickly because it literally took me just a few seconds to walk inside and look back out the window.  The weird thing is, the entire time I stood there dumbfounded it never occurred to me to grab my camera even though it was only a few feet away in my office. I’ve thought about this a lot over the last year and have almost convinced myself that it was a dream, although I know deep down that it wasn’t, it just was so unreal.  I’ve told a couple of people including my husband and mom, but I don’t tend to spread the word around because I feel embarrassed; it just sounds so farfetched.  On top of that, the how-could-no-one-else-have-seen-it factor comes in.  I mean it was over an active dairy farm and next to a freeway.  In the morning the freeway is slower than during the afternoon, but still, something that huge not being seen seems odd to me.  But then I think about the speed limit being 75 and so maybe people could have missed it.  Or maybe people seen it but zipped by so fast that it didn’t register with them.  I really don’t know.  Like I said, it feels very dream-like but I’m 100% sure it wasn’t a dream. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2011-02-18T00:00:00,43.967,-116.9123

At first, a slow blinking of lights off in the distance in front of me: red on the right, then green on the left, back and forth, blinking as slow as the lights you'd see warning you of an incoming train, but high into the air, and large.  My first thought was obvious, a low flying plane with unusual lights?  But no, for i was approaching it at a speed and closeness that seemed wrong, so then my next thought was of one of those towers, warning the low flying planes of danger, those big flashing red ones high in the sky.  (Even though this was green and red, and way too low, i settled for that answer.) Although I settled for simplicity, for some reason my gaze did not waver and as i approached it, i stared still doubting myself.  Then suddenly it came starkly into view. A solid disk, (almost predictable) shape spinning like a top from chaos' hand.  Spinning so fast and yet moving none, just hovering right above the dark tree line to my right.   Although around me everything was dark, i saw plain as day, the silver exterior forming the eye shaped object to the right over my head.  The top and bottom of the strange thing was still, non-moving but the mid section spun amazingly fast to the right. (like G-force?)  It hovered only 10ish feet above my car, it couldn't have been much bigger than two vans side by side, not a goliath but bigger than me and my vehicle. I immediately pulled my car off the highway, hit my warning lights and without even turning off the car, jumped out, shaking and crying with fear and excitement.  I stood by the side of the road, cars blinding past, and looked longingly and fearfully to where the magnificent and strange thing once was... but nothing.  No sign in the sky that anything ever happened, and though i studied the skies all that night, they did not visit again. (This happened a mere 8 hours ago and I'm still shaken, the whole ride home I couldn't help but look up to the tree line and a sharp pain would enter my heart and i'd be struck with genuine fear and start once more shaking.  It was a beautiful and simply horrifying experience. One, if not the strangest thing to happen to me in my young 23 years.  On the way home, only the soothing voice of my family, boyfriend and George Noory could soothe me.)  To the stars!",2011-04-03T00:00:00,,

Light appeared, lighting up one by one, stayed momentarily, then disappeared. Five minutes later lights returned, I told friend, who turned and saw them too. Lights disappeared. We stood and waited, they reappeared again, in a series of 2-3 round orange lights, one set of three lit up, then the other set which was near but not attached to the other set. At best from far away it looked like two different objects each with three lights, but this is an assumption, we didn't see object, only the lights. At 20:55pm we drove out along Tangerine Rd towards the adjacent town of Marana, we would see the lights on compass setting West. We continued to head West, taking the new Twin Peaks Rd from Tangerine down and over Interstate-10. Along this time we continued to see the series of lights intermittently. We could now tell they were not a plane nor helicopters, not a tower. (They were much higher in the horizon than a tower.) We lost track of them around the intersection of Coachline and Silverbell in Marana. When we lost site of them we felt as if the lights were still slightly West of here, but we felt we were in the immediate area. Lights were definitely high in the sky for us to see from so far away.",2011-04-03T00:00:00,32.4482375,-111.26439999999998

I noticed a small dark object in the sky and it was moving above the Ambassador Bridge.  So with my camera I captured the image of the craft, along with the bridge, for reference purposes.  The photograph showed what appeared to be a 'disc-like' object, but when I zoomed in on it, the object was not a disc, but rather something that looked almost like a fat ""kayak"", navy blue in colour, with one end of the object appearing rounded and of a shiny, light toned silvery metallic material.  From the top of this ""chubby kayak"" appears a light, rounded object. (Since the latter part of 2009, I have taken well over one hundred photographs of unusual/unidentified flying objects - a very wide variety of shapes and sizes - from this location where I live in Windsor), along with numerous pictures of EBEs (extraterrestrial biological entities, most, but not all, of them, ""humanoid"" in appearance.)

Highspeed object changing direction and accelerating in night sky.,St. Gallen (Switzerland),,2011-03-24T20:08:00,light,about 5 seconds,"Occurred : 3/24/2011 20:08  (Entered as : 24/03/11 20:08) Reported: 3/24/2011 4:29:43 PM 16:29 Posted: 4/3/2011 Location: St. Gallen (Switzerland),  Shape: Light Duration:about 5 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80588.html,"Highspeed object changing direction and accelerating in night sky. MOTION: We noticed the object on 1-1:30 o'clock, it moved to 11 o'clock. It slowed down, then changed its direction away from our observation point, then accelerated and quickly disappeared in distance at 11:30 o'clock. i.e. from north/norh-west to south/south-east, then to west/south-west. It did not disappear because of an obscured view. But quickly disappeared in the haze of light pollution (got less bright and vanished, in a bit less than a second). Best guess: All this happened in about 5 seconds, indicating very high speed. There were several regular airplanes in the sky (not close to the object). They were much, much slower (about 10 to 20 times slower). OBJECT: 2 distinct orange/orange-red lights (constant, not flashing - just like regular stars, less bright than regular airplanes). They appeared to belong to the same object. We could not hear any sound. Our surrounding area was quiet. Best guess: The object seemed to be massive in size. The regular airplanes were smaller relative to the size of the object (about 10times smaller). In contrast, the lights of the various airplanes were difficult to distinguish (also they flashed). The object's lights however were clearly distinguishable with space between them. The regular airplanes could be clearly observed despite the haze of light pollution. The object however disappeared westsouthwest in the haze of light pollution. The object was bigger by sight but appeared to be further away than regular airplanes in the sky. AREA: Center of small town, planes fly at high altitude (no airport nearby). Airplanes can be seen in the sky througout the day and evening. Regularly a helicopter from the nearby hospital is seen. We are familiar with both. There were no clouds in the sky, but a haze of light pollution. The belt of orion was to be clearly seen, the object appeared about two to three fists on the right of these stars and disappeared left of the first bright star on the left of orion. WITNESSES: 28.f. and 30.m..  Clear state of mind.  No disposedness to esoteric or religious worldviews.  Doctor and University degrees.  Little time to observe. SUMMARY:  The object was no regular airplane. It was too big to be a military craft - also still too fast. It was no shooting star or comet.  It changed its direction. Speed, distance and size of object were difficult to guess, but were way out of the ordinary. I wish not to be contacted about anything unrelated to this incident. Thank you.

It did not have a trail behind it or lights like a plane would, it made no noise as it flew through the sky at a fast pace.   It looked about the size of a basketball, but I could not tell how far away the object was from us.

We were parked at the Lake Quanah Parker Dam Spillway 'turnabout'/fishing area, standing on the pavement facing Lake Quanah Parker (due North) and observing the ""Big Dipper"" just overhead when we observed a a very bright stationary object.  The object was positioned just slightly to the right of center between the constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor and just below the constellation Draco.  The object did not appear to have any clearly defined edges when perceived by the naked eye or when viewed through binoculars (Bushnell 12x21 compact.)  The glow of he object appeared to be almost a cream color, not quite white, but not quite yellow.  The object's luminosity and apparent diameter appeared to be fluctuating at regular intervals of approximately 1/30th of a second.  The objects diameter (when at its smallest) was roughly the equivalent of 5 normal stars, or approximately the size of the planet Jupiter - viewed when it appears closest to Earth.  When the object appeared largest, its apparent diameter was close to 7-8 stars or nearly twice the size of the planet Jupiter. The object appeared to remain motionless for more than a minute (at the location mentioned above) and then suddenly it began a steady arc in a northern direction (toward the constellation Draco) then curved gradually south-eastern (making a tear-drop shaped loop) and proceeded onward in a south-easterly path, now at a much more rapid rate of speed.  From the moment its motion began until it disappeared somewhere near the far south-eastern horizon, 18 seconds had elapsed.   The object did not appear to be flying low to the ground, (seemed significantly higher than normal aircraft would be flying) though without any clear reference point or measurements, it is not possible to discern the object's actual size, speed or altitude. The object did not appear to make any audible sound(s)and no discernible effects were apparent regarding; nearby mechanical devices (cars, cell phones), persons, plant or animal life. My friend and I are both amateur astronomers, experience with military as well as more than 15 years each with astronomy/stargazing.  We have lived in the immediate area for 8 and 10 years respectively and have never observed an object like this, or in this location.   Neither one of us knows what this object is, but we are both clear that it is neither traditional military nor civilian commercial aircraft.  The object's motion is neither consistent with a meteor or any other known natural phenomena.  While consulting the NUFORC director, I was informed that the international space station was not visible from that location and at that time. Weather: 78 degrees F., light occasional winds at 10-15mph., slightly humid, two faint displays of apparent distant lightening occurred approximately 35 min. prior to observation of this object. Air traffic:  Civilian/Commercial air traffic was high just prior to the sighting but there were no aircraft within the area of the object, at that time. NOTE: When observing the same area the night following this observation a fast moving military aircraft was observed making 7 great loop-like passes of the entire wildlife refuge as well as the nearby military base (Ft. Sill, Army Post) within a time frame of 16 min., and at a fairly moderate altitude, slightly lower than normal air traffic in that region.  Neither of us has ever observed this kind of military behavior in the decade or so that we have both lived in this area.  Ft. Sill is well known for its loud artillery training exercises, but never for its military flight maneuvers.  The nearest Air Force installation is Altus AFB in Altus, Oklahoma, ~45 miles west of the location of the sighting.  During the sighting, attempts were made to photograph the object by the use of a built-in cell phone camera, no image was clear, the screen frame appeared entirely black.",2011-06-12T00:00:00,34.635224117647056,-98.47288176470587

My son and I ran out to see her pointing toward the northern sky. Across from out house is an open field, where baseball and soccer is played. North in the sky was a slowly moving flashing/flickering ball shaped light.  As it flickered it appeared to shift shape and color.  It varied from a whitish color to an orange-red color.  The shape seemed to change during the color change, from a roundish shape to a slight horizontal oblong shape with a dome above and below the oblong. It continued to move westward. My son ran inside for binoculars while my daughter ran in to get my camera.  She was able to take one picture of it.

I could see the two lights in close proximity clearly and they were as bright or just a fraction dimmer than other stars in the night sky.   The North Star, directly at my back while looking at the lights in question, was twice as bright as these two lights visible to the naked eye. The weather conditions were completely clear sky, with no visible moon. The object/ lights observed were approximately 45 degrees over the horizon line.  The compass bearing to the object was 160 or nearly due South.   At arm’s length the two lights were approximately the width of my fingernail on my smallest finger.  I observed the object and attempted to take photos with my iphone but it failed to capture any images of the object as it was too dark.   I went inside and got a pair of binoculars to better view the lights. Upon focusing in with my Nikon Eagleview 8-24x25mm binoculars, I noticed a third light, forming a triangle formation.   The formation the third light was dimmer than the first two and made what appeared to be a triangle object look like a long very pointed craft.  The angles appeared to be 30 degrees and two 60 degree angle near what looked like the base.   The two brighter lights at the ‘base’ of the object looked as though they had a yellow tint to them, much like a car’s headlights would, not a bluish tint as the other stars around it.  The third, more dim light also had this characteristic also.  The yellow color, and the proximity of the two brighter lights, and the fact that usually there are not bright lights in the sky in that area of sky are what attracted my attention.  The third, more dim light was approximately double the distance from the first two lights as the first two lights were wide. Together the three lights formed a long, slender very pointed triangle as they appeared when viewed through the binoculars. I called the NUFORC hotline and was advised to submit a written report.  I was also advised to take photos if possible.  My camera is not operational, so I woke a neighbor and borrowed her camera.   After taking multiple shots, I was only able to get one picture that captured the image I was viewing clearly through my binoculars and with the naked eye.  I first saw this object at approximately 10pm, and noted the time as the  10 o’clock news had just come on.   The camera used was a Casio Exilim 7.2 Megapixel digital camera. Flash was turned off, and I was zoomed in ¾ of maximum zoom. Was only able to capture one picture showing object.  I tried different zooms, different settings for lighting, everything I could.  I could not get another picture to show the object.  It is 2 hours 17 minutes past time I first noticed object and object is still visible in sky.  From my front door, the object was showing on my iphone compass as bearing 160 degrees from true north.  I extended my arm out and estimated the angle to be approximately 45 degrees off the horizon from me.  The horizon is light as I was overlooking the downtown davenport to the east, which borders the Mississippi river. It was much higher than the horizon and could not have been radio towers or anything the like.  There is an Army National Guard Aviation Unit flying ch-47 Chinooks was stationed out of the regional airport to the west.  Looking directly at the object,  the big dipper was at 298 degrees  from my position, to the NW. the airport where the national guard unit is stationed is approximately bearing of 21 degrees, almost due north of my location.  No other constellation was visible anywhere near the object I writing to report.  Usually the Orion constellation is visible in the general area but more to the east but could not see the Orion this evening. Weather conditions were clear. Storms were here most of the day but cleared off early afternoon. By 7pm CST all clouds had for the most part cleared off leaving clear skies.   At the time of writing it is still clear.  No meteorites are visible.  No heat lighting is visible.   I am familiar with most known military aircraft, NATO and Soviet/Russian manufacture, both fixed wing and rotary.  This did not resemble any aircraft I have ever seen. The object made no noise, and is still at the time of writing stationary in the night sky. Aircraft have passed underneath this object and have not changed course to avoid it.  This object appears to be much higher than the air traffic transiting below it.  Perhaps this was stellar objects that simply looked like an aircraft?  Perhaps it is unidentified?  Given the proximity of the 3 objects I do not know what to make of this.",2011-06-03T00:00:00,41.555164116094986,-90.5987598944591

GLASGOW SCOTLAND. SPHERES OF RED LIGHT IN THE NIGHT SKY.  I live in the north east of Glasgow Lanarkshire Scotland.  On the 8th.of August 2010 I looked out of my window and saw in the sky, a light, travelling in a SE. to NW. direction.  I went outside and looked up at the light, it was red to orange in colour and in a figure of eight configuration with the two balls of the eight off set.  I watched this light and when it was almost directly overhead it slowed, stopped, then faded into two little white dots, and disappeared.  I realised that what looked like a single figure of eight shaped light was actually two separate round red lights.  On the 14th.of Aug, my wife and I saw a red ball of light come over the Campsie Fells (which are 10 miles distant to the north) and fly towards us in a N. to S. direction.  When at a distance of approximately one quarter of a mile to our left it slowed, stopped, then disappeared.  About 30 seconds later another red light appeared over the Campsie Fells and travelled towards us, it slowed then stopped at exactly the same spot as did the first. This went on at very regular intervals for some time, red lights travelling towards us, stopping and then disappearing. Although I didn't time them, the lights took about one and a half minutes to travel the 10miles from the Campsie Fells. Later that night I looked over towards the Kilsyth Hills which are really a continuation of the Campsie fells and saw a red light, then another come over these hills and disappear at some distance from us. There is no way these lights could be Chinese lanterns.  They travelled at speed in the same trajectory, stopped, then disappeared in exactly the same place.  On the 17th.of August we saw two more red lights travelling in a NW. to SE. direction then disappear.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,,

Noticed a brightly flashing object in the WSW sky.  Thought it was an airplane because it had several different colors being displayed.  It was the brightest object in the sky except for Jupiter which was to the east area of the sky.  Moon not visible as it had already set. As I watched I realized the flashing lights did not move in relation to the trees in the yard of the house next door to the south of me.  After 5 minutes (40 miles of jet airliner flight distance) it still remained in the same position. I walked to where my driveway meets the street some 100 feet west of where I first spotted them to get a better view of the lights.  They were still in the same place. I returned to my house side door and retrieved my 20X80 binoculars to determine if I could see anything with the use of them.  Going back to the driveway entrance I used the binoculars and could see that the lights were changing colors and very quickly.  Red, blue, white, green colors were visible with the glasses but of course the image was all over the place. I placed them on the top of the fence post at the entrance of my driveway and although it steadied the image somewhat it was still only a bouncing globe of lights moving around.  Like trying to watch a star with high power glasses, almost impossible. Although I watched the lights for about 30 minutes, less the time to get the binoculars, they appeared to remain the same intensity and with multicolors. The position was about where I would expect to see Arcturus, the star the tail of the Big Dipper leads to.  Maybe it was that star, although I have looked at it hundreds of times, including from the flight deck of jet airliners.  I have never noticed it have coloring and flashing brightly like it did tonight. The object was about 35 degrees above the horizon and the sky is clear although there could have been some smoke from the forest fires that occur this time of year adding particulates to the atmosphere and perhaps giving a view that I have never seen before.

Calmly we were discussing and chatting, when my mother asked me, ""What is that?""  I got up and went toward the fireplace to look around the canopy opening.  I then saw a glowing orb shape the size was a quarter of the size of the moon.  The color was gold orange and the object was slowly crossing the horizon. I went through possibilities in my mind of what it could be.  It was not a planet as it moved. It was not a coloring changing star. It did not move in the fashion of an airplane.  It did pause in flight. There was no sound. We went onto the deck of our trailer to follow its flight path.  The object was pulsating in intensity and brightness.  The object remained in the same spot for about a minute.  Then we lost sight of the object behind foliage. I went toward my mother’s vehicle which was parked toward the south to see if the object to could be seen at a father distance or if changing height would allow better viewing.  We went back onto the deck of our trailer from the car area while looking for the object to see where it had gone. I then saw the object change direction and it increased in size coming toward us.

I myself in the driver seat while my mother riding up front, sat in the passenger seat.  When the sighting occurred my mother and I were the only ones who were able to witness it because my girlfriend and my nephew sat in the back seat, meanwhile my nephew was sound asleep. Next, we seen a streak of light above us, similar to a shooting star.  First it appeared to be a shooting star, then in astonishment, it appeared to be in a horizontal oval, it didn't just shoot through the sky fading from sight.  At the sight of this abnormal object it seemed to be traveling in the same direction we were headed, but to my suprises not as slow as an airplane or helicopter, and at first not as fast as a shooting star.  Yet it seemed to be going at an acceptionally fast speed.  It also didn't have any sound, in reference to any airplane or jet.  Which a jet would have been a good explanation except the fact that a jet doesn't fly silently. In addition, this object in the sky didn't appear to be flying at a high altitude.  In fact it seemed pretty low as if it were a helicopter trying to find someone or something.  At first it was just a stream of light then it came lower then it was, not by much but still a little lower.  Then it suddenly picked up speed and the aluminescence grew into a stream of light trailing a ball of light.  Then it seemed to reach a higher area in the sky and at this moment it changed colors immediately from white, to red, then instantly blue and within a fraction of a second it was gone.  It almost seemed to have maybe gone behind a thick cloud, due to the weather we've been having.  Then my mother and I realized, there wasn't any clouds in the immediate area of the night sky. Ultimately, the sight was both shocking and surprising, given it all occured within the most two seconds, or less.  I confidentally believe what I witnessed wasn't anything in our United States technological capabilities, unless it was an SR-71 Blackbird in central Floridas air space.  It's one of the only flying objects to my knowledge that would fly close to the speed, without sound, and disappear from sight instantaniously with little conflict, compared to what I witnessed.  Besides the SR-71 doesn't hit an immediate ""warp speed"" and aluminate in red then blue and disappear.  I know it sounds tampered with but the object had a blunt oval shape to my sight, possibly due to the engle of visual but to my knowledge it was practicaly oval.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,29.153170016207454,-82.11931701782821

I photographed two jets passing and waited. Just them at 10.39.24 i see a silver star appear exactly were i saw the V UFO yesterday. I jumped up with my camera totally pumped and excited aimed the camera and it wouldnt focus, i switched to manual and shot, switched to auto and shot more. The Probe started moving slowly to the east from the west with the direction of the wind, clouds were slowly passing by it. As the probe passed over head i tried to get some video but it would nt work  i started shooting as best i could, i then see a jet coming rite at the Probe and i thought the probe would disapear but i didnt, the people in the jet must have seen the probe as it passed pretty close but both jet and UFO were in a light fuzz hazzy cloud, my camera wouldnt focus, the jet then went by, i shot more, ! then another jet was coming rite at it again and it passed by in another fuzzy cloud, my camera wouldnt focus, if the pilots missed it they shouldnt be pilots i thought. I was alittle frustrated because the jet and UFO would had been great shots. As i shot more photos a jet higher up than the UFO came from the East heading West i snapped great focused shots of the UFO and jet. As the UFO probe headed to the east towards the tree i ripped off as many shots as i could until it went out of sight. In total i got 110 shots as it passed overhead. I then felt it wasnt over so i waited looking around for a few minutes seeing nothing, i grabbed the camera coffee and radio swatting mosquitoes in the miserable zombie heat and headed in the house, i looked over the far trees and over them i saw a flashing object moving west, reminded me of snow goose in flight then i remembered my Chatham sighting of the object that flashed like a snow goose, i quickly sat my coffee and radio down turn! ed as fast as i could to shoot it and it was gone in a split s! econd, i t could have been a Ring-Billed gull, but ill never no cause i missed it!!.

Looked at me like an aircraft flying very fast but when i noticed it for more than 3 seconds, it wasn't only going in one direction.  It was like, going left, right, going far away and then coming closer, looked like a bulb in the sky playing around. i could only see a light... it was too far off for me to notice if there is any craft. ONLY LIGHTS ... dull bluish white light. Almost like a star... It kept going left, right, up and down for about 10-15 seconds approx and then it was joined by another 3 lights, all lined up horizontally and they shot up in the sky all of the sudden.

My husband was in the passenger seat and my daughter and her boyfriend were in the back seat.  I thought that either the engine was acting up or I had blown a tire.  Luckily we were able to get off the highway quickly as the exit was not far from where our car began to shake.  Once we were on the ramp to exit, the car immediately began to drive smoothly as if there was nothing wrong.   We drove to the nearest service station where my husband checked the tires and then under the hood trying to find the cause of the shaking which had ceased on the exiting ramp.  He couldn't find anything wrong with the tires and everything looked fine under the hood.  He checked the oil level and it was down a quart so he added some new oil. We decided to continue our trip on a smaller, less travelled highway (Highway 2) which ran through small towns and cities, just in case we were to run into car problems. We passed through London Ontario and approached Thamesford Ontario.  My daughter noticed a very bright light in the night sky through the front car window.  She described it as being a ""very large bright star"" and it confused her because ""it was 20 times brighter than any other star in the sky"".  My husband assured her that it was most likely an airplane and that it would be gone within a few minutes.   As we drove closer to this bright object, we all realized that it was not moving at all and was just hovering about 100 to 150 feet above someone's farm property at the east end of the town.  Because I was driving, I did not get a very good clear look at the object as we passed by it (it was to my left, now just north of the highway, but my daughter, her boyfriend and my husband were able to get a much better view and were able to fix their eyes on it for about fifteen or more seconds.  Here is our description of the actual object:  It appeared to be rectangular shaped (the colour and material was difficult to determine as it was nighttime), about 40 to 50 feet long and 20 to 30 feet wide, with many bright lights including 2 large white headlights, a red pulsating light at the back and a few bluish lights on the side.  Because it was higher than us, we didn't see the top of it, but the bottom (floor) of it had about 8 or 10 'panel-like sections'.  Because it was so low to the ground, we assumed at first the possiblity of it being a helicopter, but after observing it's shape and size, the extremely bright and colourful lights and it's lack of any sound, we immediately realized that it couldn't have been a helicopter or any other familiar aircraft for that matter.  I continued to drive for a few minutes eastward on Highway 2 but turned around and headed back towards Thamesford hoping to stop and get possible video footage of the object.  When we reached the area where we had seen the object, it was no longer there nor anywhere in the sky.  This confused us because, under normal circumstances, something this large and bright would have remained visible in the sky for a long period of time, and there were no airports nearby.",2011-03-23T00:00:00,43.0614,-80.9943
"Glowing orb ascended from my woods, hovered above the trees, trailed behind a plane, stopped, than finally disappeared.",Belle Mead,NJ,2011-03-08T18:30:00,light,~1min & 30sec,"Occurred : 3/8/2011 18:30  (Entered as : 03/8/11 18:30) Reported: 3/14/2011 3:55:50 PM 15:55 Posted: 3/23/2011 Location: Belle Mead, NJ Shape: Light Duration:~1min & 30sec",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80471.html,"Glowing orb ascended from my woods, hovered above the trees, trailed behind a plane, stopped, than finally disappeared. Earlier that sunset around 6:15pm, I was coming home from the DMV, and as I was driving I noticed something odd when I looked over towards the sun; there were these white comet like streaks, about mid horizon altitude in a cluster of 3 or 4.   At first I thought I saw a comet, about the size of an Inch held out at arms length, but It seemed practically stationary, or at least 10x slower than an airplane would move judging on the intensity of the lights emitting from the objects.  The tails were strange too because they didn't disperse at all as smoke would.  Rather, the length of the tail would correspond to the speed at which it was moving, leaving behind no remnants of its track.  However, as they slew down the tails would retract, and when they sped up the tail would drag along at a constant opacity. About 1min later at another red light, I looked up and saw that one of the comet-looking objects now had 2 tails facing towards one another as if it had divided; one of which was facing towards the sky and the other slanting downwards.  Another one soon appeared out from a cloud that was above the one facing the sky.  At that point I didn't know what to think of it. As I pulled into my driveway at 6:30pm, still thinking about what I had saw, I stopped midway and glanced over towards the horizon, and that’s when I saw a white glowing orb through the woods.  After I was sure of its unnaturalness when it slowly ascended from behind and hovered over the trees, I quickly pulled out my phone and captured a video of it until my phone memory was full.  I reviewed the my video and it includes a plane passing it while the object it trailed behind and then at the last split second when my phone stopped recording, it appears to have taken off at the speed of light looking like an inverted television screen when its turned off. My curiosity got the best of me and I ended up watching the sky all night since I couldn't sleep, and at 2:30am I witnessed another Ufo on the opposite side of my house from where I saw the first one.  I had a video camera nearby and shot it, but the video doesn’t show much detail because of the lack of light.  From my perspective, I saw a star sized light above the trees that jumped different directions and than it jumped to the edge of the woods closest to me at tree level, where I was able to see a shadowy oval outline with the light at the tip. It continued to slowly hover towards my house and came within 20 ft of the rooftop, and than just as it was about to pass over head it flashed two lights on each side and disappeared in the direction from where it came from.  When It disappeared a faint flash of light can be seen at the top left side of the screen. The next night, 3/10/11 at 1am, I yet again witnessed another above the woods where I saw the first at.  This one was seemed to pulsate and hover just as the others did, except it looked more like a glowing disk with an orb underneath and a small flashing light on the side in a triangle formation. I decided to investigate the woods the next day and found two questionable clearings of trees in the densest parts of the area.  There were trees pilled that had been ripped out from the roots and the trees in the ground surrounding the perimeter were pushed outwards on an angle, making a full sky clearing above.

I came to find out later that the other lighs were jets on a particular flight path, and are completely explainable. But there is one light that is not. the one that was really close. I hear an apache, well what I am assuming is an apache coming from the southern part of the sky, from what I am guessing is williams air force base. I thought at first that the white light was the helicopter until the helicopter came in to view and started to chase the white light. It chased the light at very high speeds probably 200+ miles an hour and was as close to him as one football field at times. I remarked that it was strange that the light wsa heading in the opposite direction as us yet we could still see it's headlights. I also said it is strange because plan! es aren't allowed to get that close together. The only was it makes sense to me in my head is if an orb of light with intelligent control was either being held by a silent helicopter which had no flasher and pretty good but not to fantastic maneuvering capability better than the one that was chasing it at least.  or being moved under it's own power.  I think mabey the light was something that the helicopter was supposed to follow as like training or somehting it didn't make a lot of sense in my head so I thought i would report it. I googled it before I came here and see that alot of people have seen what I have, there is even pictures.I don't know if this is explained or not actually. But it was really strange.

I was sitting, facing East and the California side of the horizon from my home in Arizona.  I am very, very familiar with the flight patterns from L.A. to Phoenix and back.  Those travel East to West and visa versa and only shift latterly North and South depending on weather and other circumstances.  I'll say that I see A LOT of interesting things in the sky and often around here.  This one was absolutely amazing.  Once I realized it was not a plane, I thought it could be the space shuttle.  That had landed the day before so that was out.  I then reasoned that it was the Mir.  I ran and grabbed my binoculars to confirm. Not so much.  I've seen the Mir 3 times in the last 5 years - Once with my naked eye at about the same time at night, once through my 12"" dobby telescope and one other time just after dusk with my naked eye.  This was not the Mir to the best of my know! ledge.  It glowed more brightly than any star in the sky.  It was a distinct orange ""glow"" which looks similar to reflected light from the Shuttle and Mir but through my binoculars, the light was steady, unwavering and stayed the same luminosity across the entire night sky.  It travelled at approximately 1400 mph.  I am basing that on what I have watched hundreds of times, commercial airliners traveling at anywhere from 600 to 700 mph.  I could not tell altitude beyond about 30,000 feet.  Through the binoculars, I could not make out any formation of wings, additional lights/strobes or physical features.  To me, it looked exactly like a brightly glowing disk since the light was not round.  It was very slightly oval.  There was no atmospheric disruption that I could see.  There was no propulsion or exhaust that I could see - Just a very bright and very steady moving object traveling from North to South in the clean night sky.  The moon was visible but only a quarter-moon washed out the stars.",2011-03-23T00:00:00,34.506735795454546,-114.29056420454545

My home is surrounded by tall pine trees that only leave one decent sized, maybe 500 feet in diameter, that offers a clear view of the western sky.   After standing there for several minutes, enough to smoke 2 cigarettes and looking at the various stars, I noticed that a star-like object was moving slowly from North to Southeast.  The size was that of a smaller star that is normally seen in the night sky and it was unremarkable in its appearance,at first. Having covered half the distance of my circular viewing area of the sky the object began to dramatically slow and also began to slightly zig-zag and its path began to ever-so slightly curve to a more Southern direction.  During this time the object began to slowly become brilliantly illuminated for about 10-20 seconds. The illumination was as bright as a welder's arc with a perfect bright white glow. I'd like to point out have lived very near NASA's Kennedy Space Center and I have seen every modern rocket and the Space Shuttles launch and take flight in person several times and there is nothing during the launch stages that can compare to the stunning brilliance of the illumination of this craft. I know this was not a shooting star or meteor entering the atmosphere, first, because it slowed and also the peak of illumination faded to that of what it appeared like before it began to illuminate, That of a normal star's brightness,and once it decreased in intensity, it sped off out of view. At the time it became illuminated that I began laughing so loud that my wife was awakened in wonder. Although she didn't see the event, she saw my confusion and excitement. I have never seen such illumination of anything, natural or man made, in our skies. I was in total amazement not only because of the brightness of this object but because it slowed, lit up so,so brilliantly as if it wanted me to see it and then accelerated off in a nonlinear direction that it previously had been traveling.",2011-06-12T00:00:00,35.2044,-85.3255

We'd just driven past a large corrugated barn with a red tractor parked outside when my friend in the passenger seat noticed a blue/grey disk to his left. I also saw this as soon as he pointed it out, and I parked my car up on the side of the lane and we both got out.  The disk was slate grey in colour and roughly one mile away, perhaps at an altitude of 1500 ft.  For the full space of time we watched the disk it moved westward at a slow pace (100 kn?).  The object itself was not remarkably proportioned, just the size of a typical Cessna prop. aircraft.  After a few minutes the disk had moved too far away for us to see properly.  That is all we saw.

At 10pm, object was still in the sky. I was outside looking at the stars, and as Orion came into my view I thought what I witnessed was the International Space Station flying by.  As I watched the object, it moved north, south, and then to my amazement did a full circle in the sky.  It returned to its position to the west of Orion.  The object was a slightly off color, amber-orange.   I went inside my house and got out a pair of binoculars to see if I could get a better understanding of what I just saw.  Once I looked at the object through the binoculars it appeared to be in our atmosphere, too close to be a star.  And once more, startled me as it moved in the same pattern while I was looking at it through the binoculars.  I was under the impression it was trying to disguise itself as a star.  I felt the urgent need to report this to some one.  I used Google and found your website. I am a student at AIU.  I am getting my master’s degree in IT/Internet Security in 3 years.  I have lived in the country most of my life.  I have only seen one other irregular star while living out here.  And that one blew my mind so much I was scared to go outside at night for weeks.  That time, an object similar in color, appeared to be flying in front and around the moon.  It looked like it was heading straight for me, and then when it got a short distance away from the moon, the object split into two objects and continued on their separate ways.  That was several years ago now.  I did not know that I could report such incidences.

This pin point of light was very small in diameter, a little bigger than a period in this sentence,making it difficult to locate if I took my eyes off it.   I observed this object for approx 10 minutes,  It traveled north - south and after it went over my house roof I re-adjusted my visibility position and sat down in a chair on my deck and noticed that the light got dimmer.  I have seen the space shuttle and Iss and know that they traverse an enormous distance while in sight- so this thing could have also.  At the end of my sighting the Round pinpoint of light got fainter and fainter until I was out of my visual range, As though It was going even to greater elevations from a stoped position until I faded away.   I alway look up and scan the skys because I have seen many strang thing in the skys over the years, and this one was special because it occured in broad day light!

My son came out too, but he was convinced it was some sort of flare system and went inside pretty quickly.  He wouldn't have thought that if he had seen the one pair slow down then speed up (not typical of a flare, which uses graduated release). He did have a point that there were only lights, though.  I, not being a very big believer in aliens, am pretty privy on cloaking and I know that it is nearly impossible to cloak emissions meant to propel an object relative to another object (in this case the ship would have been pushing against air).   My daughter pointed out that it had a ""watery look"" which I assume was the lensing effect a cloak might have.  Shortly after, my friend called up and asked me if I had seen the ""Lights in the sky"" and if my lights had flickered (which they hadn't).

Description:  The UFO had at least a dozen to fifteen strings of solid, soft white lights that appeared to be along the front in a crescent moon shaped fashion.  I could not fully tell if the lights were attached to a solid body, or were separate entities flying in a bowed formation.  The lights appeared to be spaced equally apart along the front and were not blinking as with most aircraft.  I estimated the sixe from one end to the other to be at least several hundred yards long.  It was massive, but graceful. The UFO made no sound as it moved across the sky almost directly overhead.  There was no sound after the UFO passed either.  The speed was constant and it did not change course.  It stayed due north until it vanished out of sight.

After I pointed up for my other two friends to see it we began to try to figure out what it was.  It looked like an upright object gray in color not shiny kind of dull.  It did not make a sound that we could hear but there was a lot of background noise from traffic turning away from it.   The ball of what looked like fire or an orange light began to dim as it got closer to the track.  We reasoned that it was not a plane or a chopper since it did not have flashing or front facing lights.   Finally the light went completely out and we still saw the solid object in the air steadily moving in the same direction.   One of my friends got spooked and demanded we leave.

They looked to be staggered in the sky way too low to be stars.  There's no airport strip or lit towers East of Denver in Weld County, so it couldnt have been a plane.  Satallites don't move like these lights did, they moved around eachother shining bright and fading and then reappearing brighter then ever.  They had to have been there for atleast 20-30 mins, and I watched about of 25 mins of it.  Its was breath taking, I had to call my mom. I'm just looking for a logical explination, I've seen these lights in the Eastern sky a few times before, always in the east though, and I've NEVER seen 5 of them together this completly blows my mind.

Light visible in daylight. What was unusual about this was the light was high in the sky with a tail and not a planet.  This was not stationary.  My questions are three fold: 1) space station but why would it have a tail ?  2) Satellite in decaying orbit ? 3) Did we have a comet pass close by ?  And to add a forth given the recent reports - was this a high flier leaving a con-trail ?  (high flier being UFO as in unidentified object) not implying anything but 'unidentified'.  Flight path was straight and a SSE direction over the North West region and to the left of the crescent moon which at the time appeared overhead but in a Southerly 10 O'clock position, so not directly overhead. I am thinking space junk or Earth born stuff rather than other worldly craft. It was a bright light so you couldn't identify it as a craft with the naked eye and I didn't have binocs or telescope. I am a tech. and applicati! on Admin. Attention to detail is required.  Bare in mind I viewed this from a moving vehicle and could not stop to get a better look.

It was not at the altitude of normal jet traffic, but seemed to be at a level that small aircraft would fly.  What caught my eye was that it wasn’t traveling at the normal speed of an aircraft.  It was moving slower and it was much brighter than what a small plane looks like.  I stared at it and also noticed that it seemed to be wavering back and forth a little as it moved from the northwest to the southeast.  I watched it travel for about 2 minutes and thought that as it passed me I’d see a blinking light or something that would indicate it’s just a plane or helicopter, but all of a sudden the bright light just went out and I never saw it again.  I stayed outside for a few more minutes hoping to see it again, but it never appeared.  It was a crystal clear night with ! lots of stars out.

I was driving home west to east on the Massachusetts Turnpike. 2. The first object was very bright, slightly off to the left of me at about 10o'clock high.( Auburn, MA). The second and third objects were also very bright but had a twinkling appearance at first. 3. First object - I thought it was a plane with it's approach lights on. The second and third objects were not seen for another 10 minutes or so after the first. I was still getting my thoughts together about the first object when the second two appeared to my left, about 9 o'clock horizontally and 10 o'clock vertically. 4. First object - was right in my line of sight so I get an eye on it ( I was travelling at 70 MPH in traffic so I couldn't stop or listen for sounds. Second and third objects - really got my attention, as they initially looked the same as the first one. These seemed to appear suddenly, but they may have moved rapidly from behind me to the left. After watching the first object for 2-3 minutes and trying to recall exactly what I saw, when these other two appeared, I observed them much more closely, as closely as you can when your are driving at highway speeds.Interestingly, when the second two objects appeared, i saw a lot of brake lights go on around me so I think there was a multiple group of people, including truck drivers, who saw these last two objects. 5. Object 1 - First appeared in front of me, about 10 O'Clock high. Initially, I thought it was a plane with approach lights, however the object was not moving, or if it was, it was very slowly moving. I was approaching the Auburn 140 exit, and within 5 miles I had driven right under the object. I could make out two white lights, side by side, no wing lights ( starboard / port red and white  ) and nothing blinking. Where the object should have had some type of shape, there was a misty, cloudy mass. You could see a trail emanating from the lights ( this could have been mist or fog). The best way to describe what this looked like was as if you looked at the afterburner of a twin engine fighter jet, however these were definitely white lights, not exhaust flames). I drove right under the object and lost it once it was behind me. I did not see much if any movement. 5. Object 2 and 3 - This was the most detailed. I was trying to put my thoughts together on the first object and was approaching I 495 eastbound when I caught a very similar light to my left. I then noticed there were two objects, both glittering brightly and moving north to south, about 9-10 o'clock high on the horizon in front of me. The cars in front of me started to tap their brakes, so I had to watch the road as I watched the objects. These objects did move, Object 1 fairly fast for what seemd to be 1-15 seconds unti, it was right over I90. When the object was about 11 o'clok in front of me, the bright glittering stopped and I could make out red and white lights, and I saw strobing. My first thought was airplane, but as i got closer ( again, the object slowed way down to where I drove right under it), I could make out a triangular or circular pattern. The center of the object had that blurry/misty appearance, so you couldn't see an actual shape in the darkness. What mad! e this object so strange was that the strobing was coming from the white lights; the red lights were not blinking. The white lights had a pattern of 1-2, half second, 1-2, half second. I could see a bluish haze in the middle of this light array as I drove under it. I lost it as I passed under. The third object  was the most active, but also the least viewed. As I was watching object 2, Object 3 remained ""glittery"" and was at 9-10 o'clock vertically. It moved rapidly from my left to about 2 clock to my right off in the distance and then just hovered there for what I estimate to be 2-3 minutes, then moved off to the south. I did not overtake this object, but it did look the same from a distance with object 2 until object 2's ""glitter"" stopped and the shape and red/white lights were observed. I am an ex-Navy airdale, so I'm somewhat familiar with aircraft and helicopters. I wish I could have pulled over to observe these objects from a stationary position and listened for engine noise. What was most striking was the slowness / lack of movement / lack of standard running lights / north south direction ( Logan was east of the sightings)and the clarity of the lights and the misty looking area where you would normally see the outline of an aircraft. If they were aircraft, they would have to have been helicopters based on the changing speeds and my ability to overtake them in a car, however, the lighting patterns and lack of a hard shape just doesn't add up. Hopefully someone else will be reporting this to you so you can compare notes. I have drawn the objects so I don't forget them with time.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,,

I was talking to a friend on my phone when I noticed in the dark bluish skies a stationary changing light.  It was quite familiar to me, because over the past couple of years family members and I have seen these lights.  But, the difference this time was that these lights were much closer than previous sightings. I quickly ended my phone conversation and ran inside to tell my Father and grab my new camera (Canon Powershot ELPH 300 HS) that I had purchased about a week previous.  Both of us went to the back porch overlooking the Great Salt Lake and Antelope Island.  I attempted to take a still picture of the object, but was unable to capture anything visible.  Not having used my video feature yet, I tried recording a video which I did with much better success. I recorded six segments of video on my camera from lengths of about 1:30 to 8:00 minutes long.  We both made observations on the closeness of the object (approximately 75 miles from our location).  Because of the closeness of the object we could see a better view of the rotating lights and movement  of the craft from previous sightings. We could see the distinct rotation of the craft that made it look like a tumbling Rubix's cube.  It seemed to stay stationary in the night sky.  If there was movement it was slight and westward.  The lights on the object changed frequently between reds, blues, oranges and greens.  It looked as though it was moving in a Disco light fashion, very fast and very rapid.  Occasionally the middle of the object would pulsate into a black circle and then retract. We observed this object for approximately 25 minutes until the light got more and more faint into the night sky.  We couldn't determine if the object was moving westward over the Great Salt Lake or Dugway Testing Center.  But, there were no sudden movements or set orbit during those 25 minutes.  We couldn't imagine this was an aircraft even though the Salt Lake International Airport and Hill Air Force base are nearby.  We ruled out a planet, because of the tumbling rotation and brilliant lights.  It could easily be a drone observing something, possibly towards the Dugway Testing Center?    Whatever it was we have been seeing this object over the west skies of the Great Salt Lake and Dugway Testing Center the past couple of years.  Nothing as close as we saw on the night of May 4, 2011.   I would love any logical explanation.",2011-05-12T00:00:00,40.88074394904459,-111.8254974522293

It got as bright as the brightest star in the sky and then slowly started dimming back down.  I noticed the movement was not consistent in direction or speed.  It seemed to slow down and speed up slightly, and it seemed to drift as if not on a straight course.  It got very dim and then eventually faded out of sight.  At times I have thought that maybe it is a satellite or the ISS that is casting an inconsistent reflection from the sun due to its angle, but that is just me speculating.

Shortly after the helicopter passed, we were conversating about something unimportant when I couldn't help but cut in and say, ""it could just be a plane or another copter...but look at that thing, it looks so weird"". And the guys looked up and agreed, it was a very strange looking craft.  But I always throw out something like ""its probably just a governement plane""...so I don't look like an idiot assuming crazy things. But the guys confirmed to me that they'd never seen anything like that before, and that it was quite low and easily visible at first then gained altitude quickly but almost unnoticeably as it moved North-bound and away from us.  Way high above it, we noticed and heard a commercial jet-plane as it flew Southwest, and after the trailing engine sounds from the jet passed (and the UFO still in sight, slowly and very closeby) we were SURE that this object was emitting no noise.  Within about 15 seconds it seemed to go from a few hundred feet above us, to about 30,000ft with effortless grace. The craft itself had a large dark gray/black rectangular body.  It was hard to see the actually body in the night sky, but it was the lights that were most obvious to me.  And all that we could really desribe of the craft was the ventral surface (or underside), being the only side we could see very clearly.  It had 4 lights in its four corners, all gleaming a constant orangish light, and in the center of the 4 lights was one flashing yellow or white light.   Being familiar with air traffic lights and landing lights, etc, I knew these were not normal lights nor was their positioning.  And, because I know where our airport is located and the directions of our runway, I knew this was not a craft that had just taken off, nor was it coming in for landing while making its descent. The movement of the craft was, as I said, effortlessly graceful.   When we first spotted it, it was going at a slow constant rate and staying at about the same altitude for probably a full 10 seconds, but then gained altitude very quickly going northbound and within seconds, was noticeably very far from us.",2011-05-02T00:00:00,36.8952,-121.2434

We watched in amazment, discounting that It could be a Plane or Helichopter and we could even just notice the mountain ranges in the skyline and these lights were far to high to be a tower etc. When we realised that this was out of the ordinary, I  ran for my digital camera which was over my saddle horn as I had been videoing the event at the showground right before this.  This would have been 50m there and back.  I turned my camera on and went on to record what was happening. These strange lights had moved around since we had first noticed them there was around 6 of them. I was dissapointed as I thought the camera was not picking any of this up as I looked through at the sky, so after recording for 36sec, which seemed like forever I gave up and turned it off and just watched with amazment.  Still they seemed to be only moving slowly now back and forth but a couple or so always seemed to be closer, bigger or brighter. They were differant colours, some starlike coloured, some more orange etc.  The stars where not near these lights and the lights were larger also, it was clear in  the south where the lights were but about an hour or so before it had been lightly clouded with slight sprinkling of rain in the north.  I am assuming the moon would have been to the north at this time I dont remember. We had a presantation to attend and so we had to walk away and that was that.  We diddnt tell anyone there except my son's friend who also watched, we were camped pretty much away from the others and as we diddnt think we had captured footage diddn't think much more till we got home and I loaded images and videos off my camera to my computer. I was shocked that I had actually captured some on camera, I was very excited about this and on pausing the video at differant times we were completly amazed at the detail. I have the original still on my digital camera I diddnt want to delete it untill I speak with someone,  But I managed to work out how to capture photos from the video and was even more convinced. On leaving that town early the next day I saw no tower or anything else it may have been. I would realy like to speak to someone and have the footage analized and anything that may be explainable ruled out. Thank you for you time and I will awate your reply as soon as possible as I will have to delete the footage off my camera soon.  I will send these images via email.

I was at my granddaughter’s softball game and happened to glance up at a dark cloud above and slightly west of me.  I saw an object which at first I thought was a high flying eagle but I saw immediately that the object was stationary and not changing shape.  It was dark colored and I would describe the shape as a boomerang with squared off tips. I was about to draw my wife and daughter’s attention to the object when it started to move and appeared to dive.  After a second or so I realized it was not diving but moving away to the west at an incredible rate of acceleration.  It stayed below the cloud level as I could see it until it disappeared behind the golf course tree line to the west of the ballpark.  All of this occurred in less then ten seconds.

I have never seen anything, with the possible exception of an air to air missile, accelerate at the rate this object did.  If I was going to guess at the rate of acceleration I would say this object went from stationary to well over mach 1 in about 3 seconds.  I would estimate that from the time the object started to move until it was out of my sight was less then 5 seconds.   The object made absolutely no noise and there was no sonic boom.

I am not sure of the exact time, it may have been at about 9:15ish that one of my friends saw a small red light that looked like it was slowly descending toward the water, then it disappeared.  I did not see that one. It did not last long.  She thought it was odd, but probably explainable. About 10-15 minutes later, all four of us saw one large bright red light suddenly appear under the moon, due east over the water about halfway between the moon and the horizon right under the moon.  I'm estimating the moon to have risen to about 30 degrees above the horizon.   Then about 2-3 seconds later another large red light appeared beside and to the left of the first light.  It was the exact same size and intensity of light.  They both stayed in the same spot without changing in size, intensity or location for about 8-10 seconds, then instantly disappeared.

The last of the 10 was slow, I was looking through binoculars at them and I was able to follow them but the last one shot across the sky at a great speed. The last one just disappeared and was gone. Witness #2 17 year old male At approximately 11:30 my dad called me to come and look at something outside and I came outside to see 10+ orange lights slowly moving across the sky. They all looked to be maintaining the same speed except the last one. It looked like it had fallen behind, but just as I pointed to it, my brother and I witnessed it move at a tremendous speed to catch up with the rest across the sky. Once it caught up, the first one dimmed out followed by the second, then third, until the last one finally dimmed out with a heading of South-Southwest. Witness #3 Father of above I am a Certified Flight Instructor/ATP with 16,000 hours TT.  I have flown in the Chicago area out of Midway Airport as a pilot from 1974 thru 2001.  Subsequent to that I have flown out a flying community airport Brookeridge (LL22).  This observation was seen looking East thru South  from our back yard in Darien, IL (Darien is in approx 20 miles SW of downtown Chicago).  What I saw was amber light after amber light which seemed to be rising from a point east of us.  I would say initially these light appeared about 15 miles East/South East of us.  All told there were 10+ lights.  They all seemed to climb to the same basic altitude and they followed each other on the same course that appeared to be a heading of 200 degrees.  They were not exactly the same distance from one another, but were all in a line at varying altitudes and basically looked like one was following the other.  They also appeared to slowly gain additional altitude and seemed to travel at the speed of a singl! e engine airplane.  When they were more south of our position they appeared to take a slight course correction to the left….say more of a heading of 170 degrees.  They appeared to stay the same brightness the entire time we saw them.  Ultimately they dimmed in brightness and disappeared.  They appeared to be 5 times the size of a planet you might see with your naked eye.  My sons said they saw one of the last ones lag behind and then accelerate to catch up to the group….however I did not see that.  Both of my sons reacted at exactly the same time when this happened.  I was trying to video tape them and did not see this happen.  The video tape results were very poor and I only got several frames of the objects, but in my opinion my recording is of little use.   I did check with flight service station at the time.  I checked surface winds for MDW, LOT and JOT.  The briefer told me almost every station reported calm surface winds.  Winds aloft for 3 6 and 9 were 340 at 12, 310! at 16, 300 at 33.  In my opinion theses objects were not bein! g carrie d by those winds, their course seemed to be 90 degrees to the  winds aloft forecast.  Surface temp was 9 degree F.  These 10+ objects looked like pyrotechnic devices to me….but 10+ pyrotechnic devices leaving a metropolitan area on a course 90 degrees to the prevailing winds aloft??",2011-01-31T00:00:00,41.7401,-87.988

There is a nearby municipal airport and so such a light might easily be overlooked.  As I watched the light for 30 or 40 seconds(it was flashing an intense array of red, green, white, silvery, and blue) it eventually dimmed over the course of about 3 seconds and began to flash just reddish-yellow, and after another 2 or 3 seconds began to move at a steady pace towards what I assume to be the south or southwest of its position, eventually disappearing behind a far hill in the distance in Westchester County, New York State.  I have observed many such lights over the years, always in the west over the hills of Westchester and Putnum counties and always with a similar pattern.  The lights will always be completely stationary and intensely flashing man! y colors, then either blink out of existence abruptly or after glowing just one color(usually red), or over the course of perhaps half a second the light will suddenly zoom off and disappear in a short arc in the shape of a parabola (like x squared from the origin to like x=4, that shape) and I stress they are always relatively low over the western hills where someone that isn't watching could easily overlook.

I was driving south on 2nd Avenue in Manhattan from 128th Street, when a strange flickering orange light appeared in the southern sky, heading eastbound.  Flickering like the flame of a candle or a star, not like a plane's lights.  My only guess at the time would have been a blimp, but a blimp unlike any I've ever seen.  Also, it was more spherical than blimp-like. Soon other identical lights came into view, passing from behind tall buildings on the west side of 2nd Avenue.  I pulled onto the next street I could, 119th Street, and immediately hopped out and started filming on my cell phone.  Total I would say there were 7 lights that were in the sky, but I was only able to capture 4 on my phone.  Three seemed to fly together in a pyramid formation before the 4th came flying into view.  They didn't fly in consistent patterns either, sometimes changing directions distinctly.  At the end of this experience, which lasted about 4 or 5 minutes, each light seemed to climb higher into the clouds until they were no longer visible. If they were balloons, they were definitely producing light and massive in size.  I didn't see any smoke trails or quick, random movements to make me think they were flairs.  The flight patterns, while they did change directions, didn't alter in velocity, from my point of view.

I was standing on my apartment building roof smoking at night when I spotted a bright blue light moving erratically in the sky above the South San Francisco area (I think).  It was hard to pinpoint its exact location as the fog was steadily increasing and gradually obstructing my view, but it was located not too far from the coast.  If I had to guess, I’d say it was flying/hovering about 200-400 feet from the ground.  Since it was hard to tell where the light/orb was coming from, it was hard to judge its speed as it moved from side to side and up and down in a somewhat erratic fashion.  It didn’t seem to be moving at a tremendous speed, but if it was indeed above South San Francisco, I’d guess it was moving at varied speeds, crossing a mile or two in about 5-10 seconds (again, very difficult to judge).   It would move one direction, slow down, and move the other direction in no apparent pattern, sometimes gaining some altitude, sometimes descending.  There was never a sudden jolt in speed.  There didn’t seem to be any other lights and I didn’t notice a spotlight coming from it.  I’m not aviation expert, but it didn’t seem to behave like a helicopter.  I watched it for about 5 minutes then it seemed to descend and disappear.  I went back inside and looked out my window with the same viewpoint and about 10 minutes later saw it emerge again.  I then went back out on my roof and watched it for another 5 minutes until the fog became heavy enough to completely block my view of it.  I don’t believe it was blinking, but its luminosity seemed to vary - but I attributed this to the fog.  Very weird.",2011-01-31T00:00:00,37.65350353982301,-122.42187345132744

The best I can describe the noise is like a fluctuating “woor...woor....woor...woor...woor”  At first we thought it was a car with a loud speaker system but the noise got so loud that it shook the walls and windows of the apartment complex and it caused the alarm systems in the cars in the  huge parking lot to go off. After the noise reached its peak it got faint within 2 minutes and then it was gone. Our next theory was that it might have been a train but that was unlikely as the train passed by an hour after we heard the loud noise and I have never heard a train sound like that. We also thought of a low flying plane but we have never experienced that before in the 4 years we have lived at our apartment and in all the years prior to that when I lived under a flight path right by LAX .

It was approximately 9:30pm PDST. The night sky was clear with no mist, fog or clouds anywhere in sight. The seas were calm. Our position which I checked via GPS after the incident and then factored in the time and distance traveled subsequently was about Longitude -128.38.26 W, Latitude 51.02.23 N.  Our stateroom was an outside cabin on the port side towards the bow of the ship.  We went out on the balcony to view the stars and the water.  No moon was visible and the staterooms to either side of us had no outer lights on so visibility was excellent.  According to the ship’s GPS broadcasts over the stateroom TV the ship was traveling at 22 knots with a compass bearing of about 338 degrees.  Ahead of the ship and about 10 - 20 degrees off her port bow and above us, I noticed a bright light heading in a straight line along the side of the ship at about 11 o’clock.  It was! coming directly towards the ship but on a parallel, not an intercept course.  The light was far brighter than any star, and much brighter than Venus on a clear night.  It was also more of a dingy, yellowish white rather than the white or bluish light of stars and planets. There was no flicker to it nor was there any changing of color.  I directed my wife’s attention to the object and noted that it was approaching the ship but only very slowly; far less than the speed at which an approaching aircraft would have been moving.  We both looked for any sign of flashing strobes or of the standard red/green lights lights on conventional aircraft but there were none.  If I had held a new pencil out at arms’ length the eraser would have just been big enough to cover the object, but just barely so.  The object passed above and along the length of the ship and passed by our position over a period lasting about 5 minutes.  Both my wife and I continued to look carefully for any signs of a strobe or navigation lights but there were none, not when it was in front of the ship, not when it was directly perpendicular to our position and not after it had passed us by. We also listened closely for any sounds of engines.  There were none. As the seas were very calm and any wind consisted mainly of that generated by our ship’s own forward motion, ambient noise levels were negligible.  We would easily have been able to hear a plane or helicopter engine.  Since there was no cloud cover at all we had no way to accurately determine the object’s altitude.  I think it was probably no less than 1000 feet and probably no more than 3000, but that’s a very subject estimation.  The object did not block out light as it went by any stars, so we could not verify that there was any darker, bulkier object associated with the light.   After about 5 minutes the object simply faded from view over the course of less than 10 seconds.  One moment it was very bright, then next it was fading, fading, fading, gone.  As it faded out there was no deviation in any direction from its original course.  We looked carefully to see if there might have been some very nebulous, low-lying clouds it might have moved behind, but we could still clearly see stars in the same area the object had disappeared in.  They were not obscured by any clouds. The object simply disappeared.   My wife and I stood discussing what we had just seen and kicking around all of the possibilities. We were confident it had not been an aircraft in any conventional sense.  It was completely silent and had none of the normal running lights required. We considered whether or not it could have been some sort of balloon.  The fact that we were approaching it at 22 knots and yet it took about 5 minutes to travel such a short distance to get past us suggested it may have been moving in the same direction our ship was traveling only at a slower speed so that we were slowly catching up to, and passing it. Still, we thought, if we had grossly misjudged its altitude, perhaps there was a remote chance it was some type of balloon and the slowness of its approach had been due to extreme altitude. We discussed what we had seen for about another 5 minutes when all of the sudden the object reappeared in its full brightness at about the same position relative to the ship that it had vanished at.  This time it kept exact pace with the ship and fell no further behind.  It was, however, now moving very slowly on an intercept course perpendicular to the ship.  It took about 2 minutes to traverse a distance roughly equal to the length of my thumb held out at arms’ length at which point its course curved around towards the north and continued on around to the west, then curved back all the way around again to head to the east, and towards the ship, the whole maneuver describing something like a big letter S in the night sky.  Both my wife and I noted this course change at the same time.  It was not a trick of the eyes.  It was clear and unambiguous.  There was still no sound and still no standard aircraft lights of any kind associated with it. Once again it began to fade from view, only this time the fade was slower.  It took nearly a full minute for the object to fade to the brightness of a very dim star but it was clearly visible the whole time.  Once it had reached this level of brightness it continued to move towards the ship for another 2 to 3 minutes, fairly slowly, and visible at all times.  When it had traveled perhaps twice the distance of my thumb again, it disappeared entirely and did not return.  We waited for several more minutes on the balcony to see if it would reappear.  When it did not, we headed inside. It seemed highly unlikely that any type of balloon would have drifted at high altitude past the ship then held position and followed the ship while executing first a 90 degree turn so as to head towards the Pearl, then a letter S type maneuver, only to head back towards the ship again while keeping pace with it. So we ruled out the balloon hypothesis.  There were no clouds any earth-bound light could have been reflecting on.  Chinese lanterns and satellites don't perform varied aerial maneuvers.  Planes make noise and could never have traveled so slowly, and helicopters make even more noise.  Even ultralights could have been heard, and it is doubtful one could have performed the tight turns this object did and even more doubtful anyone would be foolish enough to be flying one that far out to sea at 9:30 at night playing games with a cruise ship.   We couldn’t come up with any plausible explanations.  The ship never deviated from its course the whole time so were were not being fooled by the motion of the ship causing apparent motion of the object.  There was no sound, no other lights, and no flickering or twinkling of the object’s light. We ruled out all the things we’re sure it was not. We just couldn’t come to any firm conclusion as to what it actually was.",2011-02-18T00:00:00,49.181053980099506,-123.99673656716418

It was a sunny, clear day and the temperature was approximately 50 degrees; winds were calm and humidity levels were average for the time of year. While shooting photos of the cat, my son noticed an object moving across the sky. The object was traveling in a northward direction, its altitude was approximately 300-400 feet, it moved at around 20-30mph and it was maintaining level flight. It was completely silent.  He managed to take six photos of the object before it passed out of sight. He described it as having three lobes with a domed structure in its center.  Each lobe was a different color, or seemed to be and the object morphed into a ""y"" shape as it moved farther away. I asked him if he thought it might be a balloon, but he was absolutely certain that it was not.  The manner in which the object traveled and how it changed shape convinced him that it was a craft of some sort.  He told me he was actually frightened when he first saw it.

I was travelling by car (Mercury Grand Marquis) en route to Yuma, AZ late at night to conduct work at the Yuma Proving Grounds the next day, on I-8 heading westward at ~80mph. Just west of Gila Bend (just past the Pima St west exit on I-8, and just north of Gila Bend Air Force Auxilliary Field, which has one North-South runway only), I first noticed two large lights in the distance, at my 10 oclock, ~30 degrees elevation, likely 5-10 km distant (distance difficult to discern).  At first I thought they may be towers, but as time progressed and I continued travelling, I noticed that the formation maintained perspective relative to my vehicle, and continued to do so throughout the two segments of the event. During the first segment of the event, the lights appeared to be fixed horizontally with respect to each other, and were constant in shape, size, intensity and color (dark yellow, almost orange, plasma-like glow appearance).  There were no beacons, landing lights, nav lights, running lights, or similar usual secondary emmiters observed which are typical for most aircraft observed in US airspace.  The angle separation between the two lights from my perspective was perhaps 5 degrees, and did.   The pair of lights continued to track me in perspective for several minutes.  After several minutes, a third light slowly turned on (time constant of several seconds from dark to full brightness), to the right of the formation of two lights (the geometry of which was still unchanged relative to my moving vehicle).  The third light was perhaps separated by 10 degrees angle from the other two, and slightly less luminant (but similar in color and shape).  It stayed on for ~30 seconds. At this point, I began to reach for my Motorola Droid so I could snap a photo.  When I did this, the lights all went out, so I left the phone alone. Approximately 30 seconds after this (~5 minutes into the event), the two lights came on again, at a similar azimuth relative to myself (my ~10 oclock), but this time much closer in appearance (perhaps 1km distant), and higher in elevation (~45 degrees).  I am still travelling I-8 at this on a roughly constant azimuth of ~260 degrees true at 80 mph.  The relative geometry of the two lights is slightly different, appearing now with a slight slope (~10 degrees) downward from left to right.  The two lights have a distict plasma-like appearance, and I could see what appeared to be a thin almost smoke-like trail above each light, illuminated by the glow.  I thought at this point briefly that they might be flares or incendiary parachute rounds (having seen such rounds shot at Yuma myself), but neither would explain the unchanging perspective and movement over such a duration of time.  Then, the third light turned back on again, this time to the left of the formation of two lights. ! It appeared at one point to rotate about its vertical axis, as the light diminished and was occluded partially by whatever structure was with it, and then became full again.  I could not discern structures on either object (my instinct tells me there were two objects, as opposed to three that three lights might suggest...the two larger lights being member to a single object), as it was a very dark night, and the moon had not yet risen...00:54 rise time, half moon for that date.  I scanned through the FM band on my radio while observing, and found no unusual signal.  The third light eventually went out again (~ 1 minute later), and the two lights remained, and continued to track perspective for several more minutes.  By this time I had probably travelled ~15-20 miles from Gila Bend.  There were no vehicles near me travelling in my direction, but there were other vehicles travelling east bound that would have noticed the phenomonae, if possible to view from their perspective! (probably unlikely though, as the relative angle would be ~4 ! oclock t o an east bound driver). The lights suddenly went out.  I continued to observe in their direction, and noticed in the far distance (not close, 10 – 20km distant) two flashing aircraft beacons (one following the other, moving fast, changing perspective).  They appeared to travel towards me (north), and then turned west-ward and flew back south again, receding into the distance.  This seems to me to have been an attempted (and failed) intercept. After the event concluded, I noticed that the formation had been flying roughly in front of the very bright southern star Canopus, and serves as a good indication of the constant true azimuth of the formation as seen from the I-8 interstate relative to me. Being a pilot myself, this whole event intrigued me very much, as I have never seen anything like it.  I have done a lot of work on many military bases around the country, live near Davis Monthan AFB, and hence have seen a large variety of aircraft and munitions in both night and day.  I have never seen anything like this.  The only possible conventional explanation I can dream up to explain the phenomenae is perhaps two slow flying aircraft (helicopters or light prop aircraft perhaps, that could cruise at 80 – 100 knots) that could hang a flare from their aircraft, turn off all running lights, and fly formation along the interstate for the entire distance, maintaining near perfect perspective to me, with a third aircraft moving relative to the two, dragging a third less intense shorter duration flare.  This seems outlandish.",2011-02-18T00:00:00,32.9929,-112.9084

As I was studying all the stars near Orion’s belt, I saw what looked like a clump of shooting stars at first.   Four circular lights that were bright as stars literally zoomed out of no were into the area of this constellation.   I assumed shooting stars at first but as I watched the lights seemed to rotate to the right, as they did this the fourth light became more like a full circle and less of an ellipse like when it first appeared in the sky.  These lights were not flashing, there was no sound, they were as big as a star in the sky and they moved from the right side of Orion’s belt to the left in literally two seconds.   I derived the idea that this is chevron shaped since one of the lights became more visible, and since it did a quick bank turn following the first rotation it made.  It flew past several other stars in the area incredibly fast before taking off upward and disappearing as fast as it zoomed into the night sky.   The whole incident lasted no more than 20 seconds and a marvelous and mysterious short time that was.  After seeing an airplane in the night sky last night, I compared the speed to what I saw last Friday and can honestly say that the airplane’s speed was nothing compared to the mysterious lights.",2011-02-18T00:00:00,42.4614,-76.0753

The sun had already set. I noticed lights moving strangely behind our neighbours tree(in the southern sky). I asked her if she noticed it too and she said yes. Then, whatever it was, moved upwards and we could see it clearly. Whatever it was had 5 lights. Three yellow lights at the centre, a blue flashing light on one side and a red flashing light on the other. The lights were the same size and the flashing lights flashed out of sync.  The way this thing maneuvered tells me it could not be a manned aircraft.I am a pilot and I know these maneuveres cant be done.  For about 3 minutes it flew up, then shot left at high speed, then right again then shot up. It moved very fast, very erratically. My wife ran into the house to fetch a camera, but by the time she was ready to start filming it had dissapeared behind the treeline again. We stayed outside and it appeared again at about 21h 30, but this time only for a few seconds.  We spent the next 3 hours outside hoping it would return again, but it didnt.  The only logical explanation I have is that someone was flying a R/C aircraft at night, because it moved too fast and changed direction too fast for it to have been manned.  The only problem with this explanation is that there is an airport to the east of my home and flying R/C aircraft in the area is not allowed. This thing also didnt make any sound.",2011-04-03T00:00:00,,

We had all just finished admiring the panoramic view and the various skylines when something drew my eyes back to that part of the sky.

It is hard to decipher where it was exactly in San Diego, as it seemed to be over 10 - 20 miles south / southeast of where we were. Immediately, I told the others and they watched what initially appeared to be a shooting star begin to rise back up in the sky. I found myself saying, ""Wait a minute, that's not supposed to happen.  That's not a shooting star afterall.""   The object was glowing red and green and was hard to identify the shape.  Instead of dissipating into the atmosphere after it fell, it began to move close to the ground next to a few tall buildings (5 - 10 stories in height).  It then moved back up in a jig jagged way.  It went about 5 stories above the taller buildings and then swooped back down near the ground again. We all looked away as we joked at what it could be.  ""Hopefully it's just a very nicely made remote control toy or something.""  But then I realized it had impressively bright lights.

I looked up to the Northeast, near the San Jacinto mountains, and saw what I first thought was a very large flock of birds flying in formation.  I called my daughter and her friend over to watch because it was so unusual. When I saw an airplane fly under this flock, I realized these objects were too high to be birds. They were also far too synchronized.  It was the most bizarre sight I have ever witnessed. I’d say there were at least two dozen of these shiny bird shaped objects.  They would fly briefly to the right, then turn and go to the left, then divide in a mosaic type of pattern.  I commented to the girls that it was like watching a kaleidoscope. They repeated this pattern this for at least five minutes as we stood there, frozen, watching and trying to figure out what exactly we were seeing.  The girls thought balloons, no too shiny and too synchronized.  I thought sky divers, but that would have been quite a show and far too high.  I tried to figure if something was being projected onto the sky, but how could that happen in broad daylight?    After this pattern repeated at least three or four times, they flew southward in a V formation like this:  >  They flew in a southwest direction until they disappeared toward the mountain range.   My daughter actually said, ""Maybe we are imagining this.""   I told her that three people don’t imagine things at the same time. I’m still amazed by what we saw.

Then, I started researching online and saw that others have reported formation-type of silver sphere UFOs.  There have also been numerous reports along the San Jacinto mountain range.

So coming off the freeway, I saw a ""plane"" or what I thought was a plane at first and it was flying in an angle like it was going to land on a runway but it was in the direction of the boulevard.  It was dark and 10:10pm and I saw only lights but I thought this ""plane"" was flying low and going to crash and as we came to the intersection off ramp off the freeway onto Fremont Blvd.  This is a busy boulevard, even at night.   We stopped at the light and I was just going to tell my husband, ""Don't go into the intersection I think that plane is going to crash""...  But just when we stopped at the light, the ""plane, or lights"" suddenly stopped mid air and just hovered about a street light pole height above the street lights.  As I watched it while we were waiting for the light to turn left onto Fremont Blvd, the ""lights or plane"" hovered in the direction of Fremont Blvd South direction as if it were waiting for the light to change as well, almost like they stopped and said ""hey wait, she's got a camera"" and watching our car.   And as it was sitting there all of a sudden, while we were waiting for the light the one light on the right, swung behind the other light and came up on it on it's left and just sat there and when we moved in traffic, both lights started going..  It was weird like they were motorcycles driving in traffic but way up in the air.   Since I didn't know how to use my new camera very well, the camera had a delay on it and only took two pictures before the light changed and my husband drove off.  I kept telling my husband wait, wait, I see a UFO but he thought I was trying to be funny because I always make fun of him because he ! watches all the alien shows and on the most part, don’t believe in any aliens or anything.  He just didn’t believe me and kept driving.   When I got the pictures on the computer to blow it up, you can see a 3rd light behind the two I had seen and didn’t see when it happened.

Beginning at the Seven Springs Recreation site North of Carefree, we traveled North/Northwest on the off highway trails that eventually run into the Bloody Basin Rd trail.  We setup camp at FR44 about 200 yards South of Bloody Basin Rd.   Around 1:30 a member of our party spotted two out of the ordinary round white lights that appeared to be a part of ONE larger craft with a visible (yet dim) tail/trail behind traveling North/Northeast.  It was early morning in Arizona high country, the only thing we could clearly see were the two lights, not the body of the craft.   It is ASSUMPTION that the lights were joined or attached to the same craft as they moved in complete unison and matching speed.  I can only describe the light’s physical layout as those you would see on a plane, one light on each side, almost the same as you'd see on aircraft with a light at the tip of each of the wings.   They maintained a very slow (from our perspective) and steady pace and color across the sky, no noise was heard.   The last minute of visibility the lights appeared to turn orange in color, fading in and out of view almost blinking, and then eventually disappeared out of site behind the Mountain Range.   I recently completed 8 years in the United States Air Force and have never witnessed any flying object in the night sky with these characteristics.

My wife was talking with me and looking towards the east. I turned around towards the west looking in the sky. A bright ""round"" white light was in sight about quarter mile away. It was ""very"" slow moving and low like a Cessna. No sound could be heard and then just faded out like a light blub. The sighting lasted about 5-7 seconds. I tried to show my wife as this happened. When she turned around to looked where I pointed . It was longer visual in sight. She said there’s nothing up there !  I just then laughed, knowing I had witnessed something odd. Strange, as I have seen this type before at night while walking the dog. Thanks again for your interest and time.",2011-06-03T00:00:00,43.89253285714286,-78.94515678571429

(would be bright then go out)...then return to its position. the person sitting next to me witnessed the same movement for verification. another coincidental weird factor was the thunder lightening and showers that followed twenty minutes later. the skies were crystal clear ...the storm rolled in ...thundered and lightening ...rained then went away like nothing ever happened. i think the storm might be a coincidence just due to the fact that the entire sighting was so overwhelming? but we saw an orange ball of light. we saw our first Unidentified Flying Object. the next day there was a millitary huey helicopter that flew around for a couple hours as well. again that could have been a coincidence...but i think the nearest military helo pad is about an hour away?,2010-08-24T00:00:00,40.7438,-122.9362

I was taking pictures when my girlfriend got my attention... at first she thought she saw a police car, but the red and blue lights didn't flash.  Once the object floated way above any bridge in downtown she knew it was no car.  Thats when she called for me.  I looked at where she was pointing, and instantly knew it was something I had never seen before!  So I pointed my camera and pressed record, but my camera was still set on photo.  So I snapped a quick blurred picture of it before I switched it to video.  I think I got some good footage of the orb floating up, down, and all around until it flickers away into nothing. I still have the raw footage on my camera as evidence to it not being altered with special effects.  I have a simple little digital camera, which would be impossible to add special effects to video on it. The light seemed to be solid blue on one side and solid red on the other.  You can see this as the object moves from side to side.  During the filming I was so excited, I wanted more footage! I am going back tonight 08/16/2010 hoping to see it again.  I most likely wont, but you never know!   My girlfriend and I feel so special to be able to have seen what we did!  We have always believed that we are not alone in the universe, and now we know!

Two of my friends and I had just arrived outside my friends apt. complex. We were waiting for one of my friends to get out of the car. while we were watching him take forever to get out, i noticed a very bright pulsating light in the sky directly lined up with his car just miles in the distance.(i'd say it was over the delta near travis air force base)Due North. One of my friends thought it was a planet the other thought it was a star going supernova. i'm well versed in my astronomy and told them that there was no star or planet in that direction (due North), especially none that bright. We watched as it sat completely still, hanging in the sky for about 5 mins when two men got out of their car and were going into the apt. complex; so we stopped them and asked them if they thought that it looked like a helicopter. they said,""hell no! that's a UfO."" they watched it with us for about one minute and went inside. it was still stationary at this time and still very bright and pulsing. At that time two of our friends came out of the complex because one was getting a ride and the other was walking her out. As soon as they saw it one of the girls said that's a UFO, we didnt even tell her what we thought it was. The other girl saw it and ran into the house because she was afraid. The girl got her ride and we still sat watching it. The object then started to dim, then brighten, then go even more dim still. as it did this it moved slightly up, then stopped;slightly left, stopped; and up once more and stopped. The whole time my two other friends were trying to call the people we knew in the apt., but none of there phones were working. We were thinking it was getting bigger for a moment, then i realized it was coming straight toward us. the object moved very slow and was completely silent. when it did reach us, it was 100% lined up with our position, i mean when we looked up it was not to the left or to the right, it was right on top of us! we waited for it to pass a little then ran inside our friends apt. to try and get them to come out to see it. they came out as it was nearly passing the apt. complex's walls. We watched it fly into the distance when it suddenly split into to separate lights with a good amount of distance between the two. we watched it until we couldn't see it any more. The whole experience lasted about 15-16 mins. After the experience was over my two friends that saw it the longest with me, and myself, felt very ill and shaky. After we went back inside we stepped out for a cigarette , this was about five minutes after we went in; we saw a black stealth bomber, running below super sonic, flying in the exact same direction as the UFO. I checked MUFON's website the next day to see if anyone reported it. The stealth bomber was sighted slightly more south than my town, which is the direction it was heading, coming from the north. The object was not reported that night, but for the previous night there was a report of an object moving in the exact same pattern,(up,stop,left,stop,up,stop, and then flew right at them) just about 20 miles North of my town.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,37.98853003802281,-121.7887855513308

By the time I got to the parking lot, the object had flown out of sight behind some hills.  We got in the car to drive a bit in the general direction it went and see if we could spot it again, but we couldn't see due to all the hills in the area.   About five minutes later, we headed to our apartment building.  We went to let the dog use the bathroom and that was when I spotted the object, headed back in the same direction it came from.  It looked like a jet with no wings, and it made no sound. I could not see any markings.  It appeared to be rolling like a barrel as it made its way through the sky.  My boyfriend estimated it to be at 1,000 ft. altitude.  He also saw an antenna on the craft which I did not notice.   We watched it for about a minute until it flew out of sight.

There were fireworks going off all around, so I instantly looked toward the sky when I got outside. The very first thing I noticed was a small orange light traveling fairly slowly moving from east to west. It was going slower than an airplane and was fairly low to the ground. Lower than an airplane would probably be flying. There is plently of air traffic over Anchorage all the time, so I know what I'm talking about and this was definitely not an airplane. I watched the thing very closely, and it was a steady light -- no blinking.  I tried to make out if it was a large craft, but it was too dark and all I could see was the light.  And it was not fireworks either, believe me.  I saw it moving and all of a sudden it made a strange move -- about a 23 degree shift to the right effortlessly.  At that point it looked like it was going to fly almost directly over my head! , so I got excited, but all of a sudden the thing started going straight up in the air. It went straight up to the point where the light was so small, it was about the size of a star. And there were two stars up in the sky and I swear they were moving around, but maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I wear glasses and my vision is not great, especially things from far away. I was squinting as best as I could, and I could still see this light traveling now toward the southwest. It was obviously very high in the sky at that point, and I watched it about another three minutes until it just stopped. At this point it was no longer orange.  It was what I'd call a black or gray light. So you'd think it was something impossible to see, but I could still see it because I had been watching it the whole time. This was the point where I figured it must be a very large object because it was very far away at this point. And it just started falling straight down. It was falling faster ! than it had been moving the whole time. I heard no sound, but ! keep in mind I was near a busy road and there were fireworks going off all over the place. But I made a conscious effort to listen for sound from it, and there was none. I watched it fall for about 30 seconds, and I looked back toward the east for a second and I saw another light. It was the exact same thing flying at the same rate and roughly the same path as the original. I watched this one for about 10 seconds and then I looked back to the southwest for the other one, and I could no longer see it. So I looked back for the new light, and it was gone. I scanned the sky for about another minute, and I could not see either of the two lights, so I went back inside.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,61.18196014109348,-149.84252680776015

At that time it looked like it could have been a plane far in the horizon.  Several minutes later we all saw another light appear (same colour).  Within 30 seconds I had the feeling that we were not seeing regular planes.  I grew up beside an airport and my dad flew his own plane.  What I was seeing did not behave the way two aircraft would have. First, the lights were too big to be strobes, and their colour looked too orange.  Furthermore, the lights looked like they were wavy (not solid point). although this wavy effect could have been atmospheric effect. Second, what struck me as odd was how within a minute, both lights came so close together.  If they were in fact far away and high altitude, their convergent paths would require great speeds.  However, if the lights had been closer to us and lower down, it would have been equally strange for the lower object to ascend the way it did. almost straight up.  Simply put, they were moving too fast and too strangely to be aircraft.  In fact, one of the objects looked like it made a few jerky movements (almost like fast zig zags).   Then, they both faded out.  It was hard to tell if they went into the clouds or not; I suspect they did. The clouds cleared for a brief period shortly after the sighting (moonlight improved visibility).  It was at that time that we could estimate the cloud cover that had previously been over the sighting; I’d say at least 7000 feet.

I’m an amateur astronomer and I often look up at the sky, and I did so as I left my building. Almost directly overhead I saw perhaps 6 to 8 hazy and indistinct lights— that’s the only way I can describe them. The lights were in a roughly cruciform shape, but just roughly.  The lights at the “ends” of the longer axis would brighten occasionally, then dim again, but in all instances the two end lights were brighter than the other lights of the shape. The color of the lights was a grayish white, never varying. The shape was, as I say, almost directly at my zenith, somewhat to the west of an imaginary line drawn between Castor and Pollux at the north end and Betelgeuse at the south. I was confused, because I knew the sky was supposed to be clear lasnight (I’d just checked it on the New York Clear Sky Chart, http://cleardarksky.com//c/NYCNYkey.html, as I often do). And indeed I saw numerous stars in the sky, including just around the light formation, so the sky did seem to be clear. I looked away, to see if anyone was near to verify what I was seeing, but (surprisingly) no one was. When I looked back, the lights were still there. When I looked away again perhaps 30 seconds later, then back, they had disappeared entirely. A few minutes later I noticed two of the lights once more, for perhaps 30 seconds, then they again faded; they had seemed to move slightly to the west in the time since my initial observation. The only thing I can think that could cause this display would be a set of narrow-beamed lights pointing straight up and reflecting off a cloud layer I could not see. However, if there were any clouds there, they did not cover any of the stars in my field of view. I have to say, though, that it did not ""feel"" like lights reflecting off clouds, to my eyes. It looked more like bright lights shining through a cloud, but as stated there was no cloud layer visible. The only logical explanation is lights reflecting off clouds that I could not see, but I don’t think that’s what it was. Even so, I probably would not have submitted this sighting but for something odd that happened a few years ago and that this event reminded me of. At that time, perhaps five years ago, I was behind my apartment building and I had again looked up; as I recall it was late evening twilight. I saw, again overhead, four bright lights in a square or diamond formation. These were pinpoint sources, and looked like bright stars. As I watched, over the course of perhaps a minute, the lights faded, in unison, and disappeared. I know this may make me sound odd, as if I have a habit of ""seeing things.""  I do not. As an armchair astronomer, I take an active interest in the sky and tend to look at it often.  Thus I’m not surprised that I should have seen these things, which probably have prosaic explanations, but which for the life of me I can’t figure out. I’m a rationalist, a skeptic, and I have to admit I can’t explain these events.",2011-03-10T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

I inititally only saw one because of a tree line so I thought it was just a satellite.  I took a few steps to the side and that's when I saw all three brillant white lights in a perfect triangle formation.  As I was looking due south, they were moving across the sky on a heading of about 030.  I wasn't sure what to make of it at first, one, I've never seen three satellites in such a formation, two, I've never seen a satellite so brillantly bright, let alone three in such a formation.  The lead point on the triangle stopped and the other two lights caught up and also stopped forming a perfect line.  They hovered there for about 30 seconds and then the lights went out completely.  About two seconds after that two, red, chevron shaped craft in near perfect formation entered heading approximately 220.  I was just letting my dog out, I own a C! anon 20D and 40D and obviously, that late at night, simply letting the dog out, I didn't have my camera on me.  I wish I could have gotten a picture for you.  In all my years in aviation I have never seen such a thing.  There was zero commercial, general aviation, or military aircraft around at the time, not a single port or starboard light, no anti-collision lights, just the event that occured.  The wind was light and variable at the time, visibility unlimited, and I did not hear any sound, the altitude they were at had to easily be above 40,000 feet (FL400).  I've seen countless meteors, during the summer, my kids and I lay outside on the grass and watch.  Our favorite is the Perseids showers in August, these two red chevron shaped objects were not meteors.

On Sunday, November 14 at approximately 3:30 p.m. I noticed a slow moving object tracking in a Northern direction.  The object appeared as only a bright light and had a short contrail – but was not behind the craft but below it.  The contrail also appeared to be in bursts at times. I called 911 who then transferred me to the tower at Richmond International Airport.  They said they had no “reports”.  I then went into the house to find a camera to take pictures – batteries were dead.  The craft then started on an Eastward path, stopped, and just hovered for at least three minutes since I contacted the tower once again and the answer was the same.  When I informed him that an aircraft was going in that same general area but lower and if they looked up at 11:00 I’m sure they would see it.. Approximately 5 minutes later, three (3) fighter jets were scrambled to the same area and I also witnessed an AWAC (hopefully right) radar plane but not on the same course of the jets, but also going to that general area. At the same time in the West area aircraft were spotted with regular contrails that were a great deal longer than the contrail coming from this craft. The craft could not be seen to assess the shape – it was basically a light or just very shiny and the sun was just reflecting off of it.  It appeared as almost a “star” kind of twinkling..",2010-11-21T00:00:00,37.558607538635506,-77.50798002261591

When I left my neighborhood, there were already two mini-golden balls of light hovering in the sky. This is pretty normal for me, so I continued on towards the pier. At the pier, I was completely astonished. There were three of the golden balls of light, now. And each time I would look at them directly or held my camera lens up to them, they would move sideways, not blinking. After I began filming them, another light would appear next to the golden ball. This light began to flash and I watched through my camera as it went from golden light, to what looked like some sort of mock-aircraft. This was no aircraft. These balls of light hover for 15, sometimes 30 minutes, until they are ""found out"" and that is when they start moving. Not only that, but other types of UFOs were up in the atmosphere as well. All of them silent. No noise. There are two airports that you can see from the pier. Clearwater/St Pete airport and Tampa International .NONE of these crafts went to either. Most of them blinked irregularly while I filmed them, and I watched as they grew fainter, until I was unable to see them anymore. There are certain regulations when it comes to navigational lights on a plane. I have studied this and I barely saw any planes that night. Everything was silent save for the people on the dock fishing who were completely and utterly oblivious to the whole thing. These are not planes. I know planes have headlights and I know what they look like when they are close-- these were not planes. When I went back to my house to charge my camera(It died while filming. I only need a DV cable to upload the video.)  I saw another one hovering around the trees.  I went back to the pier an hour later and there was nothing in the sky.  NOTHING.

I do this just about every night.  Nothing unusual.  We live in a dark, semi rural area. There was a bright moon and quickly moving clouds at various levels.  I was staring at the clouds as they passed over the moon and between all of this I noticed an odd 'triangular' form moving slowly east.  I kept thinking it was another cloud, however it was not moving as fast as the wind was moving the clouds.  Hard to see as some of the clouds were larger and blocked out the moon. I saw this shape about three or four times between the clouds and siluetted in the moonlight.  I could not figure the size and it did not directly pass in front of the moon. It was 'off to the side'.  Yet the object must have been solid as it blocked out light around it. No noise, no blinking lights, no lights at all. Just this odd black triangular shape, silently moving east.  As I was w! atching it an ""odd feeling"" came over me. I became a bit 'un-nerved' and thought 'this is strange'.  I've been thinking about it for a few days and started looking around the internet for information on unusual objects. I came across your website and thought I would add this event.  It was most pecular and I cannot remember having such an ""odd"" feeling after having seen it.  The 'feeling' has stayed in my mind more than the actual 'object'. So there are two related events, seeing this thing and a feeling I can only describe as 'haunting'.  For want of a beter word.  I never saw anything like it before.  We live near an airport landing approach and planes are loud.  This object had no noise and was higher than any plane (I think) in that I could not see any details.  No wings, or landing gear. Just a shape.  I ws watching it for perhaps four to five minutes? As it was moving slow, not like an aircraft approach.  And moving east toward Mt. Baker.  You can contact me via email.

My testimony:  Today at about 21:45 at the interception of 2450 N 300 W in front of the Lehi city warehouses and municipal building about 200-300 meter behind them and about 700 m ( less than 2000 feet) above in the sky I saw 2 bright red (with a hint of orange) lights. They were separated about 1.5 - 2 of my fists if I would extend my arm and use them as measurement on how far apart they where and they were fixed in place.  I went walking tonight because it was warm enough as I always do when the weather permits.  I was just a few blocks from home crossing the street when all of the sudden I look to my left and I saw two red lights near and above the sky.  At first I thought to myself that they were a couple of new tall antennas caped by the red lights and I thought to myself how fast they were put in place.  I kept walking until I reach the other side of the street and started walking again going south when I notice that someone may have shoot up a firework up in the sky in the direction! of where the “antennas” where but upon looking the trail of light I realize that it was not a firework. Instead for a brief instant (as when someone tries to make sense of something that quite cannot explain) I thought that the trail of white lights must have been white lights installed in the antenna (only one of them) as a warning to aircrafts because they would light up like in a like sequence from the main red light on top to the bottom of what it seem at first as to be a mast. Upon looking closely to the white lights although they seem to be coming down from a cable from the main red light they were more likely now to what it can be describe as white pulses of light coming down in a straight fashion. At a rate of three at a time but later I realize that there was not really a predictable sequence. I realize that I was not looking at antennas either but it was something else.  At first I thought that they could be planes playing war games and throwing flares but the li! ghts where static and not moving while these white lights puls! es were coming down and descending rapidly from the main red light on the right. They may come in three at the time or one or two then three again but not in any order.  I could not deduct a pattern they seem unpredictable. The pulses were rapid and I could tell they were no flares since flares would have been more bright and will descend more slowly.  Some of these light pulses coming down now seem to reach the ground but I am not sure if they did. They almost look like charges of white electricity coming down of the main red object and they somewhat did resemble warning lights. As I say for a moment also seem to be descending from a cable at first but that was until other lights from the sides started coming down at an angle and they also came down from the main red light but going from the sides at an angle of 45 degrees aprox.  I notice that the red lights could not have been planes or helicopters I should have been able to hear if they were either planes or helicopters they wer! e close enough that I knew for a fact that they were noiseless and static on the sky for almost 30- 40 seconds until the entire white light pulses stop. These white lights were coming from the red object on the right and somewhat below the other object.  While the white pulses were coming down the object on the left move higher and almost on top of the other object from where the light pulses descended.  After the white light pulses stop I could perceive now that the red lights started to move higher and toward the north east very, very, slowly almost imperceptible I realized that definitely that was not helicopter or plane. Having lived in an airbase and worked for a helicopter’s company I know that that was not possible. Planes could not have flight as slow as these were moving and helicopters unless that they invented some kind of completely silent propeller they were just too close and they did not make any vibrations or noise. If they would have been flares the color w! ould not have been the pure white light of these pulses and th! ey would have descended slowly as they generally have parachutes and they also would have been much brighter since I have experience flares in the sky illuminating a training field while I trained in combat with the marines.  Chaffing also is more chaotic and disorderly if thrown from a plane what I mean is that the white pulse neither resembled chaffing.   At that moment my skepticism dropped although I was still looking for a logic to this I realize that whatever I was looking at was not “normal” or familiar, I called my brother while still the lights were moving almost imperceptibly slow toward the northeast and while talking to him the red lights they seem to stop and move backwards and for a moment and them came to a complete halt again in the sky.  They lights were not blinking at all but were continuous solid bright.  They could not be more than a mile away now. I put the size of the red light as the brightness of 10 Jupiter’s or like the brightness of a 60 watt light bulb abou! t 300 feet away.   While talking to my brother one of the lights simply vanished while the other remain there but within a minute or so the other red light vanished as well.  I am still looking to an explanation to what I saw and what those white pulsating lights were. Why they were coming down straight from the flying craft in a pulse like manner. I think that I saw two UFO’s tonight and I hate that there was none else in the street to observe what I saw.  I wonder if someone else in Lehi saw what I just experienced.  I wished I could have a camera at the time or someone else to corroborate my testimony.  I know that I saw these two red lights and I know there is not known aircraft in the military that can fly the way these two UFOs flew. I still wonder what the white pulses of light were and if there is some type of mark on the ground or evidence of these light reaching the ground or some type of material or trail left behind that can be found. I wish I would have the way! to get into that complex and investigate.  Regardless this is! my test imony. I know that what I saw is not normal. I now believe that UFO’s are real. I apologized to those that I ridiculed in the past.  If you ridicule me I would not blame you  I was one of you before tonight.",2011-01-31T00:00:00,40.3245,-111.9618

While working outside, I first heard a jet engine far away, and then it got really loud, like it was accelerating, which made me look up to the southwest of where I was standing. I had a very clear open blue sky view of what first looked to me like the Challenger disaster: 2-3 huge white plumes arcing away, bright orange glowing at the tips.  Then, to the north, I saw something else with a steep upward trajectory and a distinct white exhaust trail that had dark spots, like debris falling away.  That made me think I was seeing some sort of rocket, with the spent stages falling away. Then, back to the southwest, coming out of the white cloud that had been created by the first 'explosion', I saw a fighter jet, and then another.  These were light-colored and shaped roughly like paper airplanes, that is triangular.  I would call them 'fighter jets'. They pulled up into a very steep ascent, very close to each other.  I wondered if there had been three and it was a mid-air collision. I watched the two planes veer southward, circling around to the east and then they headed west. The whole event probably took less than two minutes.  This entry is based on the email I sent to the 104th wing of the Nat'l Guard about 30 minutes after the event. I am not a hysteric or a crank, but I am deeply curious about what I saw.  It was very dramatic. I had supposed it was a training mission of some sort, but given the non-response from all the contacts I have tried to make, I'm open to it having been something less benign. I cannot say for sure what the distance was.  It could have been 20 or 50 miles as the crow flies, which would put them somewhere over Ossipee, NH.  The planes were small to my eye, but clearly visible.  They were probably at 15,000-20,000 feet above me when they circled overhead after the event. I'm not much 'into' aviation, although I do travel by plane a fair bit.  Mostly, I'd just like to know what the heck I saw. As an afterthought, I will add that later on, perhaps an hour or so on, a very large white jetliner went over our property.  It was extremely thin in the body and the wings and very long. It flew low compared to most of the commercial jets we see.  I was obviously hyper alert to things in the sky, but I did not recognize it as a standard 737 and it was virtually silent.  This surprised me, given that it really wasn't that high in the sky (I'm guessing < 7500') I wondered if it might be associated with the event and doing some sort of reconnaissance.

I had remembered that earlier I had seen a rainbow, so I looked around in the clouds to see if it was still visible. It was not. Instead, I saw an orb of light moving around.  It seemed about the size of a small or distant plane flying, but it contained itself to a single area and maneuvered too quickly around to be a plane.  The event was occurring just above a line of trees, so I watched to see if it was a kite or something, but then I noticed another circle.  And in another few seconds another and another.  Soon (within 20 seconds of the first sighting) there were 7+ orbs flying around in that area.  None of them were rising from the ground, but gathering together from other parts of the sky.  All of them were flying around each other.  If these were kites, surely the strings would have tangled together and I would have seen them crashing to the ground. They did not. I have been reading different books about UFO's recently (Communion by Streiber, Redfern's Final Events, and a few books by L.A. Marzulli) so I'm not surprised that my first interpretation of the event was ""UFOs.""  But, because the very name indicates ignorance, I kept watching to see whether these orbs would begin showing behavior typical of some explainable object.  They did not. They continued their dance in the sky and I continued to watch them.  I had no other camera on me but my phone camera, which would not have been able to zoom in close enough to capture an image of these orbs.   After 8-9 minutes, I went inside and called for my roommate to ""Come, see this!""  I had hoped for another eye-witness to this event.  I went back outside and turned my attention back to the sky, but to my dismay, all but one had disappeared and just as my roommate stepped back onto the porch, that one flew into the cover of the clouds and could no longer be seen.

I looked up at the sky as I normally do to observe the stars, and just at that moment I saw what I thought was at first a meteorite was glowing red, left a faint trail, and was heading in a southeasterly direction. As the light fizzled out, I then was awestruck when the fizzled out light reappeared as a bright white light  much larger than any star, I’d say about three or four times the size of the planet Venus, and was clear and distinct.  For a split second I thought I saw a green light, which would have been the right side of a craft.  As the light turned full circle and coming toward me, it then banked and that is when it revealed three distinct and bright white lights in the form of a ""V,"" or chevron, with the two lights of the ""V"" facing forward, and the point light trailing (again each light about three or four time the size of Venus.)   No apparent sound was audible from where I was. The craft made a complete circle and seemed to dive.  It was traveling at a speed I would say was perhaps that of a fighter jet doing casual maneuvers, but was way to agile to be a passenger jet, in my opinion.  The object appeared to be over the ocean and I guestimate, about three thousand feet up.  In holding my hand out afterwards I would say the size of the shape of the three-light configuration was about as big as my pinky fingernail at arms length.  The last maneuver was a diving maneuver on the second circle the craft made and then that was it.  I was wearing glasses I use for driving which corrects my vision to 20-40.  The whole even lasted about one minute, when the object fell below my field of view behind some apartments.

Experience: Specialized in conducting EUO’s (examinations under oath), conducting auto theft investigations, fire loss investigations, wrongful death investigations, medical provider fraud, clinic inspections, pharmacy investigations and medical practitioner criminal and compliance investigations. March 28, 2011 On Monday, March 28, 2011, at approximately 12:05am, while traveling on my motorcycle to check up on my mother who resides at 1351 SW 125 Avenue in Century Village of Pembroke Pines, Florida,  the following event started immediately following my arrival just passed the guard gate which faces South on Pembroke Road. As I approached the building where my mother resides I noticed two very bright, large dark red lights almost burgundy in color that were pulsating in the cloudy sky.  At first glance, the size, brightness, shade of red and distance when I first observed the lights compelled me to stop and observe.  In the sky foreground I observed a couple of small planes and a couple of larger possibly commercial aircraft which were easily recognizable because of the shape, wings and green and red colored lights that all aircraft display. In what I determine to be about a ten second interval, I observed the dark red lights separate and I focused my attention on the dark red light! flying toward my direction and I quickly stopped my motorcycle and got off in order to have a better view standing up.  Within a few seconds I noticed that the light went behind a cloud stopped illuminating red and suddenly out of the cloud I observed a dark grayish looking object in the shape of an octagon which quickly peeked through this white cloud.  I then observed that the octagon was not the shape of the object but rather part of the surface features that it exhibited and I watched as this object emerge completely through the cloud and display the shape of a perfect circle with incredible detail at the bottom of this disk. There was a small, broad rimmed circle in the center of the bottom and wedge shaped lines that extended from the center of the smaller rimmed circle towards the outer edges like an evenly divided “pie chart”. To determine the size I could best describe it as being the size of the full Moon or approximately one inch in width at arm length.  Here I ! am standing in shock, looking in disbelief at this incredible ! object t hinking to myself, Is this really happening, is this a real UFO? And instantly I observe it moving smoothly but fast, westward towards the Everglades. Then suddenly it occurs to me to quickly grab my cell phone and photograph it, video record it QUICKLY, and I start to fumble with the cell phone, and I hit video and point it towards the disk but looking through the monitor I don’t see anything, so here I am trying to reset the phone for a still photo and nervously I hit the video record button again and I cancel it and on the third try I manage to reset it to take a still and I do so, then I remember that the camera lens has a zoom function and my second still shot was taken with the zoom maxed out. By the time the second photo was taken I see the UFO traveling out of my line of sight over some nearby trees and I quickly jumped on my bike and started racing after it with hopes that I could situate myself possibly ahead of it or at least near it to take some more still photos! . I observed the UFO flying away quickly so I raced as fast as I could towards US-27/Okeechobee Road trying to get ahead of it but I lost sight of it while maneuvering around traffic on Pines Boulevard so I quickly raced towards State Road I-75 towards Naples, Florida because that was the direction of travel that the UFO appeared to have been heading when my motorcycle motor started to abnormally misfire.  I eventually made it to the toll booth but after looking up at the sky and scanning all around and not seeing anything unusual like strange lights I decided to turn around and head home. Had the motor performed as usual, I would have definitely raced across Alligator Alley all the way to Naples hoping to cross paths with the UFO.  Strangely enough as soon as I started heading back on the bike towards Fort Lauderdale the bike stopped misfiring.  As soon as I arrived home I grabbed a pen and paper and drew what I had seen then documented the time and location of my sighting! .  Next I got on the internet and searched for photos of UFO’s! and nea rly fell out of my chair when I observed a couple of photos that looked identical to the UFO that I observed.   The photo that most resembled the UFO that I encountered is a photo posted by someone named Alex Nolan.  I attempted to contact Alex Nolan and have e-mailed him with my telephone number so I can inquire on where he obtained the photo in question.  Immediately following my arrival home I attempted to contact Perry Airport in Miramar, Fl. and Fort Lauderdale International Airport and left messages for their staff to contact me. I contacted Channel 7 WSVN TV to inquire if anyone reported any strange aerial phenomena but was advised that no reports had been filed. I have waited for thirty four (34) years to experience something like this and it was over in just a matter of a minute, but what I observed was the most astonishing, incredible, mind boggling experience that I have ever experienced.  I have watched documentaries, movies, seen countless photographs and read many stories but nothing could have prepared me for what I saw, a REAL UFO that displayed so much detail and it was flying directly over my head.  At first I could not believe what was actually happening right in front of my eyes. It was so surreal that I was in shock and at the same time mesmerized that I almost forgot to take photos. I ended up fumbling with my cell phone but did manage to get two pictures, one of which you could definitely see the dark grey color and circular shape of the UFO. What I experienced earlier today was indisputably the most fantastic, amazing and mind blowing experience I ever had.  I use to be one of the many who thought, agreed and believe! d that there is no way that we (the human race) cannot possibly be alone.  I consider myself changed for life, for I no longer entertain the thought or agree and believe,  I KNOW WE ARE NOT ALONE, I WITNESSED IT WITH MY OWN TWO EYES.

Quickly, another light (that looked exactly the same) appeared just to the north of it at the same altitude and faded away as well.   After several minutes, more lights appeared simultaneously in the same general vicinity, all displaying the same characteristics.

Just minutes after that, the orange/red lights appeared back out over the water in front of us and were brighter than they had been previously.  They also appeared bigger and then faded completely.

I have seen these lights for a total of about three times, two of which are the exact same lights/craft and motioned the same...two different locations, the first sighting was in Yorkville about three weeks ago where I saw two lights in the sky.  It started with one light, than another from a very far distance moved in a strange arc toward the other later to ""align"", shortly after ""aligning"" one will go out or disappear only to reappear somewhere else.  This happened three weeks ago in Yorkville. Today, 9 June 2011 I have spotted the same exact lights and the ""crafts"" put on the same light show.  The only difference, is that this time I had a witness, my close roommate.   I quickly called them out to view what I had been seeing; to my luck, I was able to show them too my roommate before they disappeared. What I saw tonight exactly:  1)  Two lights of the same luminosity both hovering and stationary but occasionally moving slow from one direction to another. 2)  The colors change from white, yellow or almost a ""burning orange"", it also seems that the colors and light changes, sometimes they look very distant and faint only to out of no where become very bright again. 3)   I saw the lights on 9 June 2011 in North Aurora, however, I saw these same lights three weeks ago outside Yorkville. 4)  Two weeks ago I saw a ""fireball"" craft, almost the exact same craft found in the most recent ""Oswego UFO sighting"", the report can be found easily on google.  (An excerpt from the article:  ""It appeared to be a ball of fire falling toward earth at a 45-degree angle.  Suddenly, he says, the flame extinguished and the trail of smoke changed direction, rising to a 30-degree angle...""

At this point the brighter lights were no longer on just 3 dull lights (white) and one red light which were not blinking.  All the lights though were dull at this point even the red one. Then I rolled my window down and heard nothing.  I could hear cars, people, and one point even crickets but no sounds that something should make just hovering there in the sky.  It then slowly started to turn and the point or tip of the triangle was pointing downward as it rotated.  Then we had to keep moving and it slowly started crossing the houses over school nearby.

The craft would get very dim and then within a few seconds get as bright as a spot light in the night sky.  I even witnessed it lowering down to tree top level and then shoot back up in the sky.   To best describe it I would have to say it looked like the shape of an eye with one really bright side that slowly rotated like it was looking for something in the mountains and hills.

Myself,  my fiancee and my 11 year old daughter were all witnesses.  We first saw a very bright light in the sky, then as we got closer we realized it was a helicopter.  Odd to see it with what looked like search lights on.   A few moments later, we saw a bright, flashing white light in the sky farther ahead of us.   As we got closer, we also could see red and green lights.  The white light was HUGE and flashing intermittently, the green and red ones seemed to remain on..but it seemed as if the object was spinning in the sky. We continued to get closer, and could not figure out what it was.  It wasn't really moving - sort of hovering.  We came upon it, looked directly up at it from my sun roof - and it was nothing we have ever seen before.  Definitely not an airplane or a helicopter, and it seemed to not be moving at all, since we approached it and t! hen it was behind us as we continued to drive.  It was fairly dark out, so it was impossible to detect any shape, color, or size, as we could only see the lights.  They were very bright, and their pattern seemed to indicate the object was squarish or diamond shaped. When we were directly under the object, I slowed down on the highway so we could take a  good look at it, to about 40mph.  It seemed to be about 500-1000 feet above us, but it didn't look very big, so it may have been flying higher than that.  The object did not seem to move - it didn't disappear, we simply drove past it and could still see it in the same position behind us.  We have NO idea what this could have been, and frankly, feel silly reporting it, but would like to know what it may have been, or if others reported it.  Traffic was light but there were many other cars, many breaking as we were, as if they also saw it.",2011-03-23T00:00:00,,

They flew too low to keep track of for longer time than 7-10 minutes. They moved at a uniform speed, without a stop or hitches. The wind was blowing very very hard and not in the same direction as the dots flew. This rules out Chinese lanterns. [Extra info's] There were a few higher trees further behind the dots. And also some trees between the dots and us. This rules out Airplanes. There was no sound either, until a passing airplane that also had blinkers passed right over our house. It came from the opposite direction. There was also a cover of Chemtrails on our atmosphere, so that also rules out things outside of our atmosphere. The distance was approximately 900-1100 metres, as the Stadium (Abe Lenstra) is about that distance removed from my house. I looked up at YouTube and Google and there are more sightings of UFO's today all over the world. All showing something similar.

Trail going right behind it and thought it was cool looking.  This is why I was looking up. I have (knock on wood) great vision. 20/20 – And I saw two objects in the sky near another jet (not the same one that had the chem.  Trail behind the flag but a similar jet that I see in Atlanta all the time).  These crafts seemed very silver – at times the sun reflected off them – and slowly.  They seemed small, but far and very silver.  I knew right away that they were not normal crafts that I see in the air.  They were very very high in the sky.  They hovered like helicopters but didn’t look or move (left, right, up, down) like a helicopter would.  The other point I really want to underscore is they moved tog! ether.  They seemed to keep the same distance from each other and traveled in the same direction – but that direction was not just east or west – more like zig-zag –quite slowly.  I never saw anytime of spinning or jets – they were real still. I watched them as far as I could as they got smaller.  It was something I will remember forever.

First thought they were a flock of birds, because a small Piper Cub or Cessna, which was passing by at probably a few thousand feet under VFR, suddenly revved its engine, which caused me to look up, and then I noticed what appeared to be a flock of birds, directly in it's path, so I mention to my friend, that the Cessna  was probably trying to avoid that flock of birds, but my stated they weren't birds.  So subsequently, I took out my camera, and started to try to zoom in on the objects, but because the sky was bright, was unable to film the entire even, which lasted, approximately, 3 to 5 minutes.

The object was bluish-green and had a glowing intensity to it. It was larger than the half-moon that was present for the whole night. One of us saw it as a C-shape, almost like the curved, solid side was slicing across the sky and the green light filled the “cavity” behind the edge of it. I saw it as a disk with a small space in the front, very similar to the “Millennium Falcon” from the Star Wars films. I saw green-lit patterns on the bottom.

Our stories lined up perfectly and we were a bit doubtful at first. Then after 2-3 minutes of discussion, we heard a sound very similar to that made by a plane breaking the sound barrier.

On New Year’s Eve 12/31/10 at approximately 11:40pm, I was leaving a friend’s party in Fairfax, VA, and as I entered my car which was facing south, I witnessed 6 round red lights flying in a line low above the trees  in a Northbound direction due east of my position.  I’m not sure how far away they were, but the 6 lights flew in no apparent formation in a general northbound direction.  I quickly got out of the car to get a better view, and alerted my friend and his cousin who were sitting on the front porch. Both witnessed the event alongside me.  As the red lights flew, it was apparent that they were changing speeds, and changing positions with each other as they flew.  The event lasted for a full minute, and just as the 6 lights began to become distant, they all suddenly vanished in unison. I understand that on New Year’s eve there is the possibility of fireworks in the sky.  I assure you that these were not fireworks.

When I reached the top of the hill at Racho Bernardo, I saw a small (far away) dark (grey) cloud-like shape suddendly appear on the sky over the San Pascual Mauntains. The dark shapped ""cloud"" changed shaped very quickly and it streched to a funnel-like shape and then back to more rounder shape. a few seconds later it split into three round shapes that started moving left and right slowly and they appear to fade in and out. the round shapes then started moving faster in short, random directions like a pinball getting smaller and larger, and then all three shapes ""flew"" or disapeard from my sight behind the mountain. Seriously????? I even took off my sun glasses to make sure it wasn't anything stuck to them.. I looked away and then back to see if it was only my vision but no it was real. I'd be interested to know if I was the only one who saw this.",2011-03-10T00:00:00,33.13055039787798,-117.02199071618035
Stationary fireball lights on horizon facing Ohare.,Lisle,IL,2011-03-02T16:30:00,fireball,15-20 minutes,"Occurred : 3/2/2011 16:30  (Entered as : 03/02/11 16:30) Reported: 3/2/2011 7:33:32 PM 19:33 Posted: 3/10/2011 Location: Lisle, IL Shape: Fireball Duration:15-20 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80292.html,Stationary fireball lights on horizon facing Ohare. We were commenting on the strange cloud shape in the sky as though three jets went through close together and noticed them.  Looking northeast from our apartment balcony we saw three individual fireball pulsating objects.  They maintained vertical position  close to the horizon for over 10 minutes and then one went out slowly.  The other two remained for about another 5-8 minutes before going out as well.  They were almost amber in color but flickered frequently and were extremely bright. There were normal air traffic patterns with helicopters but this was extremely odd.  We have planes coming overhead all the time and this looked nothing like them whatsoever.,2011-03-10T00:00:00,41.787,-88.0833
3 friends and I all saw balls of white light in the sky.,Chantilly,VA,2011-03-02T16:45:00,light,10 minutes,"Occurred : 3/2/2011 16:45  (Entered as : 3/2/2011 16:45) Reported: 3/3/2011 12:11:55 AM 00:11 Posted: 3/10/2011 Location: Chantilly, VA Shape: Light Duration:10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80301.html,"3 friends and I all saw balls of white light in the sky. 3 friends and I all saw something we cannot explain.  We were all in my backyard I randomly was looking at the sky. I initially saw what I had thought was just a jet gleaming in the sun towards the Northeast.  When I kept it in my sight and focused on it more I realized it was actually a ball of light, similar to a star. It looked as if it were reflecting the sun off and on, being visible one second and then not the next. What threw me off and caused me to point it out to my friends is that it crossed the flight path of a westbound plane (right over the top of the plane.)  It also had no contrail or jet stream. Yet the most spectacular thing, and what really blew my mind, was that the ball of light at one point multiplied into what seemed like a countless number of the same ball all moving together within the same area; as if they were flocking together around the original ball of light. We watched it as it was to the East of us moving Southbound across the sky and it continued to expand and contract into various numbers of balls of light, again all of the same size and moving in the same pattern.  We observed it continue to move south and at one point it stopped above a treeline and one of friends said that it formed a triangle.  It disappeared for a moment and then appeared again at one point above us moving Southwest diagonally across my house. After that we didn't see any more unidentified activity, however we did see a FCPD helicopter fly in the general direction of the balls of light at a rapid pace.  I don't know if the helicopter and what we saw were correlated but the helicopter did seem to be in a hurry.
