From 7:59 to 8:25pm on March 17th, 2009, (please excuse my ignorance in forgetting to reset the time in my camera for DST!) my sons and I saw another UFO in the skies over Long Beach, California.  We were in the backyard of our home taking pictures of whatever might look interesting, as sky-watching is our hobby.  We do it at least 5 days a week to relax after a long day and I've been teaching them the constellations.   I then noticed something that didn't fit what we've come to know as a terrestrial craft, whether a jet, prop or experimental aircraft.  There was an object that was going from the west to the east and there was no red light visible (FAA REG) as with ALL OTHER AIRCRAFT taking off from the airport. Then it started to hover and immediately changed direction and again... did not have the FAA green light on its opposite side. I have almost 60 photos of this sighting... you really must see them all to be able to appreciate what is going on here. From my vantage point of about a mile off of the Pacific coast, this craft was hovering on the southern horizon - probably above the electric company at the corner of Studebaker and 2nd Street/Westminster.  After hovering, the craft would then make 160-180 degree turns going east, then west, then repeating while slowly drifting further south - over the Pacific Ocean - towards the famed ""Redondo Trench"".  This went on, as can be seen in the properties of my photos, for 26 full minutes. At the time of our sighting this time, it was not clear what shape the object actually was until the photos were analyzed upon download to my computer, and even then, it seemed only the lights were visible.  As far as structure and the apparent ""shape-shifting abilities"", this was one spectacular sighting! However it didn't beat the Triangle ""Mothership"" we all saw last November 12th, and I don't think anything else could!  That was reported the same day on UFO NorthWest, if you are interested. Anyway, I took a few ""real-time"" photos of the craft, but didn't want to ""waste"" the pictures and knew the only way to be sure to ""get proof"" was to take timed shots, so - as a result - most of the almost 60 photos I shot were 8 second exposures at a F 2.5 setting with an exposure value at +2.00 (the highest my camera goes) and certainly showing the true colors of the crafts lights and its flight pattern/path.  I used a high-pixel, Sony Cybershot digital camera and did not alter the originals AT ALL! I have kept their integrity to help you to prove or disprove whatever it was that caused more than ten helicopters to be in the air after it disappeared, and caused them to refuel and return to the search for the next 2 hours or so.  The light appeared to be of whitish/yellow color with a bit of red from time to time, and what got my attention was that the lights and colors did not match the FAA regulations with regards to Red on the left and green on the right and white lights that blink 40x per minute.  This thing pulsed and then stayed lit.  Then it blinked white lights fast and then went back to pulsing again only to follow it with another blast of bright, solid light for another thirty to sixty seconds.  From where I was, it looked like a saucer, then looked like 2 doing maneuvers together.  Then it looked like two orbs that were connected somehow, then ""shape-shifting"" into something else... more square-round. I would also like to mention that based on the photos I have taken, I have reason to believe their may have been more than one craft in the sky last night, too.  Several shots seem to show what could be mistaken for stars, but upon closer inspection, can be seen to have the same color coding/ shading as the inital craft and in two of my photos, it looks as if their are 2 saucers of another shape that might even be a couple of boomerangs, but on a timed photo, it is hard to tell. You are the experts and I do hope that my final disclosure to you will help figure out what is happening on our planet! Well, this was absolutely incredible, but did not come close to others I and my family have had and would like to talk with an investigator about. Last night, there were a total of 7 of us and an 8th joined in at the last minute, that witnessed this sighting and the after-effects. Only three of us saw it for the first 20 minutes or so, because I was getting pictures while the boys watched and tried to get neighbors out to see it, too. What else is interesting is that on March 11th, 2009, there was little to no usual traffic going into or out of Long Beach Airport and around 8:18pm, seven military and police/civilian helicopters flew over our house, seeming to be looking for something on the ground. They flew rather slowly, from west to east and then took a more southerly direction when above Seal Beach, moving towards the Huntington Beach Area. Scary thing? I took photos of them, too as soon as I heard them coming and watched them go... and the first shot set off the flash which seemingly caused one of the helicopters to turn on and shine a searchlight on us! I had the kids shut off the lights in and outside of the house, got to my computer and downloaded them as soon as I could - just in case I got something I wasn't supposed to have! I would most certainly like to speak with an investigator, especially since I've had multiple sightings (as has my eldest son) over the last many years and would like to finally share some of them with anyone willing to listen. I am beginning to fear whatever the heck is going on... and there IS something going on. Especially here in Long Beach, California.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,33.79002328838174,-118.17310534232365

As we continued to drive home, I then saw the lights much more clearly. There were four huge circular lights, each light being bigger than that of a streetlight, flashing - then would disappear, then one huge circular light would appear and disappear, then four more huge lights would appear, then disappear…and the cycle of circular flashing lights continued in that pattern: four then one. They continued to flash and move at a steady pace toward the south. My brother-in-law was amazed at what he saw and yelled, ""What is that?"" Neither of us knew for sure what we were seeing.  I had moved slowly down the road observing it, and then stopped completely in the middle of the road to observe this odd and unique sight.  After about one minute it just disappeared out of sight.

The light was so large we were asking each other ""What is that!?"" for we both knew there was no power lines, storm towers, or any form of electricity of that kind for at least 40 miles, and the light was coming from a distance of about 10 miles. The light blinked twice holding the large red illumination for about 3 full seconds each. My spouse said,"" It cant be an airplane"". I replied, ""I know, look how huge it is"". The red light then blinked fast about 3 times before it went out. To the right and left of the bright red light were two bright white lights (one on each side, about as bright as the brightest stars). The lights seemed to be about 10 feet apart; which may have seemed close, but they were such a great distance away, the distance could have been greater. I actually thought they were stars until I noticed them starting to blink rapidly right after the red light went out. The two lights were blinking alternately and then simultaneously before they both began to move in simultaneous motion as if they were connected. (One could form a straight line between the lights to measure how precise the movement was). The lights, moving as if one object, proceeded to what is my left, in the sky, angled itself so that the lights still seem to be connected then the lights faded quickly as if it were just flying into the distant sky at an extremely fast pace.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,,

There was high visibility--light cirrus clouds near the horizon, low-lying but nothing but blue sky above 10,000 feet.  I looked up and saw what I thought was a star.  This took place around lunch-time, between 11:30 and 12:30 roundabouts.  The star was very bright and I thought it was strange because I couldn’t see any other stars.  Then it started to move, very, very slowly west to northeast over the course of the next 7 minutes. I tried not to take my eyes off of it because it was small and clearly above 30,000 feet as I could see some 747s making contrails (short trails due to such clear conditions) below and around the “star”.  It was not using any of the sky-lanes that planes normally use. Occasionally, maybe three minutes in, and then at the five or six-minute mark, it would stop totally for 30 seconds.  It also seemed to have a perfect circlular aura that almost pulsed outwards, only faintly discernible from the object and the blue sky around it.  I was wearing a good pair of sunglasses with polarization so the sky was very blue and the star quite bright against it.  When I took the glasses off the star was still visible but difficult to track. The bizarre thing is that my eyes went right to it, and there was 360 degrees of clear blue sky.  If I hadn’t immediately seen it or known it was there, I could have missed it.  Would have missed it. It was very bright.  Again, I thought it was a star.  That high up, that shape, that type of light.  The weather was perfect – spring time and about 72 degrees.  I wanted to shout to the neighbors to ask “what is that”, but for those 7 minutes the neighborhood was a ghost town. I didn’t take a picture because my phone was inside the house and I knew if I took my eyes off of it I might lose it.  Sure enough, just as it passed directly overhead I glanced away for a second, maybe two, and then it was gone.  Weirdest thing I’ve ever seen.  I work outside and I know the air traffic here.  This was highly unusual.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,35.60140526315789,-77.24022186234818

It was not moving like the ISS and did not streak across the sky like a meteor.   The two distinct pieces slowly drifted apart.

I had drunk a couple of cans a lager and wasn’t sure at first but it seemed to move so slowly, almost hovering across the sky that I knew it was not normal.  It was a very large Ball of Fire. At first I thought it was just a firework due to the fact it was bonfire night, maybe a rocket type but it was moving slowly towards us.  I could see that it was not an aeroplane or a Helicopter because of the speed it was moving. It started in the sky about 2 miles away and within seconds it hovered across our garden approximately 500-600 metres up in the sky, as it passed over head I could see it.  A large clear Orb with a Ball of Fire inside once it got 200 metres away it suddenly shot upwards very quickly and disappeared out of sight within seconds. I knew this was not normal and told family who of course took the Mickey out of me. I have never seen anything like this before and am certainly not the type of person who would normally tell people about this or fill in this form but today is the 10th April 2010 and I and my Wife have just seen exactly the same thing again. My wife did not believe me when I told her in November but she was just with me smoking a cigarette on our balcony in South Ockendon, Essex and she witnessed it with me.  Again it was a large Giant Ball of Fire in the sky approximately a mile away from us and I would say about 500 metres up into the sky.  It was so clear that you could see it was fire and it was hovering slowly from right to left of our view.  It was far too slow to be a plane and had no noise to it.  My wife could not believe what she was seeing and I told her it was what I saw before.  We watched it for maybe 30 seconds and the Orb changed route and shot extremely quick straight up into the sky and out of sight. I am both amazed and confused to what I have seen and still not quite sure how to explain it.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,,

On the evening of August 5th at approximately 19:30 a friend and I were videotaping an approaching storm the lightning was really going off. I often film these storms and go back through my footage to find cool still images of lightning. Today was just another day just another storm...so I thought. Later that evening I uploaded my video and started going through it for my shots. As I Scanned through the video something caught my eye flying across the top right corner of my screen. I watched this thing go by over and over and determined it moved to fast to be a bird or a plane, then I discovered that prior to seeing this object, something appears from a cloud in the middle of the screen and zig zags what appears to be into the distance then it shoots off with incredible speed and you here this sound like a ricochet. I decided I needed to go through this footage and see if I had captured any other activity. First I wanted to see what the thing was that was flying across the screen. I zoomed up on the image and it appears to be several (3-4) oval disc shaped objects flying together. I captured the still images for the evidence file. I started back at the begging of my footage to see if any other activity was present. Almost right away just after my camera was placed I discover 2 more UFOs. Both appeared in different locations on the screen at almost the same time. The first appeared about 100 yards away very quickly flies up from behind a large pine tree across the street and flips then descends and appears to go directly behind my buddies truck which we are positioned in front of. The other UFO appears way up in the clouds and is moving very fast through the clouds. As I scanned my footage further I discover another object moving very fast along the horizon real low. It enters from the right as it reaches the left side of the screen in moves in a very fast circular pattern upwards the disappears into the clouds. Further along in the footage an object is seen on the right side of the screen. It appears to be moving towards us the changes direction sharply and zig zags 2 times then flies quickly into the distance. I zoomed up on this to discover it was 3-4 disc shaped objects flying together. After this a few minutes later into the footage we encounter the first UFOs we talked about. One other strange thing appears. A red light appears on the windshield of my buddies truck. It has no reflection in the glass and is only visible for .02 of a second. When I zoom in and slowed the image down it looks very strange and has a pattern of movement. The Duration of the event less than 6 min 22 sec. My buddy and I saw nothing during the time we were videotaping only afterwards was anything discovered. This concludes my report.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

This object was flashing red, green, blue and orange lights.  Not just dull versions of those colors but the most beautiful vibrant version that you can ever imagine.  Also it wasn’t moving except for the occasional sway from side to side. I had never in my life been in such a state of awe.  My husband ran and got our camera and binoculars.  Of course my camera wouldn’t catch the object but when we looked through the binoculars you could see clearly that it was the most perfect circle ball shape ever.

I noticed a bright double strobe of light in the N-NW sky about 80 degress in altitude. I dismissed it as nothing but kept looking at the ""star"" in which it originated. It double-strobed again. About 2 seconds later, another object about 10 degrees away to the south appeared to give a ""reply"" double-strobe. Both objects were stationary and had a magnitude of about 2.0 when not flashing. Immediately, both objects started slowly moving toward the SE. The lights faded to dark within 10 seconds and I didn't see anything else. The amount of distance covered when both objects faded to dark were not consistent with normal satellites moving into the earth's shadow. This means that the object's light source was not created by the reflection of the sun at that altitude. I assume the altitude was very high since none of the stars in the direct path were eclipsed by the ! object. At the presumed altitude, the objects went from a standstill to the speed of an orbiting satellite in under a second.

At 3:16 to 3:17 AM, I went outside before going to bed, and within a moment I noticed the sky was clear and saw what I thought were airplane lights moving in the sky.  I then noticed there was an oval or ellipse shape formed by what looked to be 5 or more lights moving through the sky.  The size of the lights were like small, not particularly brilliant stars, but bright enough that their movement against a dark clear sky were apparent.  There could have been more than 5 stars but with the small size and distance and movement I was only able to count 5. This movement caught my attention immediately. I saw the movement was slow and steady. I went quickly into the house and shouted to my brother to come immediately.  He came out and also watched the object. The Pleiades were to the south of this object and higher in the sky than the object.  The object moved on a track toward the northeast horizon.  If I were to draw a line to track its trajectory backward, if it had traveled a straight line; then it started west and to the mid heaven side of the Pleiades. There was a notable gut sense the object was very large and quite a distance away, higher in the sky than perhaps one might think.  But, there was no visual reference to verify this sense. We are in Southeast Iowa in a small town of 8000.  If there were no city lights we would have had a better view. We watched to see if any star lights were obscured by its passing over them, but the lights of the object became dimmer as it traveled closer to the horizon was such that we never saw any stars crossed and we lost view of the object before it got low enough in the sky to have its view blocked by the trees. I thought of calling the police to report this, it being so unusual; then decided not to bother as the object had passed.  I reported this sighting to my ex-wife and a friend by email so that I would have a time stamp to record the time; then thought to look on the net to see if other had seen an object like this. So far I have not seen a picture which matches what we saw, but only looked on the net for a couple minutes. We are occasional sky watchers by habit when we go outside on occasion, and have many a time observed satellites on occasion. This was new and different. The low side of the ellipse was on the left, on the north side, rising to the right (south) as in the picture below. No sound was heard. I am 55 and my brother is 49.  We were not under the influence of any drug, but we did have a half beer each about 7 hours earlier, which surely did not cause this strange observation.  Quite interesting.

I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me at first because the car was in motion and I was definitely driving towards the nose of the plane, but as I got closer I realized that it was truly just sitting there parked in the sky.  To its right (my left) was an orb dancing around in the sky.  It seemed to reflect the sky on all its ""sides"" and appeared perfectly round and solid.  It was no bigger than a person would be if they were curled up in a ball.  When I realized that it was indeed parked in the sky, I pulled over and snapped a photo with my digital cell phone camera.  It isn’t that great but I have it if anyone wants to see it, and I will try my best to get it to sharpen in photoshop, but the actual raw photo taken at 9 am on 1-9-09 is in an email I just sent to this site.   The exact location of the craft was approximately ½ mile north of the Toyota plant in Huntsville on Pulaski Pike Rd.  I don’t know why it chose this location because there is only a field full of llamas and alpacas, some donkeys, horses and cows.  There is also a stream near by with fish in it.  Maybe it was surveying the area or something I don’t know.  But after I took the picture I was beside myself.  Back in 2000 when we lived in Texas, the whole family (kids, me, hubby) saw the exact same thing.  A large passenger plane parked in the sky, about the size of a 737 or 747, and it too was parked so low you could see every detail of its wings, engines, windows, paint job.   This one yesterday was painted with a silver grey bottom and orange on the sides (like a Northwestern Airlines plane).  It had no ""underbelly"" rocket boosters or anything, there was no way in the physical world it could have been hovering because passenger planes that are made to stay in flight while moving at 600 miles an hour simply drop to the ground if they are! motionl ess. About 30 seconds after I parked the car, it started to go away (I guess the occupants saw me?)  It went slow for about 5 seconds then disappeared going in an upwards north easterly direction very fast.  Also, the sphere that was dancing around everywhere disappeared.  Oh and the weather for the sighting was perfect, 100% clear sky, no clouds anywhere.  9 am, broad daylight. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she sounded to us to be quite sincere, and quite credible.  We have looked at the photo, taken with a cell telephone, and the objects is reminiscent of a swept-wing airliner.

The flaring occurred in intervals of about two to three minutes and I observed about five of these events.

I returned to my upstairs bedroom on the front side of our house, and resumed watching television. I had my bedside window opened approximately 6, though my shades covered the gap. At 2:05 exactly, my (almost 15 year old) daughter and her friend were in a nearby bedroom talking.  Her bedroom faces the rear of our home.  There are no shades or blinds on her windows.  The girls remarked that there must be a storm coming, as there were flashes visible in the upper edges of the windows, and appeared to emanate from the clouds/fog over the house.  They then realized that the flashes were stationary and occurred in fixed intervals.   As the girls looked more closely out the window, they were looking upward.  They noticed that a large dark shape was moving over our 2 story home toward our backyard (west to east).  The dark shape then dipped downward as it moved over the crest of our home toward our backyard (eastward), and was visible below the cloud/fog level, approximately 30 feet off the ground.  As it moved slowly away, it became clear that it was triangular in shape, and had 3 lights along the back, flashing blue, red and green in varying patterns.  The object emitted a low, pulsing hum noise that was audible from the girl’s window.  There were no loud or airplane/jet noises, or I would have heard them with my window open. I can only surmise that between my tv and my husband’s snoring, I was unable to hear the very low noise. Behind our home is an open field that is used for farming.  It is a large, open area with the nearest houses at least 1/3 a mile away (guessing - not an absolute distance).  There is an old barn within ~200 feet of our home that sits in the southwest corner of the open field.  As the object moved away from our property, it reached the area of the barn and hovered briefly.  It then slowly moved away toward the northeast, and suddenly disappeared.  It appeared to the girls that the object was approximately the width of 2 houses in size. At 2:08am, near the far east edge of the field, 2 similar objects suddenly ""winked on"" and moved around one another for a brief period.  They appeared to be the same types of objects as the one that moved over our home. Just as suddenly as they appeared, they seemed to ""wink off"" and disappear. At 2:10am, a new set of flashes were visible over the house, and they were similar in nature to the first set. As the girls watched, a much larger, and louder (humming) object moved over the crest of our home, following the same path that the first one did.  This one appeared identical in every way, with the exception that it was so large that as it dipped over our home, the edges were not immediately visible.  It had to move beyond the barn for the entire object to be seen. It was easily double or more the size of the first object.  As it moved west to east, it slowed over the field, and then slowly seemed to rotate over a fixed area, and remained there for approximately 3-5 minutes.  It was possible to see strobing lights on all 3 corners of the object, but the 3 lights in color were only visible on the ""back"" edge of the object. As the object sat in place, the 2 objects that had been sighted at 2:08 suddenly lit back up and began to move around, as if in response to the larger object close to our home.  This continued for the last couple of minutes that the large object hovered.  With no warning, all three objects just disappeared. It looked as though the smaller objects streaked away to the left and right of the large one, and that the large object lifted straight up, out of sight. The two girls described their thoughts and feelings as though they were transfixed and unable to really do anything but watch.  They debated whether to wake either myself or my husband, but were concerned that they may not be believed, especially after time had passed and no more objects were visible.  The one thing that they did notice was police sirens in the vicinity (I did hear those), and they wondered if they were in any way responding to the objects. The open field is sort of unusual in that it is sort of ""land-locked.""  It has very busy roads on 2 sides, and has houses and suburbs on all 4 sides.  If you didn’t live next to it, you would not be aware that it is even there.  Considering it’s size, that is really unusual. A very short distance from the field, near the south-eastern corner are at least 3 bar/club businesses and a bowling alley, all of which would have closed at 2am.  If anyone was leaving them (this was a Friday pm/Saturday am time period) they should have been within eyesight of  some or all of the objects.  The only variable that I am uncertain of is the cloud cover/fog placement.  Even when the objects were above the cloud/fog line, the rhythmic strobing was visible. I have repeatedly asked questions of my daughter in different ways to verify details (and to a lesser extent her friend - she had to leave), and the story has remained consistent.  I believe her - and that was before I had a chance to read/learn about all the other sightings near our area.  We are very interested in verification of the sightings, and if anyone else saw anything similar.  PLEASE get back with us if you learn anything, or we can do more. [Please Note - Though we don’t want it posted publicly, entering our address into Google Maps will show you the field in relation to our home.  In the lower left corner of the field is the barn and a dark, teardrop-shaped pond.]",2009-01-10T00:00:00,39.47070414507772,-84.42877512953368

It was sometime between 8pm and 10 pm when I went onto the back deck behind my home and noticed a very strange light in the sky. I had seen it the night before in almost the same position at almost the same time.  Last night, it was again in almost the same place.  There are no towers of any sort in that place.  The light seemed to turn colors.  It seemed to change from white to blue to red and green.  It stayed in the same place for at least 45 minutes.

When I zoomed in with my camera the light seemed to have a haze about it and it appeared to wiggle, although my hands were very steady. It appeared to be changing shape or size.  It was very difficult to see considering I was only using a camera. While taping the object, I noticed at least 3 other lights, perhaps up to 10 or more, going across the sky.  I cannot say for sure what those other lights were.  They appeared to be much smaller in size and white in color.  They appeared out of nowhere and would sometimes fly past the main light or in other directions in the sky.  They would fly very quickly by and then disappear or fly out of sight.  They blinked.  At one point, I saw a light fly across the sky that was bright orange.  It also blinked.  Later, I saw another light fly across the sky flashing red and white lights.

I then looked up this site on the internet and spoke to Mr. Peter Davenport which encouraged me to make a report because so many sightings go unreported. I felt strongly enough about what we had seen, and felt compelled to share this information in hopes that someone else saw the same thing that we had seen. We are all certain it was not a plane!",2009-06-09T00:00:00,33.1756,-96.3441

I have filed a report before regarding lights in the sky behind my house.  Last night I once again saw something strange by my house.  I was watching the sky from my back deck, looking for the lights that I saw on previous nights, when something red caught the corner of my eye.  I turned to my right towards a large tree that sits beside my house.  I saw the strangest thing I have ever seen in my life.  I watched a craft or light of some sort about the size of a kitchen table or slightly larger appear from just over the top of the tree.  It was not very large and I could not make out the shape of it as it was dark.  It looked like a circular shape, perhaps. I saw several lights coming off of it.  These lights blinked and were very bright in intensity.  They were red, gold and white with several blinking at the same time. They appeared to blink in almost a triangular fashion.  I noticed mostly the red color.  The craft drifted at a medium pace across the sky over me from the tree to my right towards another tree to my left.  Then, it disappeared from my view behind the tree.  The duration was about 30 seconds in length.  It made no sound whatsoever. I then became scared and ran into the house.  I got my video camera and came back out about 10 minutes later, but the light never came back.  Later, at night, I laid down to go to bed.  It was about midnight according to the clock.  I closed my eyes for a few minutes and then heard my son cry out, which is common.  I thought that I had just laid down and I was agitated that I had to get up right when I had gotten comfortable.  I sat up and looked at the clock.  Approximately two hours had passed from when I first laid down, only it had felt like only a few minutes to me.  The clock read that it was sometime after two in the morning!  I really do not feel that I fell asleep during that time and feel that I am missing about two hours of time.  I can not say for sure, though.  When I opened my eyes once I heard my son cry, my body hurt all over.  I! thought to myself that it was strange, that I felt as if I had been hit by a truck.  My entire body was very sore.  Today my shoulders hurt, but that may be due to the weather changes.  I am not saying that I was abducted during the night, however I sincerely feel that I am missing almost two hours that I cannot account for.  The other lights I have been unsure of what they are, however what I saw last night I am convinced was not of this world.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,39.3585,-79.9984

The place we were meeting at was for me a former work place , but one that my friend still works at during the day; the parking lot of the Santiko Embassy theater located off of Bitters Rd near Hwy 281 in San Antonio TX (this location is about a half a mile or less from the San Antonio airport).  The movies had finished and I believe the only cars left were those of the employees still inside. We were standing at our cars just talking when I turned from facing south to the east, and as I looked at the sky I saw lights; as we are near the airport didn’t think anything of it as I just assumed it was one of many planes that fly in and out all hours of the day.  But within what seemed less than a second the light zigzagged not only up and down, but sideways as well.  My first thought was “what the heck”, second thought “helicopter”, third thought, “hell no they don’t move like that”, then I saw that there was more than one light.  It was partially cloudy and the lights would disappear and appear depending on if they were behind a cloud or not.  Because they did not all disappear and appear around the clouds at the same time it was hard to say if there was more than 4 lights or not.  I was not able to judge the distance or height but it appeared to be higher than the landing or takeoff height of the planes around the area of the airport.  Trying to be logical about what I was seeing I then assumed they were doing something at the airport or at least in the vicinity of the airport, something like floodlights; but to the best of my ability during a cloudy sky flood lights appear to shine off the clouds and of course have a trail of light to lead you to their location, not disappear behind the clouds without once showing a trail of light.  Understand that this all took less than a minute while I was just staring at lights; meanwhile my girlfriend (who was facing north towards me) was still talking.  I then shouted out, “did you see that”, and of course she said “what”.  I pointed up to the area where there was now nothing to see as they appeared to have gone behind the clouds; she again said what when suddenly one then 3 or more appeared and were zigzagging all over that one area.  I again asked if she “saw that” and she replied “yes”, and asked her what she thought they were planes or helicopters, she said no way, they don’t move that way or that fast.  We just kept watching them zigzag extremely fas! t in and out of the clouds but always in the same area.  I thought maybe lights from the planes, but that didn’t make sense as they don’t move that fast or zigzag up and down.  We watched for several minutes and talking excitedly about we thought we might be watching and at this time I checked the time and it was 12:48; I believe I first saw the lights at 12:45 and then my friend said “this is just to weird I’m leaving”, by this time I myself was getting scared and said “me too”.  Neither of us had a camera; her cell phone had previously be damaged and the screen would only show black, I had a new phone and don’t know how to use it yet but to be honest didn’t even think about it. Since I only first noticed the lights at 12:45am and stopped watching at 12:55am I have no idea how long they might have actually been visible.  At approximately 12:54 I was driving off, went to hwy 281 and headed north towards hill country where I live 3-4 miles outside the city limits on a bluff overlooking the area both south towards Johnson City and north towards the airport and town.  As soon as I got home I went to the highest point near my home to look at the sky but saw nothing but sky, stars, clouds and the lights from the planes flying overhead.  By this time it was about 1:20 and as I tried to calm down and think of what I should do I went onto my computer and went to white pages where I looked up numbers for the airport and non-emergency Bexar County police.  I got in touch with the airport police and asked them if they were doing anything with lights at the airport which they responded no and asked them if anyone had reported seeing lights.  I explained what I saw and he said no one had called, took my name and we said good night.  At least he asked me my name and thanked me for calling, that he would check around, the Bexar county policewoman who took my call asked me nothing, just listened said no when I asked if anyone else had called then thanks for calling and we hung up.  I’m still excited about what I saw and unless someone can tell me that there was some kind of light show going on at this time of the night on a Monday or anything in the least bit believable, I will always believe I saw UFO’s; but they’d have to be pretty convincing, since as I said there was no normal cloud effects with these lights, just extremely fast zigzagging in and out of them.  This morning I got up with the knowledge that I was going to call someone else and report what I saw so I went on line an entered “UFO Sightings” and got you, next I’m going to enter FAA and see if there is a number I can call.  I’m not crazy and in fact worked for 15 years with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority before retiring early and moving to San Antonio.

Noticing something out of the corner of my eye, I glanced up and saw a dim, flickering light, hovering about 20 degrees above the horizon southwest from my house. It appeared over the Saybrook breakwater, in the direction of Plum Island, but seemed so dim and distant that it looked much farther- maybe even over Montauk or the Atlantic.  I was confused, because it hadn't been there when I last looked, less than a minute ago, so it couldn't be a star.  But it didn't appear to be moving, so it couldn't be a plane.  As I watched it, I thought it might be a plane heading towards me. It appeared to move slightly up and to my left (further north from my perspective) and then faded away.  I didn't see it again.

It seemed cautiously defensive in its movement. Then to my amazement i saw 8 ""stars"" in the distance, i say stars, it soon became apparent they were not stars as they began to criss-cross each other in a zig-zag manner across the nights sky, jolting from one corner to another with tremendous speed. There was also another object opposite to the centre of the activity glowing/flashing slowly, almost like a beacon to the main 8 objects. Dancing around the night-sky like fireflys, there was then what seemed to be an eagle-shaped golden-glowing object which swooped downwards and then shot-off into the hemisphere with all the other objects zipping off immediately in unison. The golden object almost looked like a gold-man with wings, this sounds really strange but it's what i saw! In my opinion the helicopter was either monitoring or warding away the foreign-objects, it circled for around ten minutes until the craft had disappeared and then left soon-after. As a life-long sceptic, i have never seen anything like this at all before and the experience left me jaw-droppingly panicked!

As I continued driving and watching this object it did seem to be relatively low in the sky (3,000 to 4,000 feet up) and I could begin to make out 2 mid sized red flashing lights (each light was flashing separate of one another fairly quickly).   At this point the object slightly changed direction to begin heading Northwest.   As the object was picking up speed it seemed to be about 1/2 mile in front of me as it crossed over I-12 at the Lacombe/St. Tammany exit which is about 3 to 4 miles from the original exit that I first saw it at.  At this time I could clearly see that inbetween the 2 midsized red lights were at least 4 white strobing lights smaller than those red lights but I still could! n't see a shape to the object.  Almost underneath where the object was there were 4 vehicles traveling west, I was roughly 3 to 4 blocks in back of these vehicles.

It flew as fast as would a normal plane (which makes me think it may have actually just been a plane) and it had two or three blinking lights on it, one red and two blue.  Though I was the only person who saw it at least twenty people, including myself, heard an odd noise before and after the object was within sight (note: the sound was not heard while the object was in sight).  The sound was very similar to soft thunder (even though the sky was clear).  Some people thought it may have been fireworks, but the soound was too continuous to be from fireworks.  I even speculated that it could have been sheets and cloth flapping in the wind, for it did sound like that just stronger and farther away.  Was this an extra-terrestrial phenomenon, I'm still skeptical.

UFO Sighting on Sunday,  APRIL  5, 2009 by a Male Observer   Dear National UFO Reporting Center,  Earyl sunday morning, April 5, 2009, at around 2:45 AM in the morning, my girlfriend and I both saw a UFO at the same time. We both saw it from inside of our car. We were driving back home to Montgomery County in Maryland from Howard County in Maryland on Route 108. We were driving from the east to the west, specifically from the northeast to the southwest, more or less. SEE MAP: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Route_108    I believe we were still in Howard county around the town of Clarksville - or Highland - when we saw the UFO on the right side of our car - the passenger side. It was not very far away from us, as there were some tall power lines - or a cell tower of some kind - off the road in the field to the distance from us on the right of our car and a bit ahead of us as we travelled toward / by it on the left. It's hard to tell if it was one tower or a series of power line towers - but I will look more closely the next time we drive by and see what it actually is - and exactly where it is in relation to the road (Route 108). The UFO was moving toward the tower - and then STOPPED! It stopped by the tower right after we both noticed it up in the sky. It was NOT very far away from us. My girlfriend asked, ""What is THAT?!"" ... I saw it, too, at the same time and also said, ""Yeah, what IS that?!"" ... ""It's not a plane, I can tell you that."" she added, as she rolled down the window to try to hear any sounds coming from it. I slowed down the car. Neither of us heard anything at all. Then I said, ""It's not a helicopter, either, because I can't hear anything - and that's too big to be a helicopter - and planes don't just STOP like that.""  It had red and green lights that were slowly going on and off. The lights were the first things we both noticed before seeing the object itself. It appeared horizontally long, like a mettalic cigar in the sky by the tower. Then my girlfriend said, ""I have a creepy feeling. We should speed up. Whatever that is, I have never seen anything do that before.""  So, I sped up, and as I did so, the object began to move again and was heading in OUR direction. My girlfriend said, ""It's coming this way, toward the road. ... GO!""  So I went even faster, and she took her seatbelt off to look at it pass over the car and off behind us in the direction of the area behind my side of the car - back from the area of Howard county where we were coming from, back in the northeast direction sort of. She looked at it as it sped off quickly, and the lights disapperared - and then the object itself disappeared. There was no sound of a helicopter or an airplane going over us from up above as you would normally hear. Then it was gone - and we continued to drive back home. What WAS that?!  Do you know?  Has anyone else reported seeing such a thing on that evening?  Thank you very much!  I left a message on your answering machine today.

My friend and I were star gazing at around 4:30 am about 9 miles outside the town of Paw Paw, West Virginia. The night sky is unlike anywhere else I have ever seen up there because we were so far away from lights. I noticed a point of light, which at first just looked like another star (a relatively bright one) moving across the sky from right to left. When I looked closer I could see that the object wasn’t exactly round like a star but rather kind of elongated, like an oval or very short cylinder. Think of it this way: I will compare a normal star that is circular in shape to a BB (like a BB Gun BB), but smaller, and this object was similar to a grain of rice. The overall size difference wasn’t great but I could definitely tell that this thing had a long side and a short side, although it was very minute. After seeing this thing moving I got my friend to look at it too. He saw it moving and said how unusual it looked. After about 10 or 15 seconds the object got much brighter instantly and within a few seconds disappeared completely. This was not a shooting star because it was going much slower than that. I think it could be a satellite because I have read that they have been seen to brighten when they hit a certain sun angle and can also disappear when sunlight is no longer reflecting from them. However, it seemed like once we started talking to each other about how odd this thing was an what it could be, that’s when it got very bright and then disappeared like it knew that we were aware of it. I wonder if anyone else has had this kind of sighting. I would like to know more about what we witnessed.",2009-04-14T00:00:00,39.4602,-78.4492

I had just cycled past the Redstone Industrial Estate, gone down a little bicycle path which goes beneath Spalding Road and was just lifting my bike over the Somerfield supermarket fence to cross the carpark(to shave a minute or two off my time)and I saw a black triangle over the docks, about 1/4 mile away. I first thought that it was a helicopeter, this was because it looked to be too small to be a plane and was moving too slowly. I soon began to doubt this because I was not aware of any noise coming from it. It moved slowly, not much faster than jogging pace. It was also not too far from the ground either. The triangle was near a 6 storey office block on the dock, and was only 30 feet higher than that. I put my bike down, and started to walk towards some moorings, on the opposite side of the river from the triangle. I had only taken a few steps and then it just shot into the sky and over my head it went. It was quite a sight.

This is a very commonly flown zone for passenger aircraft each half hour and then some. There is a small craft airport in Fishers, less than 2 miles from the area and this craft came from the uppermost part of the clouds, without wings DOWN and no noise, and no flapping as a bird. Neither was it the same as fighter jets with wide wings. It clearly looked liked a craft with the wings UP like on a navy shipped when they docked on the aircraft carrier. It was more than odd, it was not from this world. This particular craft came out of the clouds, approached toward my area directly downward and then veered oddly somewhat southbound on a dime, with absolutely NO movement from the UPWARD CLOSED wings. The wings were like a bird but stayed locked upward still. It then did a 360 motion (turn)  in FULL VIEW with a second, while still moving back into the clouds, upward like a helicopter’s movements, without hesitation and clearly like no craft this world has or any I know of, 3-4 miles from it previous location in SECONDS.

This very evening myself an four other members of our family witnessed two square formations of light in the evening sky. These formations were approximately two miles south of Peyia. Each formation comprised of four bright circular red lights, one in each corner of the square. As I have said, there were two of these formations.  The lights appeared to be identical in colour and size.  Even the formations were at the same altitude, but were maybe a mile away from each other. Commercial airlines were above the area heading both toward and away from the Island and I would say that the air traffic was medium-busy.  It appeared that the lights were below these aircraft, so I would say that these lights were at between 5,000 to 10,000 feet in the sky. These eight lights (one for each corner of the two formations) remained constant in strength and did not pulse or flicker and neither of the formations moved (they appeared to 'hover' in the sky as aircraft were passing them).  The weather conditions were fine and for the entire 4 minutes of which we viewed these lights nothing obscurred our sight.  Although a few photographs were taken, none actually managed to successfully capture the lights.  We were unable to notice any sound from the lights.  After a breif period, the lights just 'went', as though somebody had flicked a switch. Although not linked to the above, I witnessed something similar in 2002 in Norfolk, UK.  Then it was a single red light moving slowly across the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2009-04-14T00:00:00,,

The incident occurred on 04-11-2010 in Terre Haute, IN.  It lasted for at least a half an hour between 9:45-10:30 pm EST.  My husband and I were on our way to return a movie rental and from there, to the gas station.  A few minutes earlier, I had tried to go to the gas station that was closest to home, but the lines were backed up and the attendant said the systems were down.  So, I came home and told my husband what was going on and that I'd try later.  He said he wanted to make sure the tank was filled, so he decided to come along and after returning the movie, we would just go to the gas station that's a few miles down the street.  As we were leaving the parking lot of the video store, (driving west) I noticed a very bright white light, coming from the east just over the trees well north of us.  At first, I thought it was a low-flying plane but it seemed to be moving faster than a plane and it had no colored lights just very bright white.  I told my husba! nd, who was driving at the time, what I was seeing and he tried to get a look, but we were on a fairly busy street and the object was coming in and out of view from behind trees. He didn't want to cause an accident so, I just kept watching the object, waiting for it to reach an open area.  While I was watching it, the object went from a fast-moving white light to nearly a stop and all the bright white lights turned bright red.  It appeared to be hovering or moving very slowly in the north sky.  As I was telling my husband what had just happened, that I wasn't crazy, and I knew what I had seen...we turned south.  It was then behind us and out of view.  While driving maybe 3 city blocks south, I noticed the red lights again, this time, in an open area in the distant southwestern sky.  It must've moved really fast toward the south (without us noticing) in order for it to be that far ahead of us that soon.   Finally, my husband saw it too.  When we reached the gas station (the ! one that's a few miles from home) I went inside to pre-pay and! the att endant said the system had just went down.  My husband stayed outside watching the object that appeared to be hovering or moving really slow still to the south of us.  We pulled out from the gas station (driving east) and the object appeared to be moving again slowly toward the northeast.   It looked like it was going to pass directly overhead and we were in an area where we could pull off the road into a vacant lot.  My husband got out of the car, looked up, and watched it slowly pass over us.   He described it as a triangular object with distinct bright red lights at the corners and 1 white light, that made only a slight humming sound.  I couldn't hear anything from inside the car.  I would think any plane flying that low and that slow would be much louder than a slight hum, but I could be wrong.  I had my cell phone on me but didn't think to take a picture because, at that time, we were just trying to figure out what it was.  It seemed to be heading northeast toward the s! ame area where I had initially seen it.  We pulled out of the lot and headed north again to the gas station nearest home to see if their systems were up yet.  The object remained on the west side of us moving north toward the east.  We watched it the entire time we were driving, and this time, I tried to take a picture of it with my cell phone.  The street lights and the treetops that were near the object were visible on my screen but, the red lights were not showing for me to get a picture.  It was like my camera couldn't pick it up.  We pulled up to the gas station (nearest our home) and I went inside to ask if the system was working yet.  The attendant told me it was working fine now... so, I pre-paid.  I went outside to pump the gas and the pump said OUT OF SERVICE.  The attendant came over the intercom and said ""I'm sorry, it'll be a few minutes the system just went down again.""  The object continued on it's way to the northeast until it was out of view. It was then, t! hat conveniently, the system came back up and I was finally ab! le to fi ll up my tank.  I never saw it return to the bright white lights that I had initially seen, it remained red until it disappeared from view.  I don't know how to explain the systems going down whenever that thing was in the vicinity, or how I couldn't pick up the lights on my camera.  I don't know if anyone else noticed this or reported it.  It happened right over town and there were many people out and about.  Maybe it was just a plane and the systems failing was all just a coincidence...I don't know.  All I do know, is it was a ""weird"" and rather frustrating experience for us.  I would also like to know if anyone else experienced this.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,39.429084183673474,-87.3756556122449

After a hard day, I thought it might be nice to sit and enjoy a small pot of tea in my back yard, which faces north. I first went out at twilight, around 9:30. I have a good view of the eastern and northern sky. Portions of the western sky are blocked by trees. My house blocks the southern sky. Directly overhead was one of the bright stars of the constellation Draco, the first star in my field of view bright enough to be visible. It was still too bright out for other stars to be visible. As I unwound and watched the sky, I thought I saw a flash or twinkle in the northern sky, almost due north, about 35 - 40 degrees up. Perhaps the sun glinting off a satellite, I thought, or maybe the navigation lights of a high-altitude jet aircraft crossing the country. Intrigued, I scanned for signs of an aircraft. About half a minute later, I saw it again, in exactly the same place. That ruled out a plane a satellite or, at least, the same plane or satellite, but what are the chances of two of either reaching that same spot within half a minute? Could be my eyes playing a trick on me, can't rule that out. Half a minute or so later, another flash or twinkle. A few minutes later, same thing. Always in exactly the same spot, near as I could tell. I got distracted for awhile by some things in the yard and inside the house, but was back watching the sky a little before 10:00. By that time, it was dark enough that I could make out more stars. There was no star visible where I saw the twinkle. There would be a couple of stars in the constellation Camelopardalis that would be visible in that area most nights, but it's still too light out to see any stars around there at 10:00 at this time of year. Toward the northeast, one of the brighter stars of Cassiopeia was now visible. Further east, I saw a light aircraft with flashing navigation lights flying level, headed due west. I watched the small plane cruise through the sky, noticing that there was another small plane flying a parallel path to the south. I figured one of them, probably the slower and more southerly one, was Saskatoon's police patrol plane, which is out most nights. It looked like the more northerly plane could have been preparing for an approach to the airport. After a few moments it reached the part of the sky where I saw the strange twinkling earlier, so my eyes were now drawn back to that area. Suddenly there was another flash of light from the same spot as before, but this time it was much brighter. The shape was not like a twinkling star, but more like a line or thin cylinder or dumbbell kind of shape, consisting of two very bright twinkly points, shining momentarily like sparklers on a birthday cake, with a straight, thin bright or shiny line joining them. The two bright points were maybe two degrees apart, about the width of my little finger at arm's length. The phenomenon lasted only a fraction of a second, maybe an eighth to a quarter of a second at most, but long enough that it was unmistakable. It made me jump. I watched the sky for several minutes, but did not see any other twinkles or flashes. Frankly, I began feeling a little uneasy once the bright flash occurred, and I packed up my tea and lawn chair and came into the house by about 10:15. I suspect that whatever it was, was very high in the sky. I would be curious to know if anyone in a more northerly community had seen this, and how it would have looked from their vantage point.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,52.1078373650108,-106.66923239740821

Since we are in a rural location and it was dark out, we were seeing her home safely.  She happened to point out that the stars looked different -  We are all avid sky watchers - and all looked up to consider what she said.  She then said that she had never seen a certain tiny constellation in the Southwestern sky and we all looked to the area she was indicating.  My nephew asked if it had changed shape, and all four of us noted the change from a 'ladle' shape to a square and then a triangle.   Stunned, we watched the shape chnage further into a rounded heart shape, a line, a zig zag, and I told my daughter to get her camera which she had left inside my house. While she was trying to video tape the object, I went into the house, got my camera, and turned all the lights out.  I went back outside and we watched and did our best to document what we were seeing. If the ground were at 0 and directly above us were a 10, the object would have been near the 7. As we stared towards the South South East, the Pleiades was at a 9 and to our left (East).   At arm's length, it would have taken a nickel to cover it. At first we thought the lights were shifting into the repeating shapes, but as we watched over 2 hours, we realized it was a saucer shaped object with the lights along the edge and the ship was rotating, causing the light pattern to shift. The object drifted to the East very slowly, and then drifted back to the West.  We could not judge the size very well, but for some reason we all thought it was huge.   We watched a Sattelite go from the south west to the north east and I would guess that the object was about the same level as it, as the lights were of a similar size.  It could have been smaller and much closer - It was impossible to tell. We also noted several shooting stars, including one that 'shot' slower and did not fade as it curved from the area of the object and went East. We tried very hard to remain calm, but we all felt a sense of awe and gratitude.  We all sent mental messages of  thanks, for what it may have been worth - and we all felt excited and nearly euphoric.  We all agreed that what we were seeing was beautiful. Although we took dozens of pictures and videos, which we will gladly send in if requested, the lights were apparently not strong enough to be picked up by our cameras.  Maybe someone has a program on their computer that can help see what may have been picked up in the videos.  We did enhance one of the pictures and discovered that what we thought was a saucer shape was actually triangular!

On Aug. 24 the ISS was scheduled to appear in the NW at 4:21AM. As I was leaving my house walking north I noticed a group of 3 stars similar to Orion’s belt but this was near the north star in the sky approximately 45 degrees N in the sky. The Orion constellation at this time should be in the lower ESE sky. Because I was walking all the stars appear to be moving but of coarse it is due to my movement. So I stopped walking and noticed 2 of the 3 stars moving east in a parallel formation. As they moved easterly they stayed the same distance from each other (about the same distance from each other as the Orion’s belt) and became dimmer until I could no longer see them approximately 20 degrees NE. Their brightness resembled a medium size star when first noticed. Not as bright as the ISS. When the ISS appeared later in the morning it was lower in the sky (about 20 degrees) and brighter than the stars I had seen earlier but at about the same speed in the same direction. They did not appear to be planes. There wasn’t any flashing lights. Just a steady glow as a medium star.

I examined it for indicators or other signs/noise of an aircraft and found none.  Plus it wasn't on the flight path. I decided this was unusual and a bit odd but thought it was probably easily explained, except it was followed seconds later by another!  This followed a similar path though slightly wider. They were soundless, bright orange balls of light, not particularly high in the sky, moving fairly quickly in a straight line. My mum saw something similar last week in Wiltshire whilst driving.

It was about 2 to 3 miles away, and it was floating 300-400 feet off the ground.  It was flashing, and seemed to be spinning as well. The sun was at an angle that I couldn’t see it too well.  It rose at a speed that was far faster than the wind could carry it. I was contemplating calling my mom, when another one appeared coming from below and to the right. It went up and joined the other one, it followed it for a few seconds and then went off on it’s own.  I don’t recall what exactly they did in terms of formation. I called my mom over and showed them to her.  She saw them better because she had sunglasses on.  Another one appeared several seconds later. They were flying around erratically, constantly changing altitudes. The highest I saw them get was 4000-5000 feet.  By the time they left there were 4-5 of them and we were sure these were UFO’s. They left going north. I can’t really say how big they were, but they were big enough to be seen without assistance from very far.  I think they were probes or scouts of some sort, but I’m not sure.

I took my eye off the batter to look up at an overhead plane, and on the way, I noticed a small object only about 30 feet away over the field. The item was charcoal gray, probably metallic, and in the shape of a toaster.  It was only about one foot in size.  It spun around in circles, but always remained parallel to the ground, and had something similar to a reflector light on a bicycle in the upper right corner, which shined like a dimmed light.  It also had a small amount of haze over it. The item must have came in over the third base side of the stadium, I saw it when it was directly in front of me, and continued its path over the first base side of the stadium, accelerating after leaving the stadium, until out of view. When I first looked at it, I thought it was a garbage bag, floating in the wind, but then realized it couldn’t because a garbage bag would roll over rather than remain parallel.  It couldn’t have been a balloon, because it was not going in the exact same direction in the wind, nor was it rising at a fast pace or going straight up. I did not bother taking a picture of it, because when I saw it, I thought nothing of it, and when I realized this could be something else, it was too small and too far away to get a good shot with my cell phone camera.  However, my friend who I was at the game with saw it, and as many as 1,000 other people sitting in the vicinity could have potentially seen it.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

However, within moments I realized something unusual about the crafts overall shaped.  I quickly excused myself off the phone and ran inside my house to call my girlfriend, Lisa, to the back of the house to also observe and further confirm what I was witnessing. Upon Lisa and I's arrival to the back of the house, just moments later, the craft was still in the sky and still traveling across the western sky moving from North to South through the Constellation of Leo, from above the 40 degree azimuthal grid line to below it. The can best be described as a Triangular shaped craft with three white lights appearing to be located on the vertices of the crafts underbelly and one red flashing light appearing to be located upon the center of the crafts underbelly (ventral).  In addition I was also able to hear what I believe to be engine noise emanating from the craft.  The sound was similar to that of a low steady rumble of a jet engine at high altitude traveling at cruising speed. The craft was also not traveling at any unusual speed or pattern and appeared to be moving across the sky at, would appear to be, a comparatively reasonable speed for any aircraft.

They had a blinking that was visible even from that height. They stayed fairly immobile compared to the day before. There were more than last time, and they actually made several shapes. Several times, they formed a rhombus, an arrow pointing right, and various other formations that I could not understand. They seemed to be at a very high altitude, being at maybe 10,000-20,000 feet. After 4-5 minutes, 2 or 3 of the crafts descended and were maybe 4000-5000 feet directly above my area. They moved at a speed that was beyond anything I’ve ever seen before. I have seen similar UFO’s two days in a row. I believe this is not a coincidence. They might be monitoring humans, or giving a personal message, or they could be military devices that haven’t been exposed to the public. Well, I’m not giving this report to tell you my opinion.

The 2 objects shot through the sky in parallel about a pencil length apart and appeared simply as flying dots of light in the sky no bigger than a large star before changing shape into a sort of bird like object. There is a crop circle formation that bears a striking resemblance to the shape of what we saw at the following website:  http://shrey27.wordpress.com/2008/05/24/crop-circles-art-on-crop-fields/crop-circles-014/  During the transition of shape the color began to look more like a glowing tan or yellow hazy, misty color  They were so synchronized in their movements and transitions that I wondered if one wasnt a reflection of the other. From my location they originated at a nearly 60 degree + angle and towards the NorthWest.  They moved in a sort of elongated V or sharp hook pattern and disappeared to the NorthEast.  They appeared to get larger until they were finally out of sight. All in all this sighting lasted maybe 5 or 6 seconds and was fast enough that my girlfriend completely missed it as she was staring a different direction and couldn't catch the glimpse. My reaction was literally ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT! Seriously, what the fuck was that? What was that..."" I stood there in shook as I was dumbfounded how my girlfriend could have missed something that obvious. While she watched the sky I ran inside to see what time it was and my PC said 11:28. So we stared at the sky thinking about how great it would be if we could both see it together and after about 15 minutes something appeared again. This time we both saw it.  2 ""dove"" shaped objects flying from the NorthWest toward the SouthWest.  These 2 objects were much closer together, approximately the length of an eraser tip on a pencil, and flew in a very strange pattern:  First they were side by side, then the synchronistically flew away from each other and back toward each other as if to draw out a vase sort of shape in the sky. Before flying out of sight I could see them veer a sharp ""left"" as if they were right on top of each other and I was able to follow these for a much greater distance than the previous sighting. My girlfriend and I were absolutely amazed and talked about how these objects had a very strange ""bird like"" appearance and almost glowed. I ran inside immediately after I lost sight of them to check the time and it was 11:43.  I grabbed a pen and paper and recorded a couple notes and the time and went back to watching the sky. 7 minutes later at 11:50 we witnessed a mass formation of 5 to 6 objects flying in single file order but making snake like movements across the sky while maintaining a very tight, smooth, formation.  This was by far the most exciting and heart racing sighting. These objects seemed to appear out of no where and were spotted slightly lower in the sky than the previous 2 sightings. Last week I filed a UFO sighting with MUFON because I spotted a very similar object but it was much darker, more like a silhouette and not nearly as clearly defined and illuminated as these objects were.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,47.7887,-116.7112

If an aircraft were to drop a flare right above you it would seem high in the sky, but if you were 10-20 miles away the flares would seem low on the horizon because of the distance which is how I could describe it.  These lights to me didn't seem like flares because they did not appeare one after the other. When they appeared it was almost like a formation of fighters that lit there after burners all at the same time only from the distance between the lights and myself it would not be redish white but more like a star.  These objects remained in the sky for about 3 min and then all disappeared like they appeared.

The moonlight overpowered the other stars so I knew it was not a star, it was not a steady light so I knew it couldn’t be a planet (i.e. Mars, Jupiter, Venus, etc), and it was in the wrong place for a plane (I live beneath the flight path for Alliance Airport and if I stand in front of my house, I can see the planes traveling to DFW & Love Field; these flight paths are very consistent)… there were no other aircraft in the sky at all (I looked) and it has been my experience that planes pretty much stop passing over my house or in front of it around 11:00pm at night.

Height was under 1000 ft.  Plane possibly looked like a C-130 (it was getting dark so it is hard to tell exact aircraft).  The plane was flying north along the east side of the Sandia Mountains.  The reason I looked up is because I could hear the engines as it was pretty loud and low flying (planes do not typically fly this close to the ground as the airport / Kirtland AFB is about 15 miles to the south.

To the East above my neighbors roofline I was a BRIGHT ORANGE/RED pulsating sphere.  At first glance, I thought it was fireworks.  However, it moved way too slow and just hovered.  Next, I thought airplane, although there was zero sound plus it was way too bright. The sphere slowly tracked a course to the Northwest, and slowly gained elevation.  I asked my wife to hurry outside.  When she arrived the sphere had continued to gain elevation, and dwindle in size and intensity. The sphere started out very bright and roughly the size of a full moon.  The sphere tracked a deliberate course to the Northwest all the while gaining elevation.  I watched this sphere for roughly one minute.  It started out at roughly 15 degrees in the horizon very intense, and slowly dissipated at 60 plus degrees in the horizon. Wife: I was packing for vacation in the bedroom by the window when I heard my husband quietly say, “Babe, come here and take a look at this.”  When I went outside my husband was standing at the end of our yard looking in an Eastward direction.  I immediately saw what he was looking at…A BRIGHT ORANGE circular light that was smoothly moving thru the evening sky.  He said, “What do you think that is?”  I replied immediately with, “ A UFO.”  He said, “it isn’t making any sound at all.”  I then yelled for my eleven year old daughter to come out into the yard to take a look.  We all stood there in amazement and watched as the object faded away. The entire sighting was 1 minute in length.  We were facing in the East direction.  The object traveled in a Northwest direction.  At my initial look the object was approximately 30-40 degrees from the horizon, close to the size of the full moon.  The color was BRIGHT ORANGE, and never changed in vividness.  At my last view of the object it was approximately 60 degrees still heading in the exact same Northwest direction.  The object seemed to become invisible due to distance.  It became smaller than a star upon no longer being able to view it. The experience made the hair all over me stand on end, and my body was covered in goose bumps that lasted for a good 20-30 minutes after coming into our home and locking the door.

The time was about 9:15p.m.  When I walked outside the color of it was bright orange with a little bit of red.  By the time I had got outside, it was fairly small but very visible.  It looked like it was smaller than the moon, but bigger than a star.  While I stood in amazement the object was at about a 50 degree angle from the horizon.  The UFO moved smoothly thru the sky for the approximate 30 seconds that I was out there.

We stood there watching for a while, bemused. A few minutes later one appeared and disappeared then another right beside it, which seemed to move horizontally in the sky. Then we saw two come on at once, then the left one would disappear followed by the right. This pattern repeated itself with the lights, never losing altitude, though one looked like it shifted at a 45 degree angle downward and to the east, stopped for a moment, and then disappeared. We watched this go on for 30 minutes and then nothing.  We did see the blinking lights of several aircraft, also in the southern sky around the lights, but could not discern the 3-dimensionality of it (ie: if they were right next to them or some distance away).",2009-08-05T00:00:00,,

One of my friends, whose shoulders were almost parallel to the object’s path, got a really puzzled look on his face and pointed toward the sky.  I turned, my shoulders about perpendicular to the path, to see a very bright, light green object about the size of the moon traveling quickly from roughly south to north.  My second friend turned all the way around and saw the bright light travelling quickly behind the clouds. The object was definitely circular, possibly spherical.  It had a tail about twice the length of the object that gradually came to a point.  It was only visible for a second or two due to clouds and trees but I was able to see it cover about 40 to 50 degrees of sky (the angle created by pointing where I first saw it to where it went behind the clouds).  It looked very much like the green ball a Roman candle shoots but without any smoke.  There was no noise except that of the cars on the street and the wind blowing through the trees. I’m not sure what it was.  I grew up by an airport and have seen all different types of planes come in all types of whether at all types of angles and it was definitely not a plane.  I read that green meteorites sometimes occur but if it was, it was either big enough that I’ll be hearing about it on the news tomorrow or close enough that we would have an impact noise at least.  We were standing on church property, which is quite large, so short range fireworks are out of the question.

We were watching a recording of an earlier program we like to watch.  We had been out on a local lake with my son (the one who saw this object) earlier in the evening .  Our favorite program came on and I recorded it while we were still out on the lake.  My husband and I came on home and left our son at the lake so he could catfish after dark. When we got home we turned on the recording and were watching it from 22:00 to around 22:58.  The signal was interrupted several times as we watched the recording.  This is not a common occurrence at all on recordings from our HD TV. We just kind of wondered why the signal was messed up and let it go at that.  When my son came in around 23:00, he mentioned that he had seen something really “strange” streak across the sky as he sat out on the lake in our boat. He said “It was HUGE”…. And that jets from the Air Base (Dyess) had gone up shortly after the object appeared, streaking across the sky towards  Buffalo Gap, where we live. He said the object looked a lot like a meteor streak but was “huge” . He went on to say that the jets from Dyess were circling the area around and between Buffalo Gap and Tuscola (to our southwest approx. 5 miles).  We have no idea what he might have seen , but thought we should say something to someone.  Surely, many others must have seen this event as well.  We thought you might want to check into it and see what it might have been.  Incidentally, my son is 31 years old and not a goofball. He called me after he left my house to go to his apartment (he doesn’t live with us and had come to bring our boat we had left with him) and said that there was several aircraft in the sky still circling our area.  It was approx 23:45 at that point.  It is not unusual to see aerial ac! tivity w ith the Dyess Air Force Base right in between Buffalo Gap and Abilene…however, it is odd to see a cluster of activity around an unknown event as my son saw.

I was out walking the dog around 5-5:30 on Friday August 8, 2008, I believe. I know it was dark outside. I saw heard the sound of a jet plane passing far overhead and looked to see if I could find the plane. What I saw was three large red flashing lights arranged in an equilateral triangle, traveling much closer to the ground than most flying vehicles normally fly. The object came from behind some trees to the SW and flew, in a straight line and at a steady rate, to the NE, where it disappeared again behind trees. I could not see a form or a reflection because the sky was so dark, but I could not see other objects in the area between the lights. I cannot approximate how low the object was flying because it was so dark, but it is significantly lower than I have hitherto ever seen an object flying. I did not see the trees respond to its passing, so I assume it was well above them. I though the jet-sound was coming from this vehicle until I noticed a jet flying over the object when it was directly overhead. The jet-plane was very obviously a plane - an elongated triangle with colored lights on the short end and a white light at the peak – and was traveling ESE to WNW, which is the direction planes usually go over this area in, we being located very close to an airport. I am inclined to believe that the object was a plane of some sort, perhaps at an odd angle, but don’t know why it would be flying so low or in a direction so different from the norm. I did watch it cross the sky in the hopes of seeing the shape of the vehicle, thereby allowing me to have a better chance of identifying the vehicle, until it left the sky. I am a teacher with some training in psychology; I am trained to take a skeptic’s approach to everything. I grew up living just about next-door to an airport, and have always liked sky-gazing (very difficult near an airport) so am very familiar with what various plane-lights look like. My first action upon returning home was to type a description into a search engine to see if I could find what plane-signal would require lighting as described above.   I then looked for other man-made flying vehicles which would have 3 lights arranged in a triangle along its belly. All I found were two pictures online of similar lights (I did not have a camera), but both were called UFOs. One was photographed in in Texas February 9, 2005, the other in Alabama in April 26, 2004.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,33.8595,-84.6838

Although I had 3 other standard aircraft in view it was very difficult to determine size or distance of the fourth out-of-place flying object. It seemed to be flying at about the same altitude as the jets or perhaps a bit lower. The object moved so strangely (sort of curving or arced movements) that I ran inside to grab the digital camera. Of course the damn battery was recharging in the wall socket. Grabbed it anyway, loaded into camera, ran outside (it turned on), but when I aimed at object it was already getting too far away to see anything.

The object at first appeared stationary at an altitude of approximately 4000 feet. Then the object began dropping flare like objects that were falling directly towards the ground. It appeared as if it were an object that was on fire and breaking apart. Similar to an aircraft and/or a spacecraft re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. However, the object began changing directions moving at a slow speed. Then object then developed a comet like tail but much shorter in length than a normal comet. The object resembled a fireball but it never appeared to lose altitude. It remained at the same height and speed. The object flew directly towards the West approaching the Mississippi River and then turned to a Southerly direction. It would make very sharp turns, in fact, the turning radius was such that the object appeared to almost cross paths with it's on fiery tail.  The object would drop flare like objects intermittently similar to a military aircraft dispersing flares. Again having the appearance of an object on fire and breaking apart but the object continued flying at the apparent same speed and altitude. It made several complete circles and then reversed it's original course of due west and began traveling back toward my direction at an Easterly heading. The object had no visible navigation lights. No blinking lights or anything indicating that it were any form of a known aircraft. The fireball object continued in the Easterly direction directly over the city of Baton Rouge and then slowly headed South until it disappeared over the horizon.  The object was clearly visible to anyone in Baton Rouge looking up. I noticed that other vehicles traveling on I-12 were reducing their speed as I was perhaps because they were gazing at the object. I had my cell phone with me and attempted to take a picture but was afraid of being involved in an accident.  For the record: This is my fourth experience at witnessing something very unusual in the night sky. The other incidents were the typical bright objects traveling at a huge rate of speed and then sharply changing directions. However, this recent incident is different. I'm very skeptical of it being any ""U.F.O."" because of the flare like objects dropping from it. But it confuses me as the how the object appeared to remain intact, never losing altitude or speed and flying off into the horizon.

Conducting what seemed like ""games"" of tag.  Incredible speeds and incredible turns. I was out in my front yard, talking on the phone with my best friend.  It was approximately 11:30 pm and the night sky was absolutely clear and you could see hundreds of stars.  I noticed what I thought was a shooting star but it blinked, so then I thought it was some kind of aircraft.  I realized in just a second or two that there were three objects alike, in the same general area of the night sky.  All three were darting here and there, many times turning on a ""dime"".  More than once, making a 90 degree turn.  As they danced around a large portion of the sky, they would blink realy quick, sometimes.  But not constant.  They seemed to almost be playing ""tag"".  Their speed was phenomenal, and much faster than anything I am familiar with.  Plus, they could change direction in a blink, and ""we"" have nothing that can do that, at that speed, to my knowledge.  I was describing all I was seeing to my buddy Gary, and we were both trying to come up with an answer th! at made sense for what I was seeing.  I sometimes did not talk when he was asking me questions because I was entralled with what I was seeing. About two or three minutes (maybe less) into watching this, they ""zipped"" away in different directions.  I kept talking with my buddy and kept watching the sky.  About four or five minutes later, I observed one of those same objects, heading north at an incredible speed.  Behind it but far back was an obvious airplane, probably a military jet because of its speed, going in the same direction.  I had the impression that it was trying to catch or keep track of the ""object"" in front of it.  The airplane was going really really fast, but was ""dusted"" by the object in front of it, which seemed to be traveling at approximately 1 1/2 to 2 times the speed of the airplane.  They both disappeared to the north.  When I was observing these three objects in the beginning, they often would blink really quickly, a white light with no discernable colors, but would not constantly blink.  The blinking was very fast.  Faster than helocopters of airplane lights blink.  But sometimes they would not blink for a second or two.  When they were not blinking, I could still make out an object in the direction of travel at any given moment, which appeared to be a dull grey or silver in color, streaking.  These objects were very high in the sky.  What I would describe as ""outer space"".  I can not explain how I could see them when they were not blinking, as there seemed to be no light other than that which blinked.  Maybe it was a reflection from the moonlight.  I don't know.  I have never before observed something I could not explain, prior to this.  I served 8 years in the U.S. Marine Corps and 4 months in the Navy.  I am 56 years old and a retired Cleveland police officer.  I retired as a Lieutenant, and I was recognized by the U.S. Congress (108th Congress) for my service and career.  My buddy who was on the phone with me at the time, is currently a working police officer in Cleveland.  I have spend 24 hours or so, replaying in my mind and recollection, all of what I observed last night, and can not come up with a logical explanation.  I have told no one except my wife, who is visiting our son in Texas, and my buddy Gary.  I will add that in my area, we get a lot of military aircraft that conduct manuevers above our home.  There are usually two but sometimes three, always in the daylight hours, apparently practicing.  On one occasion, my wife and I actually observed one of the planes shoot an object, but we do not know what it was or where it went.  This shot object disappeared into some clouds.  Every once in awhile these military aircraft break the sound barrier and rattle our home.  We just assume these military jets are from Wright Patterson AFB, which is not to far from us.  Oh, one more thing.  When I was observing the three unknown blinking objects, there was absolutely no sound.  When I observed the one streaking north, it was also silent but I could hear the loud coming airplane that was way behind it, going in the same direction.  My ""feeling"" is that the airplane was a lot lower in the sky, than the object it was following behind.  I don't have anything else to add.  Please let me know if you get any other reports frm my area, during that same time period.  I am just amazed and confused.  I need glasses to read but my long range vision is very good.  I can not come up with a logical explanation for what I observed.",2009-08-27T00:00:00,39.1669,-83.5655

It was larger then a star but very bright white.  It was far off but seemed to just stay in one spot, like a star.  I took a picture of it but it only came out black as it was still dark.  (later I took a picture in day light but at this writing the white light does not seem to show in the picture)   As day light turned brighter and became full day light, the sky was clear light blue with only the bright light in the sky.  The light seemed to be moving away from the earth. I got my binoculars and then view two separate lights close together.  The bigger light, 3/8 inch in size was on the right and looking with the binoculars the left side had a much small 1/8 inch white light on the left, just next to the bigger light.  With time both had slowly moved 2 inches away from each other all seen using the binoculars.  Looking at the light without the binoculars appeared to be one light. Now this is the strange part, the 1/8 inch light on left appeared instantly with a group of about 24 lights, smaller then the 1/8 inch light, which formed a 12 inch diameter circle.  Inside the circle the 24 lights each seem to be spaced very evenly, like a diamond display or a 4th of July fireworks that spreads out in a designed circle.  That 12 inch circle stayed behind the smaller light, on the left, and stayed at the 2 inch space from the light on the right.  After about 15 minutes both seemed to be moving further away from earth. A little later, the bigger 3/8 inch light on the right then also instantly produced the same type circle with all the arranged small lights only this circle was only 4 inches in diameter.  We viewed this 2nd circle for about 10 minutes along with the 12 inch circle with the small light on the left. During this time the sun was not up, just day light, all clear blue sky when some clouds from the south came and finally blocked the sight of the two white lights.

On the afternoon of June 5, 2009, my wife, daughter, son and I witnessed some unexplainable activity in the sky above Victoria, TX.  We were swimming in the pool at my mom and dad’s house when I noticed what we first thought looked like a balloon lifting across the sky at a distance to the north -northeast.  I watched the object track across the sky for a couple of minutes, and then noticed a second object, and then a third tracking behind the first object on a similar trajectory.  I was ready to dismiss them as released balloons of some sort until all three of the objects began to flash and then switched directions and began circling back toward the direction they came from.  It was then that I became very interested in what we were witnessing.  The objects were barely visible against the blue sky, but were much easier to see with my polarized sunglasses. My son and my daughter were able to see the objects with their naked eye.  My wife had to put on my sunglasses to see them. The objects were joined by two others and they began to rotate in a circular pattern.  It was then that I noticed another object that appeared fixed in the sky at a higher altitude and these objects appeared to be rotating in a pattern beneath the stationary object.  As I was watching this happen, I noticed what appeared to be two military jets at extremely high altitude circling the area in a much wider pattern.  It then occurred to me that maybe they were looking for these objects.  My wife suggested that maybe it was some sort of training exercise.  When the jets turned back to the northeast, all of the circulating flashing objects began to disappear one-by-one.  The stationary object remained and I watched it stay in this same position for at least another 10 minutes.  The object then began to drift slowly to the east – southeast and looked like it was also getting farther away as it became much harder to see.  The object then stopped and remained stationary As I continued watching the object, I saw the two military jets again.  They were travelling on the same flight path, but were much farther apart than before.  They followed a similar path as they had earlier but appeared to be much higher and slower.  I then spotted a third jet that was on a different path and appeared to be heading more in the direction of the stationary object. .  I sent my wife out to my truck to get my digital camera so I could attempt to get some shots of the object before it moved out of sight.  I took several pictures, but it was impossible to see the object in the screen on the camera.  The stationary object then began to move very slowly and then vanished from sight. By this time I was pretty worked up and was scanning the sky for more activity.  I was about to give up when just over the roof of the house, again to the north-northeast , I saw two more objects moving across the sky.  One was flashing, and one was solid.  The flashing one disappeared rather quickly, so I continued to watch the solid one.  It moved across the sky in a similar manner to the previous one.  I tried taking several more pictures, and then I watched it until I could no longer see it, which was probably about 5 minutes. The only way I can describe what we saw is that the solid objects looked similar to what a satellite would look like moving across the night sky (except for the stopping and changing directions) and the flashing objects looked like what something flat and reflective spinning in the wind would look like as it reflected the sun.  I am truly amazed and mystified.  I wish there was a way I could find out where the jets came from and what they were doing there.   I feel very strongly that they were looking at the same thing I was. I am going to download the photos from my camera as soon as I finish this and see if there is anything there.  I will send photos if they come out.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,28.853642285714283,-96.9943577142857

I was very intrigued by this sighting because it was unlike any other.   I'll start out with the color if the light.  It was a very bright yellowish or amber color.  It would increasingly get brighter and fade out.  It would be about 10 second intervals and then light back up again.  This occurred for 10 minutes. I can tell you that it is not a plane or helicopter.  First of all, the light was vast.  I have seen many planes fly behind my house and their beacons and strobes are green and red like most all planes.  It would also stop in the air for about 15 seconds and then continue its circular pattern.  It was also right over this field in the country.  I would estimate about 2-3 miles out due NNE. I would also say that it was 10 degrees above the horizon.  It made no noise so it definitively was not a plane or helicopter.  I hope you guys look in to this.  Thanks for believing.

There were about 10 people in the street watching. The highest craft had two bright white lights on it, and the craft appeared to be hovering, then moving a few feet, and then hovering again. Beneath this craft was a second craft that had two very bright neon-blue lights. It made wide circles about 100 feet under the other craft. Both craft made small changes in altitude and direction, but generally stayed in the area above our neighborhood for about 15-20 minutes or so. A third craft (with blinking red and white lights on it) started to close on the higher craft, and this one looked more like a conventional aircraft. At one point it flew between the two craft (below the higher one and above the lower one). At that point the lower one (with the bright neon-blue lights on it) began flying in a fast semi-vertical circular pattern. The third craft continued on, and eventually the higher-flying craft began to fly away in a northwestern direction. I ran to my house and got my camera, but by then they were all gone.  I checked, and no else had a camera to take any photos. I called the Modesto Police Dept. to see if anyone else had reported seeing the lights.

It was about 30 minutes to our arrival at LAX.   I was looking at an unusual cloud formation that looked like a a contrail of some sort, that was nearly parallel in height to the jet plane we were in.  The white contrail at first just seemed to stop, which is why I thought it was just a cloud formation.   My daughter was in the window seat, so I asked her to look out the window and tell me if she saw anything unusual.   We both stared out the window and she said she saw 4 dark circles that seemed to be in a boomerang formation.   While she is saying this, I realized that the contrail didn't just end, it WAS behind 4 dark circles.    Whatever it was, it was flying slower than the plane, so we had had to strain to continue to see it.  Neither of us thought to get a camera and take a picture of it.  It did not appear to be that far away and the circles seemed to be about the size of a thumbnail at arms length.  They were large enough, that if it had been a plane, we should have been able to see some detail, like wings and a fuselage, but they were just dark circles.  It was strange.   Maybe there is a completely mundane explanation for what we saw, but it wasn't like anything I recognized.  I was hoping that someone else might have reported seeing something, because it did appear we were over a populated area.  You could see roads, houses, reservoirs, etc...",2009-05-12T00:00:00,,

It was a bright sunny day with no clouds.  We laid down to enjoy the day and we both spotted plane flying over head.  It was a normal passenger plane.  We are near an Air Force base and an International airport.   My wife and I are under a pine tree.  The plane disappears into the braches, and then we spot a very small yet super shinny object up In the sky.  It seemed to be higher than the plane and further away.  The plane crossed between us and the object in our field of view. The object was stationary.  I thought it was an astronomical event, maybe Venus shining very brightly for some odd reason.  So we did not try and find the plane after it flew over the tree we were under.  But neither of us ever saw it again. The UFO stayed in its position for approximately 15 minutes.  After a while we both had taken our eyes off of it, only too look back to its location and not see it there. Instead it was heading northeast at a decent pace, blinking like a light.  Its speed was maybe a little faster than a cruising passenger plane.  However we could not judge its altitude well.  It flew too far away and out of sight for us.  We did not have a video or picture abilities with us.  My wife and I were surprised and proceeded to try and interpret what we had saw. Then after we were digesting what we had saw, we looked back up and she spotted two more objects that were the exact same luminosity and size.  They were floating very slowly in the same direction as the previous one.  They floated away over a period of ten minutes and out of view, however they never blinked or sped up.

It was headed NE from here looked like it was going at a smooth clip but didn't seem too fast because it just glided through the air (my opinion) but I imagine it must have been going very fast. <--- Ok that sounds contradictory... what I mean to say is that it must have been going fast because it was going about as fast as one of theses LAPD choppers when they are cruising by but silent and I guess because of the lack of noise, it just seemed to glide by effortlessly which in my head made it seem like it was just strolling by. Sorry i really suck at explaining this... Bright white light... no blinking just solid Didn't have time to grab a camera but i did have binoculars nearby, through them, god help me I'm gonna say it... it looked triangular but that could be just what was exposed by the light. From what i could tell it seemed like the size of a Helicopter but in no way did it make me think it was one... just a size reference! The light on it was bigger than an LAPD chopper spotlight and it wasn't emitting a beam or anything, at least in my opinion... I see enough LAPD choppers at night to know the difference. Unless he was running with no lights but that one and somehow made his chopper completely silent. Made no noise whatsoever... I even started talking to it, saying ""hold on"", ""come closer"", sounds corny but I really wanted to communicate. God, I'm shaking I'm so excited... this was about 20 minutes ago 8:20 pm PST  Ok, so right after I typed this I heard some LAPD choppers over in the NE direction for awhile and then I heard them pass by my complex heading to what sounded to be in the SE direction. I also noted that the whole time this was going on, including while I was typing this post my cell phone kept turning off and rebooting itself over and over again and stopped after I heard the LAPD go by. Could be the phone though... I hate my blackberry. It couldn't have been LAPD or any other helicopter only due to the fact it seemed to be very close and made no noise at all.

Then, walking past the gym from the pathway from Doane Hall, noticed a very bright orange light shining through the trees.  As I walked past the gym toward the soccer field I saw the object flying toward me.  While walking through the middle of the soccer field it flew above me.  While that object was directly above me, I saw the different but same type of object flying in the distance toward me from another direction,  It was much farther away from me, but still close enough to see its size in relation to the previous one.  From my eyes, it was in the direction of the lower corner of the University parallel to the main entrance at eagle road. It flew in direction parallel to King of Prussia road.  After I crossed the soccer field towards my residence at Kea Guffin Hall, I walked toward the back parking lot of Kea, and as I was walking up the hill, another object flew over the trees, and over Kea Hall about 80 degrees above me.  I tried to take a picture of it with my cell, but the resolution was to low for the lights to be seen.  The duration of this sighting lasted 13 minutes. I witnessed 4 objects in total. These four objects were triangular in shape. There was a full moon out tonight (or what seemed to be), and in relation to how close to the ground these objects flew compared to the size of the moon, the size of the object was of equal or a little larger than the moon tonight.  These objects had 7 lights. In the middle, there was a red light, and at each point of the triangle there was one, as well as two between the front light and the two side lights. This is the first time I have seen unidentified objects that close to me, they couldn’t have been over 300 feet above me.  It was spectacular. Oddly enough, I wasn’t scared, but felt calm and at peace. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be a quite sincere person.

For a number of years now I have seen either a single star like object in the daytime very high up hovering in the sky or I have seen a formation of these same objects.  On one occasion I was with two other individuals and pointed them out and they saw them and we watched them move and hover in ways that no traditional aircraft operate. I am writing this now because this past weekend on two consecutive days (August 9th and 10th) I saw a single silver star like object motionless in the daytime sky. Both days were perfect weather wise with very clear visibility. On August the 9th in the afternoon at about 4 PM PST I noticed a silver colored point of light hovering in Eastern Sky perhaps 50 to 55 degrees from the horizon. I thought it might be a plane moving away from me and the sun was reflecting on it at an odd angle. But it just hung there with what I thought was perhaps a vibrating like movement. My wife was standing with me holding our 3 month old as we were preparing to go on a walk and she saw it as well. After about 3 to 5 minutes we couldn’t see it anymore. It appeared to just fade away but not like an object moving off – it either faded out or turned in such a way that the sun wasn’t hitting it. I think it important to note that the light may have been the sun reflecting off the object but while the object appeared very small and far away it was star like and obviously bright enough to been seen by the naked eye. The following day on the 10th at approximately 5:30 in the afternoon I again took the baby outside to sit on our front porch swing which faces east. I had this odd feeling that I would see the object again and when I looked up between two nearby trees there it was again in the sky. The object was higher this time but brighter and closer to my position. It began to slowly drift a bit from North to South and I knew in a moment it would be obscured by the leaves of one of the trees. Now I don’t know why but I tried, perhaps foolishly, to meditate on the object and make a ""connection,"" but it just kept drifting very, very slowly south. It was not a balloon, plane or helicopter and again the sky was perfectly clear and visibility was excellent. It would soon be out of my view so I slowly got up and went to see it from the front yard but when I looked up again it was gone. I searched the sky but to no avail. The entire encounter again lasted maybe five minutes but certainly less than ten. I am writing to you because I have seen these objects in the sky in LA before. They are not traditional aircraft. In the past I have seen them in formation and have seen them do patterns and maneuvers that, in my opinion, can not be easily explained. I have seen them with others present so I know I’m not just imagining things. Could these be the US military aerial Predator drones? I was thinking perhaps they are tested out from a nearby base. Wouldn’t they hover at high altitude? Could I just be seeing a satellite in geosynchronous orbit? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

There were no strobe lights on the object and there was no sound, so we knew that it wasn’t a regular air craft. It was moving in a south eastern direction. It moved like a satellite but was clearly in our atmosphere. It was traveling at a lower distance than the air craft in the area usually do.  It seemed to glide in the sky, then it sped up.  We watched it through the trees and over the houses.  The light suddenly got dimmer and dimmer until it vanished completely.  We could not identify what it was. W e do live near IAH Bush Airport.

It was brighter than any light on a plane that I have ever seen.  Two, the entire object looked spherical and unlike a plane or helicopter of any kind.  Lastly, the way and direction it was traveling was odd. It was moving fairly slow, but somewhat sporadically.  It also changed direction rather quickly with no wide turns like a plane or anything like that. Another thing that caught my attention was the direction of travel. I live somewhat close to LAX Airport and often watch the planes lined up for miles on their decent. Rarely do I see aircraft headed at a 90 degree angle towards the line of planes. It was a good deal higher than the planes on their way in for a landing and was of no threat to them. But again, I do not see aircraft flying in that direction.

I live in Powell, Ohio in an upper middle class housing development that is tucked away and surrounded by a large rural area. It was just after midnight on May 11, 2009 when we were preparing to turn onto my street. It was mostly cloudy with a bright moon that was at the time shielded by clouds. The moon was in the south east part of the sky. In the north sky we noticed, 4, almost round, but oval, objects of white light that were moving around and I think they were also crossing each other. The objects, at first, were moving at a consistently paced medium speed. The grouping of lights, as a whole, was also moving slowly away from me through the north sky. We drove around, followed and watched them for about two minutes and then stopped the van and I got out and watched for about 30 seconds more while my girlfriend remained in the van.  I decided to get my camera. I went back to the van and retrieved my camera. The area where the objects seemed to be was near a line of large electric towers. The objects seemed to stay together in the same part of the sky, but their moving around speed began to slightly increase. When I turned my camera on and was waiting for it to prepare to be able to use, the objects moved into the center of where they had been rotating and became one and disappeared. When they became one object, that single object did not increase in size or brightness. The lights did not appear to have been projected from the ground. Their intensity on the cloudy sky was not bright. They were not faint, but they were not bright. The entire incident lasted approximately 5 minutes. I then drove around for about 10 minutes toward the area where I had seen the lights. I don’t know if this was related to the objects we saw, but when I got back in my van to drive toward where I had seen the objects, one street light went out as I was beginning to pass by it. No other lights went out and there w! ere no o ther incidents. After approximately 15 minutes had passed since we first saw the objects, I made an anonymous phone call to the Delaware County Sheriff’s Office and asked them if there would be any reason why there would be strange lights in the sky in the area of Liberty Rd and Hyatts Rd.  The deputy said no and I then asked if anyone had reported seeing any lights in the sky. When he said no again, I stated that it must just be my eyes and hung up. I know what I saw and my girlfriend knows what she saw. When we got home, we wrote down the facts of what we both saw and I got on line to see if there were any similar sightings of the objects of light.

I'm not saying this was extraterrestrial but I have a good knowledge of aircraft military and commercial and have never seen anything like this before flying in the manner (horizontally) it was.

It was fluorescent blue and it seemed to be accelerating upwards. It seemed pretty close to the ground (about 200 ft)and what I'd liken it to was the back of a jet engine accelerating (when the orange becomes brighter) except it seemed quite wide like 30ft in diameter.  My girl friend witnessed it with me and then it suddenly vanished.  It was completely weird.  I honestly believe it was a ufo.. then we wouldn't stop looking out the window (as you would do after something like that) and noticed these three objects really high in the sky and I know it wasn't a helicopters or aeroplanes as I can see the flight path of aeroplanes coming in to Newcastle (you can visibly see planes ascending/descending) and the height. These objects could easily have been mistaken for stars.. they were that far away but you could make out they were changing colors red, white and blue. One of them was closer (but still miles up)and you could see it getting smaller and smaller like it was accelerating away. I should also mention the positions of them in the sky was like a large (I'd imaging miles wide) triangle. These seemed to hang around for a few hours and after a while i just stopped watching but I am certain the two diff items are related....I'd like some commentary from you in this via e-mail.

I saw the object(s) for about ten seconds, so the duration seen by the other witness is about 14 seconds). A v-formation with about 7 lights.  The lights had the same glow as a faded star, like the stars distant at the star sky.  The seventh light was completely still, but the six others where moving still following the ""main"" lights.  The other six lights (three under each ""wing"" was spinning sort of around, then shrinking to one light and then expanding again.)  I would say that the object was at the same size as a 747, or maybe bigger, and the lights were NOT blinking, they were constant all  the time.   I'm not a trained observer, but from experience, I know that this was something out of the ordinary.  Given the six lights and their abnormal behavior. The object moved south east, not in straight ahead, but like a weak half circle.  The object disappeared behind a hill (about 300 meters tall).  I would say the object was at the same standard height as an airliner about to land, and flying over the ocean.  According to my reference point, I would say it was flying approximately 2-3 kilometers from us. Note!  This was NOT an airliner.  Passenger planes fly over Oslo regularly, and they make a lot of sound!  This was completely silent, and way too slow to be a f. ex 747 which not fly in that direction anyway.

It was swinging like a pendulum and played hide and seek behind the trees. I ran in to get a witness, my 13 year old was my choice for his good eyes. After sufficiently freaking him out he went back to bed and I jumped in the car to go get a better look. It seems as if it knew I was watching,  as I was driving down CR 124 it was moving away from me at a great speed. When I stopped at the top of a large hill it was of to the west and much farther away. Continuing to watch all I could think was “what are they doing, surveying, taking inventory?” One minute it would swing north and south the next it would shoot straight up only to settle down to where it was. By 3:00 it was very far away to the west or much dimmer.

The date today is the 11th of August, 2008.  This was actually my 2nd UFO encounter in about the past week and a half.  I would first like to talk about my first encounter which happened about 1 and a half weeks ago.  It was about 9:45 PM and I had been at my friend’s house across town.  I started to head back home which was about a 15 minute drive.  On the way home I noticed 2 large lights about 60 to 80 feet hovering in the air, lights almost touching each other.  As I began to drive towards the lights I actually began to joke to myself that this might be a UFO.  I continued on highland drive and when I got to the Amort’s farming fields I clearly saw this object floating soundless in the air.  Other cars drove extremely slow past this object, as if to wonder what was sitting up in the air.  The strange thing was of the 3 or 4 cars I saw pass this object, no one stopped or got out of their car, but each car drove past this thing at about 5mph to catch a glimpse.  As I drove past this object I could clearly see the shape and color of this unknown craft.  It was diamond shaped with 4 bright lights on each corner.  The crazy thing was you could see these lights from so far away but when you got up the craft the lights appeared pretty small.  Also when I looked into this light it didn’t hurt my eyes as a regular light would.  As I rolled down the street almost directly under this craft I rolled down my window and heard no noise, at all.  Please tell me what can float 80 feet off the ground and not make noise.  The lights on the bottom of the craft are what created enough light to view the craft.  The bottom of the diamond was some sort of black material.  After passing the craft on the long street of highland I was only about 2 minutes away from my house and I wanted to get my brother and a video camera as proof to this sighting.  Unfo! rtunatel y when I arrived home he was gone and 10 minutes later when I returned the object had vanished.  When I got back home my parents were now there and I decided to tell them about this strange event.  On the way home they had seen this object in the Amort’s farming fields just like I had.  I figured out that they passed by this same object about 5 minutes after I had.  My parent’s first impression of the object was it was not normal and was a UFO.  They believed as they passed the object it began to move forward slowly but they never saw it disappear quickly.  The funny thing about this is that my family and I decided not to report this; I decided to report it after what happened to me, tonight, the night of August 11th.  I was over at one of my brother’s friend’s houses and it was about 11:15 PM.  I was tired and decided to head back to my house.  I was almost to my street when I noticed a weird light hovering, in place, a good distance behind the Warlow’s farming fields.  I decided that because of my recent sighting nearly 2 weeks ago, that I would park in their driveway and watch this red light.  I noticed that the object began to hover straight up into the air at a pretty fast pace.  The object reached a height of probably about 200 to 300 feet and began to move fast towards my vehicle.  At this point I was pretty much scared shit less and pulled back as fast I could and made a fast dash towards my house.  The object hovered parallel with my vehicle but essentially right above me.  I remember as I made the sharp turn onto my street I glanced out my window and up into the sky and there it was right above me, following me but still at an altitude of about 200 to 300 feet.  I could clearly see the lights on the UFO and the brightness of the moon made everything pretty visible.  It was high enough up that I couldn’t quite make out the shape but it moved quickly.  At this point I was freaked out of my mind and my adrenaline was running.  The object proceeded to follow me up my street until I made it to a lar! ge pass of overhanging trees.  I live out in the forest and there are a lot of trees that hang over my street, it creates some good cover from the skies.  As I reached this pass of overhanging trees before my house I was continuously looking in the air to see if the UFO was still present.  When I got to my house I was so scarred I didn’t even get out of my car.  I locked the doors and called my mom to open the front door of my house, so I could run in with no delays.  This event scared me to the point of reporting both these UFO incidents event though I had been contemplating revealing the first incident.  The thing about this 2nd one is that I was out by myself witnessing all of this.  My lights were shined out towards the UFO which probably got its attention because after about a minute or 2 it headed straight towards me.  I really thought this unknown craft was trying to do something the way it responded to me showing up and witnessing it out in the Warlow field.  The craft had 3 lights, 1 red and 2 white (bright).  This may sound like a plane or something but this was not, I know for a fact.  It made no sound, flew 200 to 300 feet above the ground almost directly above my car, the craft essentially engaged me and I ran.  In my mind I really believed it was trying to abduct me and luckily I was about 1 minute from my house and I went about 50 to 60 mph on a 25 mph street to escape this thing that was tailing me.  I strongly have believed in aliens before these events but I feel unsafe out here.  This is the 2nd UFO I have seen and unfortunately I have to pictures or videos to prove it, just the fact that my parents saw the first sighting and they strongly believe there was no possibility it was from this planet.  I’m now carrying a video camera in my car and will update this site if I capture or see anything else.  I hope my word and others will soon unveil the alien presence on earth.  P.S:  I just wrote this right after my 2nd incident with a UFO as seen above in my script",2008-08-12T00:00:00,44.586138873239435,-123.29192676056337

I first noticed an unusual glowing orange shape in the sky, perhaps a few thousand feet above the roof of the club, about 80 degrees above the horizon.  I then looked around to see if others had seen the object, and noticed that several other patrons were already staring skyward.  We began to ask each other if we were seeing the same thing, and if we had any idea what it was. My initial reaction was that I was seeing some sort of balloon suspended in the sky with a light shining on it.  However, I quickly realized that the light was being emitted from the object itself.  I felt very strange as I stared upwards in disbelief along with several others.  The orange orb appeared to be changing its shape.  Its movements during this time are hard to describe, but seemed to be pulsing. The nightclub featured many patrons with glow sticks and other flashing lights.  A DJ was playing electronic music from the roof terrace.  I began pointing at the object with two glow sticks to help others see what I was talking about.  At this time, it began to pull back further up into the sky.  The light became dimmer and it moved near what appeared to be a star in the sky, slightly to the west at about 60 degrees above the horizon. Over approximately the next twenty to thirty minutes, the orange glowing orb would generally move in a methodical fashion between several stars / planets in the night sky.  Sometimes it would move slowly and deliberately, while other times it would move in quick movements.  On one occasion, while pointing the light out to another individual, we watched as it slowly approached a star, and then made a semi-circle movement around the star, and then proceed in a straight line.  Based on my own amateur use of a night sky computer program, I believe that this star may have been Altair. I tried to take a picture of the object with my phone's camera. The object did not appear on the camera, however, an unexplained square orange shape appeared on one image, which I would be happy to provide if needed.  I did not see any square shapes with the naked eye. At least 15 to 20 patrons witnessed the same event over the course of approximately 20 to 30 minutes.  After I went to find others and return, patrons could no longer locate the object. The coordinates of the sighting location are 39.293' North, 76.611' West.

It was brighter and larger than anything else in the sky. The light would glow bright and produce a huge halo around itself, then it would dim, in a very slow pulse. The light, when glowing bright, formed elongated spikes of light above and below the main part of the light. I got my binoculars to observe the light closer. With the binoculars, I could see in the center of the light three colored orbs: red, blue, green, positioned in a triangle to each other. In succession, each orb would glow bright, then dim (not flashing). I observed the light until the dawn made it impossible. During the entire time I watched the light it did not move its location in the sky; neither vertical nor horizontal.

I gazed up at the sky and noticed what I thought to be a star. I realized it was too bright and it was moving. It seemed to be coming toward me (going east).  I then stopped to observe it because of its strong single light and the fact it seemed it was moving rather fast.  I live along the coast of Florida and it’s not so unusual to see planes, both private and commercial as we are within around 20 miles from an international airport. I have also seen many helicopters, even at night assisting in police searches. I believed this was something I hadn’t seen before.  I listened carefully, as I can usually hear the aircraft, but could not hear anything.  The sky was very clear, I compared the object to a star and it was similar, but too big, too bright and distinctly moving eastward. Within 15 or 20 seconds, this bright moving light abruptly became an oval shaped white light with a dark center facing downward and it slowed down, practically hovering. At this time it had been at least a minute and I ran to the front door and called my wife to see it. She concurred it was nothing we had ever seen before and we should call the police.  Instead I knocked on a neighbor’s door and asked him to come quickly.  He happens to be an avid fan of flying and sometimes attends the air force demonstrations. He as well concurred and together the three of us watched this object move laterally, slower than I had first observed. Now it was traveling south.  For about 30 seconds more it continued, the turned sharply west, moving away from us and just as the oval light had seemingly been switched on, it switched off.  Then it started moving at the original speed I had observed and we lost sight of it into the horizon, as if it went very far west.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,26.940044657534244,-80.13581534246576

I just wanted to share an experience that I just shared this afternoon with several of my colleagues. So I'm currently residing in Las Vegas, and today is just another cloudless day in the valley. At about 2:30pm PST, we went outside, my two colleagues for a smoke break and some fresh air for myself. We sat down and I gazed up into the sky as it's been quite a long day. While looking up, I noticed three VERY high objects in the sky. Too high to be planes or helicopters. At first my colleagues thought they were planes but then I pointed out the fact that for starters, they were in a triangular formation and NOT moving. Then a plane actually passed by at a high altitude, close enough to the crafts for comparison (and it was very clearly a plane passing by)...it became very clearly the same kind of craft as these objects. I wish I could've documented the experience but the objects were too far to bee captured by a grainy cell phone camera and difficult enough to see with the naked eye (a little more clear with sunglasses). So now my colleagues and I are all observing these objects in a triangle and they appeared to be glowing white. When I put on my brown, polarized sunglasses, it became clear that two of them were glowing a pinkish purple color. I passed my sunglasses along and they all observed the same thing. Then, at the same time, we all noted their movement. It was too far to tell whether the two on the outsides or the one on the inside was moving from the triangle...or maybe all three were moving...but they shifted from a triangle to a straight line where they then continued to hover at a distance. We stared for a few more minutes and then decided to go in. When we told our coworkers, they wanted to see them too, so (two minutes later) we took our coworkers out to observe and the objects were gone. I have no professional experience in UFOlogy, but as an undergrad, took a class on UFOs in which I was trained to be the skeptic. My first thought was airplane and then I realized that they weren't moving but rather, static in a triangle formation. Then I thought weather balloons, but their movement was too controlled, too stable. There wasn't a cloud in the sky or an ounce of humidity in the air, and nothing grounded to create St. Elmo's fire. An airplane had passed within the same pane of vision for comparison so it wasn't a plane. Normally I would consider a project from Nellis, but here's the thing--when the moved from a triangle to a line, the movement was very slow. It took us all a moment to realize that they were actually moving.

The skies were mostly clear with the upper clouds moving east and the lower clouds moving to the north.  I would guess the object was between the cloud layers. The object sat stationary for about 10 minutes.  It seemed to get smaller, and then back to its original size when we first saw it.

The brightness never changed during the entire event, even when it appeared smaller or slowly flew directly overhead to the east.  Just a very bright white light. At one point it looked like a triangular shape, at another point it looked like a baloon shape - could not really tell from the naked eye.  I don't know what it was, but a jet cannot hover, I think a weather balloon would have been influenced by the winds and would not have moved east at a faster pace than the clouds, and a reflection of the sun off a metallic object would have changed as it flew directly overhead and been more yellow in color.

Above the city lights, perhaps around airplane height or a bit lower, I could see a soft orangey-yellow, self-illuminated object that moved like a piece of silky fabric in the wind. It was very faintly lit, so it was sometimes difficult to see against the light coming up from the city, but I watched it for about 30 seconds as it moved into the wind away from me and then disappeared. A couple times I thought I could see three brighter lights within the glowing haze that moved and “danced” around each other. The flowing movement of the light made it appear to change shape as it went. It was not moving across the sky fast enough to be a meteor, and it was not traveling in a straight path. It meandered. The size of the object was large enough that at first I thought I was seeing a large bird swooping around, or a plastic bag blowing in the wind...but as I said, it was moving against the wind and it was self-illuminated. Afterwards I told myself I must have seen some Northern Lights activity, but I have never been able to see them from the city before, and the light was only visible in that one spot.

I took a few pictures thinking i got nothing  but found when i got home and enlarged them that either three objects that were yellow lights or one object with 3 lights was moving eastward along the rooftops of the south end of the square.   There was also on our way home a transformer blown up i guess, its sides were ripped open, this up on the power and light pole.  Id never seen one so damaged and took 2 pictures getting a fairly clear one the second shot.  Again at the time we saw nothing clearly we c! ould identify due to the glare of another light. on a pole close by,, but it seemed like something was hanginging out the side of one of them.   I figured since it all seemed roughly the same color it was just a shattered section of the transformer sticking out oddly.  but again after looking over our pictures in enlargement we found in this image a very clear head like shape, that had large black eyes , and a tiny nose and mouth, its skin seemed very close to that of the transformer, maybe more tan, also the head seemed very wide at the top and the chin was tiny. anyone seeing it would think it was looking down at us.  during that evening and two others of the same week we got photographs of objects at different positions over our town square, one very close to and in the same image with our courthouse tower.  It had a coppery color and looked like a curved shape with a red light mounted on it in the corner of the photo.  It reminded me of a fin.  Also there certain lights! that went out as came down the sidewalk, there order was inco! nsistant , and one was the doorway light to a shop i at one time rented.  3 lights in all went out.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,38.2509,-94.3105

She then looked and only saw the object hovering and commented on how bright it was.  As myself and her were watching it the light then emitted another light below it which was bright orange in color.  The lighted object then began to dance from left to right up and down! My wife became frightened after she realized the same thing I! apparently did and knew that the way it was moving could not have been a helicopter or airplane due to the speed and movements it was doing.  The object then dropped lower below the tree line into a heavily wooded area and I could then see what looked like several bright headlights shining through the trees.  As that happened I could then tell it appeared to be within a mile of my house.  I then called my neighbor and another and asked for them to come outside and see what we were seeing.  As all seven of us were watching it, the object then lifted back up very rapidly several hundred feet and disappeared.  It then reappeared across the sky for a few moments and “danced” as it did earlier for five to six minutes.  It then disappeared for the second time.

Blue, Glowing, Pill Shaped UFO  First, let me state that I have lived in the Gulf Coast region of Texas my entire life. The area is littered with refineries, but I know what refinery lights are and any other potential anomaly that they might affect. What I saw had nothing to do with anything related to the refineries of Southeast Texas. Sometime in the winter of 2007 or 2008, I took my three dogs out for the last time before going to bed. At the time, I lived in a townhouse.  There were only eleven townhouses, all in a row.  The fronts of the houses faced a two-lane road, and across that, a grass field about two hundred yards long.  Past the field, another two lane road, then a small refinery. When I take the dogs out, I go through the back of the town house, out the garage, and into a small field behind the townhouses.  Before even taking the dogs out, I felt nervous for no apparent reason. When I opened my garage, the nervousness turned into more of an anxious fear that grew worse.  At this time, I couldn’t see anything, but my skin tingled.  As I could see no reason for my trepidation, I continued walking my dogs down the small drive behind the set of garages.  The small dogs didn’t notice anything or act strange as far as I can remember.  But for some reason, this one time and only this time, I wanted to go back inside.  I was afraid for my dogs even. I didn’t want to be out there. I was afraid of something before I even saw anything.  And when I thought back on the incident, this fear gave credibility to what I saw afterwards. When standing behind the townhouses, obviously the field or refineries that can be seen from the front are out of sight. The night was clear, no cloud-cover. I could only see over the roofline from the field behind the townhouses. There was a vertical, pill shaped object sitting in the sky. I say sitting because it wasn’t making any noise, wasn’t moving at all. The object must have been large, but I couldn’t give a detailed size because I didn’t have a frame of reference to measure the distance. Like I said, I was looking over a roofline. I thought it must have been sitting somewhere over the refinery or in front or behind it. This gives a lot of leeway as to distance, so the size still baffles me. I can describe, however, that at the distance it sat from me, it looked about five inches vertical and about two inches horizontal (height and width). But without a distance I can’t discern size. I can say it ""felt"" large, but it didn’t move at all and made absolutely no noise. The object glowed neon-blue, the whole thing. I didn’t notice any other color lights on it. It was just one bright blue glow. I only observed it for about five to ten seconds. It was not going up or down or away or closer to me. And then, suddenly, and I mean fast, the thing just shot straight down behind the roofline. It didn’t ""drop"" like an object that would shoot straight up into the air, sit, and then fall back down to earth. It moved almost instantaneously. But I couldn’t see why it would shoot towards the ground. But again, I couldn’t see the ground below it because of my vantage point behind the townhouses. So after it disappeared below the roofline, anything else on my part would be conjecture. I did have an instant moment of panic like maybe it was coming for me. I’m not afraid of much in life, but I felt an intense fear. I made my dogs get inside. I looked out the front door window to see what I could see, nothing. I locked the doors and sat on my couch in silence with a revolver. I guess I was afraid that it saw me; that’s what it felt like. It saw me watching it, then left. I know it sounds silly and childish, but I thought it might ""take out the witness"" or something like that. Again odd, ...when I was watching it outside, it felt like an actual presence. Like it could see or was watching something. But that might’ve just been the fear. I still can’t figure out why I was afraid even before I saw it. I told everyone close to me, and they all believed it. I’m not a person to make something like that up, never before or since. The whole incident is a mystery I can’t solve.

This might of been in the same time of year as the Maury Island and Kenneth Arnold Incident.,Tacoma,WA,,other,,"Occurred : 6/30/1947   (Entered as : 1947) Reported: 9/1/2010 8:38:58 PM 20:38 Posted: 11/21/2010 Location: Tacoma, WA Shape: Other Duration:",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77568.html,"This might of been in the same time of year as the Maury Island and Kenneth Arnold Incident. Hello,   I sited a flame shaped like a welding torch; the flame was stationary above my head.  What made me look up was this pointed flame was making a loud roaring noise.  The flame began to rotate 180 degrees and as it did it gave off a very loud ugly roaring noise.  When the flame completed its rotation it then went clear across the sky from over my head to the horizon in the snap of a finger. This might have something to do with the Maury Island Incident by Vashon Island right in the area where I lived or the sighting by Kenneth Arnold.  The only way I know this name (Kenneth Arnold) is I downloaded an article last night on my computer. I am 72 years old now but when I was a young boy I lived in the Point Defiance area in Tacoma, Washington right by Puget Sound and about 5 miles as the crow flies from Maury Island.   One evening I was going to my next door neighbors and just as I entered their yard when I heard this noise above my head as previously described, the noise was loud enough to bring my neighbor out of his house and ask me what the noise was.  I can’t remember what I told him.  All these years as I have told friends what I saw and heard I have always finished the conversation with gee I wish I could be hypnotized and go back and find out how old I was. Well, last night while watching a program about USO, underwater flying objects the program kept flashing this person’s name so I tried to get in touch with him but he turned out to be an author and I was unable to e-mail him.  I wanted to notify him of my incident because it is the only one where there was noise involved.  So while on the internet I was paging around and found a site UFO sightings I say Asia, and as I paged down I found sightings in the USA, I remembered I always thought I was in grade school when I saw this flame, heard this noise then watched as it flashed across the sky.  So I looked in the 1940’s and lo and behold there was Maury Island staring me in the face. I opened the site and read for the first time in my life about the man, son and dog seeing flying objects while snagging logs for lumber and firewood.  Their incident happened June 21, 1947.  If my incident happened in or around the same time that would make me 10 years old for I was born in 1937.  If the noise was loud enough to bring my neighbor out of his house maybe others saw a strange light/flame and noise and called the cops, military, Tacoma News Tribune or others.  If I was 10, I would not have read about the Maury Island Incident or the News paper about the noise and flame.  Maybe Fort Lewis or the Tacoma Paper has articles about what happened that night.  I might be a person that helps substantiate what others saw.  Sorry it took so long to get in touch with someone. Also I can remember the pointed flame rotated counter clockwise while looking straight up from 9 to 3 on a watch face. It's funny if I would not of been from the Point Defiance area I never would of found this article because I would never of recognize Maury as being Maury Island which is now part of Vashon Island.

There was no sound of motors.  The object had no wings.  The object made a very sharp almost 90-degree turn to the horizontal and then sped south along Puget Sound at high speed and towards Mt. St. Helens.  I was very surprised.   At about the same time on July 4, 1947, a Seattle bus driver and U.S.Navy member saw similar objects over Seattle.   On June 24, 1947, a light plane pilot and a prospector saw nine silvery flying saucers flying in line at high speed from north to south  over nearby Mount Rainier and Mount Adams, Washington. On July 4, 1947, two airline pilots and a stewardess saw similar nine flying saucers flying from southeast to northwest from Boise, Idaho, towards Mount Rainier and Seattle.

Myself and about four other cousins where sitting in the back of my parents car at about 11:00 pm CDT in early summer.   We were staying in a little concrete cabin built by our grandfather.   This was a time when nothing was built around us.  Lake Ozark at its beginning.  Anyway...as Sam began reading from a book from flashlight I looked out my back passenger window to see a very large cigar shaped object come over the hill across the cove.  It was, to my best guess about 5,000 ft..  It made no sound, and it had several bands of different colored lights rotating around it.  It was moving at a slow speed and I wanted to tell everyone in the car to look.   To my surprise.. I couldn't say a thing...and just watched the thing drift over the next hill.  I guarantee you it was NOT a balloon.  It had a motion of direction and a lot faster than the wind!   Come to find out..the old settler that has been there for years had built a landing sight in the woods near us for these little fellows as he called them.   Everyone thought he had lost it living in the woods as long as he had.  I did see the concrete landing pods he made and to this day I'll bet there still there.",,38.148,-92.7448

To Whom This May Concern:  This sighting happened a very long time ago so you may not be interested in hearing about it now, though you weren’t created yet when it occurred. I have never reported it and for years have wondered if I should to add support to those sightings I read about. The year was somewhere around 1965-67 and I was sleeping outside on my parents deck in southwest Portland, Oregon with a friend. It was summertime and we were in our sleeping bags on lounge chairs watching the stars and chit chatting. . . All of a sudden a star, or what we thought was a star fell out of the Big Dipper. . .like from one of the corners and straight down. We both commented on the falling star and kept viewing the sky as before. Soon after we noticed a light that was moving in our direction, yet still out in the distance quite a ways, so we began watching it to see what it was or where it was going. My parents lived in an old established neighborhood which had lots of trees here and there, so as this light moved sort of back and forth horizontally across our field of vision, it would be blocked for short periods due to the trees blocking our view. Eventually, say within 3-4 minutes, this light flew around to the right of us behind a group of trees and when it came out into view and flew toward us, it stopped directly over head for about a minute. . . .This was a complete stop. It hovered over head at an angle and was no longer just a light, it now appeared to be a saucer shaped object, about a foot in length, and glowing like a coal out of a fire (the whole thing). After sitting there at a complete stop over our heads, it shot towards the distant horizon in a flash, within the snap of my fingers. Another interesting thing about this is later, much later, in about 2005, I met a young woman in a class down in Eugene, Oregon who had lived next door to my parents long after I had moved out, and she told me that she had also seen a UFO while living in that house next door, (not the same incident), as this young woman is much younger than I, and then she told me that the neighbors on the other side of my parents house had years before also seen a UFO and I guess had reported it anonymously to have their name left off of the report. I find that really interesting and makes me wonder about that particular area, and why would three completely separate occurrences of UFO sightings be had there (?)

It was not a satellite.  We were walking back from the [Fort Lee] Service Club one night when the sky was very clear and this very distant dim spot of light came over the sky following a definite course.  Ordinarily we would have known it as a satellite, but then we saw that it had a zigzag or bobbing motion rather than a smooth course, and twice it receded or faded from view, as though it turned outward from the earth, but each time it came back.  (It was a completely clear night, stars bright, not a cloud in the sky.)   Twice also it definitely changed direction.  Finally it receded outward a last time and disappeared.  We have seen satellites enough to know them and this was unlike any satellite I have seen.  It was about the size of a very distant star and about that bright.  Its course and motion caused us to question what it was.”  Additional facts:  The sighting took place in a large open grassy ground where the sky was extensively visible without obstruction by objects or ground lights.  While the impression of zigzag motion might suggest the alternating wing lights of a high-flying plane, the most striking feature of this sighting was the object’s changes in direction, which impressed me very strongly as being made “on a dime,” that is, without a turn such as a plane might make, but a sudden, angular turn, without pause, which no known plane or satellite was capable of making at that time.  These two changes in direction were substantial, not slight.  My recollection is that the first turn marked a sharp angle, that is, sharper than a 90-degree turn.  The second turn was perhaps less sharp.  The night sky had more the clearness of winter than the usual haze of summer, and the stars were shining brilliantly.  When the craft faded from view, the third fade being the last, it diminished in size as well! as brightness, suggesting that it was moving away from earth.  Again, this was not the movement of a satellite and my memory is that it faded in place, not as it moved across the sky.  In other words, its fading was like its sharp angular turns, suggesting an instant upward-and-away movement.  We never for a moment thought it was anything like a meteor as it had none of those properties.  It should be noted that alcohol played no part in this sighting.

It was a small sailboat, and we were occasionally rocked by big waves as speedboats navigated close to us.  We had sailed from the east side to the west side of the lake near Dallas Naval Air Station.  We then were working our way back across the lake, but by sunset, the wind died down to almost nothing, and we were somewhat stranded in the middle of the lake.  As it got dark, we worried that some of the speedboats might not be able to see us as they continued zooming around the lake. Around 9:30pm, I spotted what appeared to be a rather tall yacht coming towards us at a fairly fast speed (30 mph est.).  As it passed us within 40 feet of us, all we could see were several round and lit-up porthole windows facing us.  There was no headlight in front of it.   Although it was eerily silent with no sound of a motor, we were just happy that it had missed us and were more concerned with the waves that would soon hit us, and possibly tip us over.  We all gripped the sides of our boat waiting for the shock waves, but no waves ever came to hit our boat.   To this day we have no explanation of the incident, except that this craft that passed us defies any description we can come up with.

He said he had been visiting our family lawyer who had been a judge for many years, in his hospital room a few weeks before he died.  The judge told my uncle that he wanted to tell him something he had never told anybody because of the sensitive nature of the story and his being a past judge and lawyer.   He said he was out dove hunting in the woods with his wife and two friends just before sunset.   He said all of a sudden a large circular shaped object about 60 ' in diameter came over them.   They got scared and got in their jeep and started back to the ranch house.   A cylinder of light came down from the craft that was the same in diameter as the UFO and followed them all the way back to the house.  They never left the circle of light.   Once they arrived at the house, they jumped f! rom the jeep and ran inside.  The craft then came directly over the house.  The light was so intense, it actually came through the roof and ceiling of the house and into the room where they stood.  It hovered over the house for some minutes and then went away. The reason for finally telling this story is that there was no reason for my uncle to lie (he didn't drink at this time), and certainly there was no reason for the judge to make up such a story on his deathbed.

On our annual family camping trip near Chester, California, my sister, my cousin and I would occasionally see what we thought were satellites floating across the night sky. It has always bothered me that I have never seen anything similar to these ""satellites"" since then. After stumbling upon an online account of  ""black triangles"" I came to the realization that what we saw was probably NOT a satellite at all. In fact, I think is scientifically impossible for what we saw to be a satellite. So now, 38 years later, here is my belated report on the ""three-star satellites"" witnessed over the Potato Patch Campground near Chester, California in July/August of 1974. I can remember it as if it were yesterday--one of those clear childhood memories that sticks with you in a very visual way. I remember talking about it with my sister as we lay there on our sleeping bags, looking up at the stars and wondering what those slowly moving triangle of stars were. We have talked about this as adults, though not in recent years. The first time we saw them, it must have been between 9-10 PM, as it was fully dark and the stars were out. We were just lying there, looking up at the night sky when we saw what looked like stars formed in the shape of an equilateral triangle drifting overhead. There were three white lights, one in each corner of a triangle. I could not see any body or an edge to a triangle, just the three lights. What made them unusual is that they moved, and that they moved together in such a way that you knew they were physically connected. It must have been really high up, because the lights looked the same size as the stars, slightly bigger, but also slightly brighter than the stars. Anyways, it moved slowly against the other stars in what I think was a northern direction. The three unified lights would speed up then slow down along it's path and slowly turn or rotate around itself. The movement was very graceful, not at all like an airplane. It just looked like it was floating and spi! nning past us up there in the night sky. It seems like it took about 2 minutes before it went behind the trees. I can remember seeing this at least twice for certain, and probably more like 3-5 times though I can't recall the exact instances of each. I do remember that it became commonplace for us to see these that summer. I remember that we would lay out and look for satellites, and we were successful several times. We were not all excited about the satellites. I am sure a shooting star would have been more exciting. We certainly didn't think we had seen a UFO. We just figured they were ""three-star satellites"" (that's what I called them) orbiting the earth. But, satellites don't speed up and slow down, and as far as I know satellites don't come in sets of three that move synchronously about at various speeds across the night sky. In retrospect, If it were indeed a satellite, then it would have had to be miles wide. I have not mentioned this Black Triangle correlation to my sister. Though we have discussed the satellite sitings as adults, I have not discussed this with her in any detail within the last 10 or 15 years. It would be interesting if a third party could interview her to correlate the details of this story as I remember them.

This happened while returning to Warren from a day trip to Geneva on the Lake, driving my new, Miami Blue VW Beetle, which I had received as a graduation gift a few months before.  I wanted to treat my friends to a ride up to lake Erie to my aunt and uncle's summer rental house for a day of fun and show off my ride in the process. Returning to Warren that afternoon, early to mid afternoon, my car was literally slowed to a stop, turned around, and ""driven"" for me about 150 yards to a place beside a small lake which I recollect to be the Willow Lake area.  I recall it being near the intersection of Grand Army of the Republic Highway and State Route 45. The craft, if that was what it was, was very large.  I recall it being silver, but whoever was in charge of that little shindig probably had the power to make me think it was a giant cinnamon bun if they so choose.

As we walked we watched these stars and began to notice that they were infact changing formation, as planes might do. As we walked and entered the yard the objects got closer. Enough interest was genarated amoung the group that upon reaching the house we summoned the adults. What I saw outside of the back of the house made me a believer. At about 100 ft I saw a cigar shaped craft, about 100 ft in lenght.A strobing band of lights ran lateral across its underside. No sound,just light patterns.

It seems now is the time to talk about it, why now?, why you?, who knows. I was driving south on a summer night when all of a sudden, I felt like I had a close encounter with whatever it was.  At the time, my now exwife was sleeping beside me in the car, so she new nothing about it, as it was happening and when I woke her up after this event was over, she shrugged it off as a figment of my imagination even though she noticed that I was flushed and sweaty. What occurred was that I saw an extremely bright and very large light that reminded me of a locomotive train light just behind me about 50 yds just appear suddenly and it followed me at the same pace but its movement was so strange to me because it didnt fluxuate with the contour of the road and there was no sound as if a helicopter. I wanted to alert my wife but I felt controlled as if in a trance or some hypnotic mind control and the only thing I noticed was that I could only use my eyes to just look in the forward direction but I kept glancing in the rear view mirror from time to time and I also noticed my palms were sweaty but for sure this was all I was allowed to do, I felt like I could only keep my hands on the wheel.  I felt like it seemed for ages that this strange event was happening or maybe time was standing still or whatever, I dont really know, even to this day, its always in the back of my mind, haunting me. I also noticed that there were no cars in either direction until it was gone which also seemed strange but anyway the years have passed and I was watching the history channel and it talked of ufo's and strange sightings so I was compelled to go on the net and do a little surfing and your site came up and well now you know mine.  I never felt comfortable about talking about this subject even to this day but it seems like alot of people are coming forward, so why not I. But after this episode my life literally changed around me, it steered me away from the RF communications (New Products prototype engineering) and into the New Products or unusual products of Defense electronics as well as travelling into far away lands for Defense Corporations. It's funny how a strange experience can help drive you into different arenas or was I being driven by something else, but anyway, I have had a lifetime of experiences working in and around the unusual, which has lead me to either live or travel into 16 countries, why me?, but they are finished with me now and its only a matter of time before I fade from existence. Oh by the way, when I was around 15, a few of my friends and I were just hanging out late one night and we all saw what I can only say was a flying cigar shaped craft with no wings and lights around it travelling across the sky and we noticed it for at least 5 minutes but we just shrugged it off and by the way I went into the studies of Electronics after this episode at this young age, was it my choice or was I being driven, who knows?

I was in back left seat. While standing outside I noticed a dead silence and calm. I looked up to the north at some stars and as I looked to the east it seemed like there might be a cloud blocking all the starlight but then as I stood very still and looked right at the dark spot I noticed the blackness was in a very well defined wedge-like triangle. I told the other three to look at it and we all three tried to figure out the total absence of light in that one spot. After about two minutes we noticed that our chests/abdomens had a kind of low frequency vibration that kinda felt like it took our breath. A light from the front came on very dim then grew incredibly bright. It then seemed like you could see a front portal with some lights inside. From it's hover position that had not changed at all the shape started to move north very slowly. T! he light, like a trillion candlepower headlight kept growing brighter as the shape sped up to a fast crawl. After about 1/2 to 1 minute the shape was now moving north and slightly up it seemed and was going about 25 miles per hour which seemed like nothing since it looked to be about 90 feet from side to side and about 120 feet long. It kept speeding up to the north and we jumped in the car to follow until we got to Grand View country school and we could see a light out the rear of the craft after it had banked 90 degrees to the east and headed toward Tulsa at an unbelievable speed. It seemed to climb to the upper atmosphere and traveled in an absolutely straight line. We decided not to discuss this with anyone because we knew we would be ridiculed and we never really brought it up with each other. It was a clear night and it seems likek the moon was nearly at new stage because most of the light was from stars. The craft was such a flat black that it's only shape was the la! ck of stars. The air was crisp and clear and the absence of st! ars behi nd the craft made a very well defined shape. The low frequency reverberation inside my chest was the most noticeable effect of the event. The light that came on at the front almost seemed like a regular Q Beam that was powered by a massive energy source but it did keep an almost laser-like tightness. At about one mile the beam was about as wide as the craft. There was absolutely no noise at all from the craft at any point. The low frequency hum was felt and not heard.

It was maybe a few hundred feet or so above the rooftops of the homes.  We lived on a dead end and it was a crisp cool autumn day. Not too many people were out, other than those at our home.  I ran inside to see if my Mother had heard our calls and looked out to see it.  I fumbled for the phone and called information for Tweed New Haven.  Once I called I asked them if they had been receiving calls about a UFO sighting. He blew it off stating that it was a weather balloon and the lights that I was seeing rotating were a messageboard saying ""congratulations to the Yankees"" for winning the world series! It was at that point, a young boy and avid Yankee and sports fan in general responded ""  The Yanks didn't win the series....they're up 3 games to 2""!

This event occurred in the summer of 1979.  I distinctly remember that it was dark and that there was cloud cover.  My estimation is that it would have been approximately 22:00.  At the time, my family was living in the Millard community in Sarpy County, just outside of Omaha, Nebraska. On the evening of the event, my brother and I had been allowed to stay up late, as we were waiting for our mother to return from a shopping trip.  Our house had a large picture window in the living room (facing west), and our couch was situated with its back against the window.  My brother and I had been kneeling on the couch facing backwards, allowing us to look out the picture window. After several minutes, I noticed what appeared to be a bright object in the western sky, and that it was moving east at a high rate of speed.  As the object became closer, I noticed that it was triangular shaped and silver in color.  I also noticed that there were several similar objects, traveling in single file, all flying at the same speed and in the same direction.  Each object was flipping end-over-end, at a rate of approximately 1 flip every 2 seconds. As I previously mentioned, there was cloud cover on the evening in question.  The objects were all flying below the cloud cover.  They also appeared to be maintaining a very constant altitude, despite the fact that they were flipping.  I’d have estimated that the objects were flying at an altitude of approximately 2,500 feet and that they were roughly 150 feet in length. The objects were silver in color and were clearly visible, yet did not appear to have any lights.  Rather, their surfaces were simply illuminated, as if the skin of each craft was its own light source.  Their flight path took them directly over our house, so I was able to get a good look at them as they flew over.  They made no sound at all, had no obvious vapor trails or exhaust and did not flash, blink or pulse any light.  The skin, however, did appear to ""shimmer.""  The best description I could offer for this ""shimmering"" would be to take a very reflective piece of foil, crumple it into a ball, unfold and flatten the foil, then shine a flashlight at the foil, moving the light quickly across the foil’s surface. In total, 4 of the objects passed overhead, at the rate of 1 every 15 seconds or so.  The total duration of the event, from our first noticing the objects to them passing over our house and out of view, was about 2 minutes.  That was the first and only time that we saw the objects.

These lights hovered and followed along side the car at a distance through-out the time it took to travel the road to Marina/Marsh Bridge.  Driving towards James Island they were on the left. This was a long time ago, this was a very isolated area, with few businesses, few residential areas.

This sighting occurred while fishing in the Mississippi river , in the spring of 1983 , probably April, between one and two o’clock in the afternoon .  It was a crystal clear blue sky , with not even a wisp of a cloud anywhere.  We were fishing from a floating dock , where river pilots , shipping agents and river workers catch their water taxis to the ships.  My fishing buddy and I were using heavy tackle and we caught three large catfish that day.  I was on the westbank of the river facing east , and after casting, put my pole down , sat next to it , with my legs over the side , and leaned back on my elbows , looking above the horizon .   Shortly thereafter , I witnessed an oval , light grey object  - coming from Out of the blue sky , on my left (N) at incredible speed and bolt across it , due south.   The length of sky it traversed was approximately one and a half to two feet of space between outstretched arms. ! It was probably 45 degrees above the horizon or a little higher .  Then it disappeared - Into the blue sky , in a split second.   The total time of the sighting was no more than 2 or 3 seconds max - no wings , no blinking lights , no sound , no sonic boom , no contrails.  It had absolutely no resistance from the atmosphere whatsoever !  I immediately turned to my fishing buddy and asked, “Did you see That ?” , and he said, “ See What ?” – well that figures .   My location was several miles south of New Orleans.  It was very high in the sky , 25,000 feet or higher ? ,  and about the size of a BB or smaller,  at arms length , but clear as day against the blue sky.  It didn’t stop and ask directions, it was in a big hurry.   I felt lucky to see it , even though it felt like I saw something I wasn’t supposed to see.   It was either a black budget toy that could fly 10 times faster than a jetliner , in 1983 , without wings and that nagging - friction from the atmosphere problem , or ‘something even more interesting’.  This was 27! years a go but I’ll never forget those 2 or 3 seconds for the rest of my life – been looking into the whole matter since then , with negative results as to the whole Truth , but quite satisfied with a bias.  Maybe the Truth is too much for us right now ...     - Anonymous ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I told him it was probably a satellite and just as soon as the words left my mouth it changed directions and hyper spaced away.  It was at first traveling from East to West and then shot off North.

It was a small red glowing light that hovered around me for about 5 seconds.  It was floating about 1 foot off the ground. I thought it might have been a firefly but no it wasn't after looking at it closely.  Hand held lasers were not readily for sale to the public at the time and it was floating off the ground, not a image on the ground.  When I realized it wasn't normal, I stopped walking and started to look around to see if anyone else was around playing a joke on me.  But then again That's when I noticed it wasn't a laser but a little tiny glowing red light. It kind looked fuzzy but also not very bright.  It was about the size of a marble with a round glow surrounding it.   After about ten or more seconds of this light checking me out, It slowly started moving down the alley and took a right turn onto either myrtle or pearl St. it was the alley behind the old restaurant mai kai on Elm St in Manchester.  It scared me so bad after it went up the street, I turned around and walked the other way.  I haven't told anybody about this because I didn't want people to think I was out of my mind and in need of a doctor.   I'm not sure if it was fall or not.    It was late at night and I was walking home from the north end. I have seen another UFO at the Manchester airport but I think that was a satellite going by.  It was a red square object that was traveling in a straight path and going pretty fast. That one took about 30 second to travel the length of the sky until I couldn't see it anymore. I never knew who to tell about this until I saw your web site.  Years later on a movie I saw the exact same glowing orb that I had saw that night walking home.  That was on close encounters of the third kind.  It seemed really strange that the movie had the same thing that I saw and this was at least 2 years later when the movie came out. I would let a Dr put me under if anyone had doubts about what I saw. Another reason why I never told anyone about this.  Thanx! for your time.  Feel free to contact me if have any further questions. Thanx again.  ((name deleted))",2010-11-21T00:00:00,42.972094248608535,-71.45090269016697

I am 71 years of age ,.I worked in the used heavy truck, construction sales business. Self employed for 20 years. Retired in 2000. As I send this out for the public, I am aware that many will think me a nut. I think that some of the information  that I learned from this event ,may be of some importance some day .there was some snow on the ground .  This incident occurred at my home. The time of year was either early spring or late fall. I do not remember for sure..  I was setting in a lazy boy reclines watching TV.,. The chair was next to a sliding glass door situated about a foot or so from my right. I noticed something in the air outside, and turned to look. An orange ball of what looked like fire was falling down towards my neighbors roof. It was about the size of a golf ball even a little larger. My neighbors house is about 60’ behind mine, there is a 6’ grape stake fence around the back yard. Bushes against the fence half way up on my side.  Between the bushes and patio landscaping is about 50’ of lawn. The patio landscaping rose  about four foot at that time. The patio is connected to the house and is 15’ deep,the patio is next to sliding glass doors, where I was setting.  Page 2   Now here is the strange stuff. The ball was falling at a speed  less than is a falling stone. Quite a bit less, or so it seemed. It stopped falling about a foot above the roof.  The object turned directly towards the patio doors. It followed the contour of the roof staying a perfect foot or so from the roof. Traveling horizontally. It dropped down behind the fence. I lost sight of it. Then it suddenly  It appeared at the top of the fence, staying about a foot from the top. Then dropped to the lawn, continued across the lawn, again at about a foot. Traveling fast straight toward the patio doors. It raised up and over the patio landscaping,  again at an exact distance from whatever was underneath it. across the patio and smacked  hard into the glass door. It left a mark on the glass door that looked like a large cherry bomb fire cracker would leave, dark to medium black in color It all happened in seconds, I seen it hit, and jumped up, thinking the glass would shatter. After hitting it actually stopped in mid air for just a second, then turned a pale yellow.  It returned in an exact reversal of direction, traveling back over all the ground objects at the same level. It reminded me of a toy train reversing direction. It traveled to the spot on the roof then straight up, it’s speed diminished. It reminded me of a hurt animal, though it  was not animal.  , It climbed a bit the! n the fire was out .I am not sure of this ,but I  think I seen some smaller fall. As I was not on good  terms with that neighbor, I did not think  telling him I seen a  small object fall to his roof. There was snow on the roof and I looked but could see nothing.      The object was solid, from the sound of the hit , It was about the density of a rock.\  The fire seemed to come out about a quarter of an inch or less. It left no smoke trail. the fire came out all around  the object.  It was obviously guided. Important  It’s guidance could not detect glass. I think this is important.  The residue it left seemed to about like a fire cracker.  I still have the  door it hit.  I think this stuff is important ,because a lot of people see fire balls. This tells something about them.       ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the source of the report does not indicate that fact.

We both looked as if how is it that all of this traffic is moving and no one else seems to see this but us?  It moved so quickly we were lost for words until it left. It actually hovered over us as to observe. There was no sound. It had to be the length of a small home.

I travelled Red Hill Road, a less used route, as I wanted to avoid lunch traffic in town.   Just a couple of miles from Clarkton, NC I started to pass through a wooded swamp area that had been heavily logged. From my right I caught a glimpse of something large through the open areas and remaining trees heading from my right to left (North to South). I slowed down as I was expecting to see some large Military aircraft travelling way to low or thought it could be a passenger jet about to crash. When it appeared in front of me over the open road I was shocked to see a craft that was metallic brown, cigar shaped, with either windows or squares and a ziz-zag pattern around them. The craft had no wings and there was no sound and was travelling too slowly for any aircraft I knew of to stay airborne.   I know this because this was not a distant sighting. The craft was right in front of me maybe 500 to 1000 yards away and I got the best and only view I have ever had of an unknown craft as it passed in front of me heading south. I had spent six years in the Navy and had been discharged only about 6 months prior. I had seen the Russian bear, migs, most of our jets and aircraft in Grenada, Lebanon, and all over the world. Later my wife and a friend brought food to the power plant for me.  When they arrived they were all excited about seeing dancing lights in the sky, the kind that dance around then join into one before travelling off at an astonishing speed. They witnessed this in the same area in the swamp on Red Hill Road just after sunset that day.

I was in the desert wilderness of Saline Valley, just west of Death Valley. Daytime, sunny, high billowy clouds. It was a beautiful day. I was looking out with binoculars as we were nearer the rim than the lower parts of the valley so visibility was very far.  It is not unusual to see military jets in this place, even flying very low to the ground and in pairs doing dogfights.  Saline Valley is not that far north of China Lake Naval Weapons Test Center.  This time there were a handful of jets flying just at the top of the clouds, which were about 20,000-23,000 feet.  What made them stand out was the sun's reflection off their surface that looked like polished aluminum, very shiny.  It looked like they were doing dogfights, running in tight circles chasing each other while others were on the perimeter.  I stood still for quite a while watching through 7x35 binoculars nearly straight overhead as it was a really good display.  What really grabbed me was the tight circles they were fly! ing and the short distances they went before coming about and chasing the others.  I watched for a very long time before it occurred to me that these ""jets"" had no wings. (there was also no visible propulsion exhaust). The really fascinating part of all this is how my brain categorized what I was seeing. For quite a while it didn't occur to me ""ufo"". My head was saying ""fighter jets"". But the conflict was how they were flying. They seemed to be maneuvering like they were on the end of a string being waved around and that's why the circles they were flying were so tight and sharp. No jets in this world can pull the tight turns that I was seeing. The physics just don't support jets doing those kinds of turns. And they weren't going fast like jets would streak through the sky. They were dancing, playing with each other almost like fish would do in water, darting back and forth. They were staying in one little area of the sky. My brain was just this side of ""what the hell...."". There were little chunks of logic missing in my observation. The thought ""how can they be doing that without wings"" stayed just outside my consciousness thoughts. I've seen fighters and they just can't fly like that and they certainly can't fly like that with no wings. There was no internet back then in the 80s. It wasn't until I saw quite a few videos on youtube that it dawned on me these were the same type of shiny roundish vehicles doing seemingly impossible maneuvers. I was USAF 40 yrs ago and I lived very near AF Plant 42 and Edwards so I've seen a lot of aircraft.  What I saw that day were not aircraft.

I was walking across the Vassar College campus from my residence, Davison Hall, to a music rehearsal in the Main Building.  I first saw the V-shape formation of lights as I was walking near the Strong residence hall toward the Main Building.  It was nighttime and dark outside.  I'm guessing it was between 8pm and 9pm, possibly later.  It was a very clear night.  I just happened to look up and see a V-shape of white lights moving slowly and silently across the sky in formation.  There must have been at least 9 or 10 lights total.  I'm guessing they were about half a mile up, maybe less, maybe more.  I remember trying to tick off the possibilities and really coming up blank as to what I was seeing.  Birds?  No, the shapes were moving too slowly and precisely, and they were lit up.  Planes?  No, there was no noise and no other light.  Helicopters?   Again, not enough noise and lights, and the formation and the movement was too slow and precise.   I thought perhaps it was a military exercise of some sort.  I did not see a wedge shape above the lights or anything to indicate that they were attached to a! larger craft.  They seemed separate, but all moving at the exact same rate of speed.  Some of the lights would ""trade places"" from one side of the formation to the other and then continue as before, which struck me as very odd.  When this movement occurred, the lights moved at the exact same rate of speed as when flying in the V-shape formation.  The lights continued moving over the Main Building and disappeared from view within about a minute.  There were other witnesses - I estimate that there were at least five other students looking up at the lights.  Some of them commented out loud about what they were seeing, standing in the street in front of the Strong residence hall.  After doing some research, I believe that what I witnessed was part of the ""Hudson Valley"" wave of sightings in the 1980s, as described and illustrated recently in Leslie Kean's book, UFOs.

IN THE SUMMER OF 1989 OR 1990, NOT SURE THE EXACT YEAR.  IT OCCURRED A VERY LONG TIME AGO WHEN I WAS A YOUNG TEENAGER.  THE EVENT HAS BEEN BURNT INTO MY MEMORY.  I WILL PROVIDE THE INFORMATION VERY TO THE POINT, HOPING TO MAKE IT EASY FOR ANY READER. IN THE SUMMER OF 1989 OR 1990, MY FRIENDS AND I WERE HAVING A SLEEP OVER, USING MY FATHERS CAMPER WHICH WAS PARKED IN THE DRIVE WAY AT MY HOUSE.  IT WAS A CLEAR, WARM EARLY MORNING, APPROX 12:00AM TO 2:00AM.  THERE WERE ABOUT FOUR FRIENDS THAT OBSERVED THE UFO, TO INCLUDE MY MOTHER WHOM I RAN INSIDE TO HAVE HER TO COME OUT. THE LOCATION WAS IN DEFIANCE COUNTY OHIO, IN A SUB DIVISION NEIGHBORHOOD WITH APPROX 50 HOMES IN THE CIRCLE DRIVE NAMED ""LAKEVIEW DRIVE"".  IT IS LOCATED NEAR THE PAULDING COUNTY LINE ON THE BANKS OF THE MAUMEE RIVER.  IT IS A RURAL SETTING ON ST. RT. 111. A LARGE DARK COLORED CRAFT, APPROX THE SIZE OF A LARGE COMMERCIAL JET AIRPLANE,  FLEW NORTH OVER LAKEWIEW DRIVE.  IT WAS VERY LOW TO THE GROUND AND WAS FLYING (MOVING) AT A VERY SLOW SPEED.  IT LOOKED LIKE A SPEED OF AROUND 40 MPH.  IN MY OPINION TOO SLOW TO BE ABLE TO HOLD FLIGHT.   IT NEVER STOPPED, AND DID NOT APPEAR TO CHANGE SPEED.  I COULD HEAR A SLIGHT SOUND, NOT AT ALL LOUD, BUT WAS A CONSTANT WIND/FAN LIKE SOUND.  I CAN REMEMBER THINKING TO MYSELF, ""IT'S SO CLOSE I COULD HIT THAT WITH MY BOW AND ARROW"".  IT WAS IN A V- SHAPED FORMATION WITH THE FRONT COMING TO A SMOOTH ROUNDED POINT.  A SERIES OF LARGE ROUND, DIM WHITE LIGHTS, WERE ON THE BOTTOM, APPROX 3 TO 4 ON EACH SIDE FOLLOWING THE V FORMATION. THEY WERE NOT BLINKING.  AS THE CRAFT WAS DIRECTLY OVER TOP OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, ALL THE POWER WENT OUT. NOT A HOME OR STREET LIGHT WAS ON. IT WAS QUITE UNUSUAL AND CREEPY. AS THE CRAFT EXIT THE AREA IN THE DISTANCE, ALL THE POWER CAME BACK ON. THE POWER WAS OUT FOR ABOUT 30 ! SECONDS. APPROX 10 MIN LATER, THE SAME CARFT APPROACHED IN THE SAME LINE, FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. NOTHING HAD CHANGED. SAME SPEED, SOUNDS, AND LIGHTS. MY FRIENDS AND I WERE STILL ""PUMPED UP"" ABOUT THE FIRST SIGHTING SO WE USED OUR FLASHLIGHTS, POINTING  AND WAIVING THEM INTO THE AIR AT THE OBJECT.  WHEN THE CRAFT GOT OVERHEAD, ALL THE POWER IN THE BLOCK WENT OUT ONCE AGAIN. AND AS IT CONTINUED ON IN THE SAME DIRECTION, THE POWER CAME BACK ON. IF IT MATTERS AT ALL, THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAD BURRIED POWER LINES. I SOMETIMES SEE A UFO TV SHOW WHERE A CRAFT WAS SPOTTED IN THE ILL. / IN. AREA WHERE A V SHAPED CRAFT WAS SEEN IN ABOUT THE SAME TIME ERA. THE DRAWN PICTURES ARE QUITE SIMILAR, IF NOT THE SAME. MAYBE IT WAS A MILITARY PROJECT,OR  MAYBE NOT.  THIS IS JUST AN EXPERIENCE I DECIDED TO SHARE WITH ANYONE INTERESTED IN THE TOPIC. MAYBE IT CAN HELP WITH ANY LEADS IN PAST OR FUTURE UFO INVESTIGATIONS. CROP CIRCLES HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE PAULDING COUNTY AREA,  APPROX 5 TO 10 MILES FROM THIS SIGHTING. REAL OR NOT, I DON'T KNOW. I'M SURE THEY WERE INVESTIGATED.  THANK YOU.

It was very very quick when it did this....it took no longer than a snap of the finger to get what looked like many yards away from it's present position. We watched with curiosity, excitement and fear as it continued this for many minutes. I even went as far as flashing my car headlights out over the lake to perhaps get its attention, but never did.

I have looked for years for a report on this matter. I’ve never found one. There were no reports of it in any major (or minor) newspapers in Nevada at the time that the event took place. I have recently, however, seen similar sightings listed that took place in different areas, so I decided to place my sighting here. I was driving on Interstate 80, in Nevada, heading north, between Trinity Junction (where Highway 95 to Fallon intersects I-80) and Lovelock, in the Humboldt Sink. It was approximately 7 p.m. but dark because of the date. I was driving a Ford pickup. I was about 11 miles south of Lovelock on I-80 when I spotted a glow behind the mountains to the south of the interstate, approximately three miles away. The interstate here runs southwest to northeast for about 10 miles, so the mountain range, also runs the same direction. The glow would sometimes grow dimmer, then brighter, but always like a ‘moon’ glow. It was incredibly bright. I drove along the interstate, watching the glow moving eastward along the mountain range. No light appeared above the mountain range at the point, it just moved northeastwardly. When it came to the end of the mountain range, it curved and started moving north, still keeping behind the next mountain range. I kept traveling on I-80, and it kept traveling just below the top of the next mountain range. Approximately 10 minutes later, at Lovelock, I got off at the main exit, which I believe is exit 106, still watching the light as it traveled at the same rate of speed that I did. I got off the freeway and pulled over at the side of the off ramp. I stood up in the door of the truck and watched the light over the cab of the truck. I was approximately three miles from the top of the mountain range at this point. The light lingered below the mountain tops for less than one minute, then suddenly rose up. The mountains in this range are from about 4800-6000 feet in altitude, and when the ball of light rose up, it dwarfed the mountains. The only way that I can describe the size of the round light is thus: if the world were flat, and I was standing at the edge of the world, and the full moon was rising and taking up the entire horizon, that is how large this light would be. It was a lighter color than a full moon, but was the same size and shape. I cannot accurately state how large the light was, but judging from Google Earth and trying to estimate the size, it may have been up to one mile in diameter. It was certainly not much less than one mile. As I stood watching it, small lights suddenly appeared around it. Small blue and red lights blinked off and on, moving rapidly around the giant ball of light. There may have been about 10-20 of these small lights. I cannot recall exactly. But they moved extremely fast. Suddenly the ball of light descended back down behind the mountain and began traveling south, in the direction from which it had came. The little colored lights stayed above the mountain tops but moved along with the initial light. The ball moved, not rapidly, not slowly, but at about the same speed it had been moving during the entire time that I had been watching it. It traveled this way for at least one minute. Suddenly a bright light flashed, like a gigantic arc welder lighting up the eastern sky around the light, a bright, electric-type blue light -- and the ball of light disappeared completely. The little colored lights stayed for a moment longer -- perhaps two or three seconds, and then they too just disappeared. I have never shared this with the media of any type. There is nothing located on the opposite side of the mountain range. Farther east lies the old mining town of Austin. There is a lot of military activity in the area; Fallon Naval Air Station is located within 50 miles. Shortly afterwards, I worked with a man who had retired from the Navy and after retirement had worked at the military base. I told him about the incident. He said the military could have missiles that could act like this. But when I told him the size of the light, he became dumbfounded, and when I told him that the light turned around and changed its course, returning the direction from where it came, the only answer he had was “the military doesn’t have anything that can do that.” Evidently, the  light’s ability to maneuver in this manner was something that distinguished it from a missile. And there is no missile that could be this large or act in this manner. I have no idea what it was. I wish someone else had seen it. If anyone else did and reads this, I hope they respond so I don’t feel so alone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They looked to be a  mile or so away. So I thought it must be someone with lights on a  hill but the next  morning I looked in the direction that I saw the lights and the ground was flat for as  far as you could see. The lights were in a vertical position. So its no way it could  have been lights on a hill. Case number two, It was midday about six years ago my wife and I was on our way in the house. I looked up and saw what I thought was a balloon, It was silver But then I thought the wind was blowing and the object was not moving. I called too my wife to look.

I was driving a moving truck with 2 helpers in the cab. we were heading home from Bakersfield after dropping off a load of furniture. I saw a triangle shaped craft,at first glance I thought it was a helicopter crashing in a field across the hwy, as we got closer to the object it shot back over the hwy about a 1/4 mile in front of us off to the right side of the hwy.  Then it seemed to just hover for a couple seconds and then it came right at my truck (30 foot moving truck) I thought it was going to hit us head on. As it got within 20-30 ft it went right above us and over the cargo box, the craft continued down the hwy at a low height maybe 25 ft off the ground and went back to the field i first saw it in. we continued down the hwy as i saw the craft in my side view mirror I dont recall any sound from the craft.

About thirty seconds later an extremely large object appeared moving over the townhouse in complete silence.  The object was somewhere between 300-500 feet above me.  It was triangular in shape with a large very bright circular disc in the front of it and two smaller but still large bright discs in the back.  Connecting the disc was a very dark (almost black) center part of the craft.  It was on a trajectory coming down to land on the golf course.  The craft was enormous, my guess would be the length of three or four football fields.  As soon as it went out of sight I ran from the deck through the dining room, kitchen and out on the deck facing the street.   I jump over the railing and headed towards the golf course.  As soon as I turn the corner I started to think that this may not be a good idea.  I stood there for a second trying to decide what to do. I returned to the house and grabbed a paper an! d pencil and sketched out the craft at the dining room table, I wrote down the exact time, lack of sound and described the craft exactly as it appeared.  The one thing that struck me very clearly was that whatever I had just seen was not of this world.   Nothing that large could move with absolute silence, there was nothing that large that could gain flight in our world. I had a hard time getting to sleep that night and finally fell off sometime after midnight!   The next morning I got up with absolutely no memory of having seen a UFO or any other unusual thing for that matter.  The kids and I had breakfast in the kitchen, they went on there merry way playing with other kids in the neighborhood, I washed my car in front of the house and it was business as usual.  Sometime in the early afternoon, I was going out to the deck facing the golf course and saw my my yellow legal pad with a sketch and words on it.  The second I saw the sketch of the craft it flooded back to me exactly as I had seen the night before!   To this day there is no doubt in my mind that I had seen a UFO.  There is no way that it was a weather balloon or some other questionable object.  This was some type of craft flown by intelligent beings that had technology that far outstripped anything that man had created.  The memory to this day is so strong and the vision of this craft is so ! vivid that it will go with me to my death.

We had farmed the property for sometime yet we saw a bright light up by the property owners house. The owner had a small air strip next to his property where his son would fly planes. I asked my father had the owner installed a new street light because over the trees about 600 ft away his house was really more well lit than I remember. We took our time and was heading home as usual when we noticed his property was extremely well illuminated as we were leaving. I looked up in the sky and saw what I took to be the moon but it was clearly not the moon it was a perfect sphere of light on a cloudless night. I could see what I took to be a UFO. It made no sounds and didn't seem to move. I looked at it long and hard to check and see if it had any crevices or imperfections, there were none I could see.  I wanted to make sure! I was seeing it so I ask my father did he know what the object was and did he see it.  He said he saw it and didn't know what it was. We didn't stop and headed home.

I was 14 at the time, with 2 friends (the two were brothers) playing in the woods near our house, sledding, snowball fights..usual kid stuff.  It was dark by the time we were ready to go home.  We decided to take a different route back since we were on the other side of the ravine from which we came in on. This route would take us through a farm field, to the back of small neighborhood. It was a clear night, the stars were visible, the moon was not out.  The ground was covered in a good foot of fresh snow. We started trekking through the snow covered farm field, heading southward when we all stopped dead in our tracks.  Out in the distance well above the horizon was a glowing yellow sphere.  We stood there for 15 or 20 seconds, my first initial thought was it was an airplane with it's lights on, flying really low.  The only thing was, it wasn't moving, just sitting there like a really bright, REALLY big star.   This is where things got really really weird.  The sphere started to ""shoot"" out smaller spheres towards the ground.  One would come out from the left, once it hit the horizon, it would disappear, about 5 seconds later, one came out from the right, hit the horizon and disappear.   3 smaller spheres off of each side, 6 in total.    My two friends were standing a few feet behind me, I turned around and the one quickly turned around and started running the other way.  I yelled at him to stop, his brother ran after him and tackled him.  We heard  coyotes start howling like n! othing I've ever heard before, living in rural Minnesota coyotes were no strangers to us but these howls sounded like they.  We then saw these coyotes off in the distance running from the farm field we were walking through, into the woods/ravine. The sphere moved towards the horizon and slowly faded away.

It was in the spring, I believe in late April.  When we got close to a rest stop that overlooks Holyoke Ma, we noticed a bright star like white light over the city. At first it looked like a helicopter, and we only noticed it because we kids were in the back seat and looking out the window over the city. The ""white star"" then suddenly turned purple and began to do zigzag maneuvers we had never seen an aircraft do. It changed colors from red to blue to purple to green and back to white. There was only one light, and no other lights on it to suggest an aircraft. (No blinking lights etc). Just the steady star-like light that coninued to change color every few minutes.  My father pulled over at the rest stop (this was the one where the old Mt Tom sign used to be years ago) and all 5 of us jumped out of the mini van. We were not the only ones who saw it. Several carloads of people stopped. There might have been as many as 20 folks. We watched it moved in these zigzags, several times appearing to even move against the wind very quickly. It then vanished in an odd way. It almost appeared that the sky slid over it, as if a reflective cover was moved over the light that reflected the sky back at us. No sooner had it vanished than one of the viewers (a young woman) who had turned to go back to her car cried, ""There it is!""  We all turned to see that it had in the span of about three seconds, appeared behind Mount Tom with no noise that we could hear. It then shot straight up into the sky above the clouds and vanished for good.

I was 17 my brother was 18 and had just graduated from high school.  We had recently moved from the bigger city of Normal, IL to a small country town called Mackinaw about 20 miles away.  We still had friends in Normal so we would often go hang out in there on weekends.  One Friday night that spring after playing cards and handing out with friends (no drugs or alcohol were consumed) my brother and I took off for home about midnight or so.  Being that we lived out of town, we had to go through a stretch of what I would call country roads to get home.  My brother was driving and as we were just on the outskirts of Normal, I started looking at the sky.  It was a very clear night and a lot of stars were visible.  As I looked up I noticed a light that looked like an airplane light blinking however it was moving around in a very odd manner.  It looked like it was dancing around the sky.  It looked like it ! was jumping from spot to spot instead of flying in a strait line like an airplane.  As I watched this light, all of a sudden I saw a red ball of light shoot out from it strait into the sky.  I started freaking out and told my brother to stop the car so he could see this light.  He did and we sat and watched this light continue to dance around in the sky.  We got kind of freaked out and started driving again towards home.  At this point we were still about 20 miles from home.  As we drove on about another two miles, we came to a stop sign.  There was a large grain elevator just accross from the stop sign to our right.  As we passed the grain elevator, we looked up and saw a large Triangle UFO hovering about 100 feet over our head.  It looked to be rotating on some kind of axis and it had lighs that looked to be circling around it.  It made no noise whatsoever.  We screamed and I yelled at my brother to get the hell moving.  The rest of the way home, this UFO hovered over our! car at about a distance of 100 feet.  All I could think of is! that we were going to be abducted by aleins at any minute.  It was such a nerve racking ride home as my brother did what he could to drive while I just watched this UFO following us.  As we made our final approach to the subdivising we had just moved to, the UFO just kept going until it was out of our view.  This encounter lasted almost 25 minutes and I still wonder what it was that I saw that night.  I can only think of theree explanations: 1. Our government is hundereds of years more advanced than they let us know about. 2. Another country is hundreds of years more advanced than we are. or 3. We are being visited by alien beings.  Those are absoluetley the only explanations possible for what I saw that night.  This was not a helicopter or a plane.  I wish I could meet more people that have had an experience like this and to share more details of our experience that night.

It was probably fall.  It was quite a while ago.  Having lived in central Florida for a majority of my life & my entire adult life, I've seen many things in the sky.  I've seen weather balloons.  I know venus, jupiter, the big & little dippers, orions belt, the pleides, mars, and the moon when I see them.  I've seen jets, planes, blimps, and rockets.  Patrick Air Force Base is in cocoa beach, florida, and I've seen the jets taking and off and landing there many times.  I've seen the Blue Angels do their show.  I've been to the space center & I've been to plane shows at the air force base.  I've seen spotlights lighting up events in cocoa village and from orlando and disney world.  I've seen many many rockets take off.  I've seen the space shutt! le come back to Kennedy Space Center (from my yard) riding piggy back on the jet.  I saw the Challenger blow up.  I've seen satellites.  I've seen the space shuttle when it just unhooked from the ISS and both were traveling across the sky - tandem stars in the sky, so i feel pretty confident about seeing things in the sky.  I've been an avid sky-watcher my whole life.  I've seen the perseid meteor shower several times and i've seen quite a few falling stars and eclipses of the sun and moon.

I was facing east, and I saw a round whitish-yellow light pretty high up in the sky that I would say was the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length.  I figured it had to be quite a ways up, perhaps a mile or so, but that's just a guess.  As I looked at it, it moved, but not like ! a plane moves in a straight line and you can see it moving at ! a regula r pace, this thing just jumped to a new point in the sky, not very far away, but it ... ""jumped"" ... it did not flow along smoothly.  I pointed at it and asked myself out loud ""what is THAT?"" as it 'jumped' from one point to another, moving from the eastern sky towards the north. I kept pointing at it and turning to face the north - and it kept moving on towards the west in those weird li'l 'jumps'.  Not just left or right or up or down, but randomly it seemed to me, horizontally and diagonally and vertically as well.  I kept pointing at it as it kept moving around until I was facing south and then it was still for a moment and then ~~~ ZZIP~~~ it disappeared.  I've never seen anything like it again.  Of course I did not get any pictures of it.  I'm not real sure of the date.  I had looked and looked at the skies before this event, and especially since, in case I'd ever be privileged to see anything else unexpected, and I'm planning on continuing to do so every chance I get.!

I was asleep this July evening, and around 1:30 AM I was suddenly awakened to my entire bedroom glowing a bright neon green. The levelore blinds were closed, but it didnt seem to matter. The walk-in closet was bright green, as was the bathroom.  My bedroom door was open, and the hallway was pitch black. My boyfriend was asleep next to me, and I tried like hell to wake him up..but he wouldnt.   As I looked around the room, I thought I was going to see little grey men. There was no noise whatsoever. Since my boyfriend wouldnt wake up I had this feeling something was going to happen, so I got up really quick and ran down the hallway.  I rounded the corner to the living room, and glanced at the clock. I had heard of missing time and wanted to document it in my mind. The living room was dark as it should be.  As I grabbed the doorknob to the deck, I knew the green light in the bedroom quit.  There was never any noise, and Im not sure how I knew that light was gone.   I looked back at the clock and it had only been a few minutes..so I wasnt missing any time.  I went back down the hallway and stood in the bedroom doorway, and said my boyfriends name. He sat up and said "" What.""  He is a very light sleeper, and it doesnt take him much to wake up. I told him what happened and he thought there was someone in the house.  I explained to him about the green glow, and that I tried to wake him up.  He had bruising on his shoulder as a result of me shaking him.  In the morning I phoned the manager of the apartments and the Sheriff.  A deputy came out and took a report.  We determined that there is no way a beam of green light came from the apartment building in front of us that would be strong enough to not only penetrate the blinds, but light up the closet and the bathroom with no noise, nor would anyone know I was enroute to the living room to open the door to the deck.   It was a very frightening night for me, and not one I will ever forget.  I was amazed however that the Sheriff's deputy actually took me seriously.

We were headed to Yosemite Valley. We crossed the central valley in No. Ca., heading east of Modesto on Highway 132. We stopped in the Sierra foothills to camp for the night. Our site was on top of some high hills that overlooked (maybe 1500' above) the central valley floor, and it was clear enough that we could see across (50-60 miles) the valley to the hills on the other side. Settling down for the night, my wife, my son (7 years old then), and me, were sitting outside the tent looking up at the incredibly clear and numerous stars that filled the awesome night sky. In the distance (south & north) we would occasionally see lights from an aircraft. Then we saw this darkish object heading from west to east in the sky. What caught our attention was a small flashing light and it was headed in our general direction. At first it's shape was not clear, but eventually we all could see that it was triangular. It was moving very slowly and silently across the valley floor far below it. We watched this unusual object for maybe 10 minutes until it was above (maybe 5000') our position. Then it made an impossible maneuver: it reversed direction in an instant without ever seeing it actually change direction. That was a very curious instant. It was like for that instant something occurred that was somehow outside of time-space. I don't know how else to express it. We continued to watch this triangular object, as it headed back in the direction and path that it had just come, until it was no longer visible. One thing that struck my wife and I about this object that made it seem like it was of terrestrial origin, was the flashing strobe light; just like a normal identifiable aircraft has. I can't imagine that intelligent beings from some other location in time-space or from some other dimension, are going to have strobe lights on their craft when they fly in earth's airspace: like they're following FAA rules!  The most interesting part of this sighting was the direction change instant: other than that it  was boring. It moved so slow and didn't do anything, and it just became a “normal” part of what was in the night sky, nothing special, unlike the incredible stars. These type of UFO's are seen so frequently that although they fall into the UFO category, they don't seem like UFO's. They seem like a terrestrial craft with technology that isn't known. I've seen other incredible UFO's that create an indelible impression, but this triangle isn't even close to that level.

Almost as if at some point they had formed a tight triangle formation and were now spreading apart.   I really don't know anything about the orbit patterns of satellites, so I assumed at the time that it must be possible for 3 satellites to cross patterns with each other like that.

I noticed a very bright blueish/white light on, shining down from above the house, and in seeing it, said to myself, someone must have left the floodlight on out back. Then it occured to me, wait a minute, we don't have a floodlight in the back yard. As soon as this thought came to me, I was fully awake and in a flash I was, I guess I would call it, consumed or flushed by this very very calm and peaceful feeling and the blue/white light (LEDish in color) then slowly moved down from over the top of the house to the backyard. I watched it without any fear whatsoever. It came between a 200 year oak and the house. It did not pass behind the tree which was about 30 feet from the house.

I submit to you , whoever you guys really are this report of what I have witnessed. This event was real and I was with my girlfriend at the time and another friend . So the 3 of us were there and we all saw the same thing .. and honestly it was very disturbing. This event was on the banks of lake Michigan right there a few feet down the trail that leads off to the south of the lake front park in Millwaukee Wi. . It has been quite a while since and Im not really sure of the exact date but i think maybe Aug. or Sept 1999 I could ask the other friends of mine and maybe get a more exact date . Anyway I thought I should tell about this because I think we need to know more and maybe this account along with others that come forward will hopefully someday help to prove that these things are real. Well here ya go , I just thought one nite it might be fun to go down to the park. I liked to go down by he lake . It was a place I could kinda go and think and anyway we went down there . It was getting dark and I started walking down a trail .. that was really private property and we shouldnt have been down there after dark anyway .. but we were just talking and throwing rocks. thats when I noticed what I thought was a falling star streak across the sky in the east way off far away in the sky . as I saw that I said to the others , "" hey check this out look in the sky "" and thats when things became very strange.The light Id seen streak across the sky actually stopped and went back in the opposite direction. It was fast like a streak and stopped on a dot then after stopping a second. jolted again back across what Id say whatever 8 inches in the sky from that distance .. and it looked just as bright and as far off as a star..  The original distance that it was is hard for me to try and explain but I say , it was way the hell out there in space. So at that point we were all focused on this little light that seemed to zip and stop and zip and stop and as we were watching it , it became obvious that it was coming straight in a line for us .. I mean it was only like a minute from when we first noticed it to where this thing was right up in our faces ... It was there hovering like maybe 20 feet above the lake and like as close as if it was the house across the street .. This thing was huge it was like rounded and TOP shaped not a sharp edged upside down triangle but more smooth like an old style Top.. like the spin toy for kids .. but this thing was as big as like a couple of houses .. and there wasnt really a sound ,more like a hum a vibration that you could feel . And all along the top edge were like 5 or so rows of lights and these lights were very bright .Red,blue,yellow, and an eerie white like similar to those high pressure sodium lights, in that they seemed to pulse and surge and there were also lights all over the thing from the top to the bottom that pulsed and so forth .AS I looked at my friends on either side of me and said are you guys seeing this .. we were all just frozen our jaws fucking dropped to the ground .. I couldnt believe it . So we stood in awe there for about 2 or 3 minutes and watched this thing and then a very intense sharp light started moving and as it did it was like a beam and the thing shined right into my eyes. and immediatly I cover my face with my hands and thats when I got really scarred . I thought at that point this had begun to get a little bit to close and it sunk in that this might not be all fun and games .. honest I said ok guys fuck this shit I've seen enough Im getting the fuck out of here everybody for themselves ..I felt panic for real .. when that light shined on me I felt it was reading my mind and I didnt like it .. so I was looking around for an escape route should I go this way or that way .. we saw a light comming up the trail we came in on .. thats when I said ohh shit they are comming for us .. so as that light comming up the trail got our attention just as we were gonna take off up the side of the banks .Guess what it was ? a police officer .. he's like ""hey you guys "" what are doing ... and with his flashlight in our faces we say just out here looking at this UFO .. and he takes the flashlight and shines it out over the lake where all the sudden its pitch black and the thing is gone .. just ""poof ""gone and says, ""what ufo"". Man I dont know what the hell was going on but it seemed ass if he was in on it or something was deffinatly weird about not only the UFO but the cop as well .. anyway after running all our Ids and trying to mess with us about being where we shouldnt be and private property and so forth .. he let us go and we got the hell out of there .. So, thats the story .. this was the real deal and you guys want to know more I would love to tell ya .. I wish I knew what they wanted but I have a strange feeling that they were going to do something bad to me .. I have nightmares about it still .. who knows, It was just a total trip.. well also the 3 of us we just would look at each other and just shake our heads ,, Ive told friends of mine about this and I think they probably say Im crazy .. or just telling a story .. but this was no ((deleted--B.S..)).

A few years ago, my family and I took a trip to visit my grandfather’s hometown in La Madrid, Coahuila.  This is a small town in Mexico surrounded by the Sierra Madre Mountains.  About eight of us went on a tour of my uncle’s ranch where he raises goats for a living.  He is a goat shepherd and lives looking after these goats in the mountains.  We spent the whole day climbing a hill trying to get to the top.  It was about a mile up to the top.  It took about 2 hours to go up and come back down.  At about 6 or 7 pm, the sun started to set. There was still daylight out so we started packing up and heading back to my uncle’s house.  It was a long drive.  Four of us had to ride in the back of the truck so we had a clear view of the skies. It was a clear winter day.  This was during Christmas week because I remember spending Christmas Eve in Monclova, Coahuila the next day.  As we drove we noticed a white light right above the mountain top.  It just stayed there f! or a few minutes but we thought it might be lights from a car driving down a road so no one really paid much attention.  I was sitting facing the light so from time to time during the chatter with everyone I would look toward the light.  I noticed it started moving in a direct line as if driving the same way we were going.  I thought it was odd a vehicle would be driving so slow.  At this time I brought the attention to everyone else in the group.  We weren’t familiar with the area so we all thought there was a road on the mountain.  We asked my uncle and he said no, it is not possible to drive that far up the mountain.  We then realized he was right.  As we turned a corner we could see the light was not on the mountain, but hovering over it.  We all gasped and watched as it got nearer to us increasing in size.  At first it was so far away it seemed like white car lights, but as it got closer we realized it was one ball of light.  Like an orb, like a meteor.  This orb was t! raveling horizontally across the mountain so we knew it wasn’t! a meteo r.  It never turned off but kept moving at a slow pace as if trying to see what we were up to.  We tried recording it on camera but it was too dark to see.  This is the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen.  My uncles said they see things like this from time to time and other strange things too.  I don’t know what it was, but I know what it wasn’t.  This orb didn’t shoot across the sky and dissappear, no as we got further and further away it traveled back behind the mountain until we couldn’t see it anymore.  This was no flashlight, it had to be bigger than our truck judging from the size and proximity to us in the sky.  Very strange. I have no reason to lie or make this up. This is what we all saw and to this day from time to time we talk about it, not knowing how to explain it.  No there were no sounds coming from this orb. It was very silent.  We were in a remote location, far from any noise of traffic, there were no airplanes or aircraft of any kind in the skies.  This was about eleven years ago. I didn't know we could report these sightings. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I trained my 16 x 50 binoculars on the stationary object partially obstructed by billowing Cumulus clouds.  I was surprised to see that the circle was hollow and I could actually see through much of the center.  The outer circular edge had evenly proportioned sectional segments that were white in color.  I would liken the shape to a hollow style Frisbee. There were no lights, or other phenomena to report. I would estimate the diameter to be 300 to 500 feet across at an altitude of at least 30k to 40k, or perhaps even way higher than that. It would certainly dwarf the largest aircraft, such as a C5A.  It was completely stationary for the many long minutes I observed it with my wife.  There must have been others that could also plai! nly see it as there were literally thousands of people at the event, but perhaps were too intent on watching the aerobatics being performed.  Eventually, the clouds blocked my view of the object. I don’t think it could have been the rings of a planet. I don’t think planet rings could be seen by the naked eye.

As we were passing it I noticed a movement close to the ground. It was a silver colored triangular planform moving eastward at a fairly leisurely pace.  I can make no certain estimate of its size but it appeared to be fairly substantial. It took a left turn proceeding around the edge of a basin in the desert.  It then proceeded to make another left turn, maintaining a similar speed.  This was followed by another left turn that placed it facing a peak that anchored the southeastern corner of the basin.  As it completed this turn the craft appeared to suddenly accelerate as though launched from a slingshot and disappeared. There was no further sign of it.  I don’t believe it hit the peak, which, from my window appeared inevitable.  It may have turned edge-on, but if so the rate of rotation was phenomenal or it may have employed a cloaking method. I mentioned my sighting to the pilot later and he was not surprised and let me know that he had seen a lot of strange things in that area - none of which officially happened. I would connect the loitering plane with the craft. I was unable to determine if the Boeing was a tanker or perhaps a command post of some sort.

I was 21 at the time and the other witness was 18. Mid sentence one of the other actors stopped talking and started staring at something in the sky, I immediately looked up and saw what he was watching and we both followed it across the sky until it disappeared.  The object at first struck me as a low laying cloud as it was kind of hazy but it appeared to be moving quicker than most clouds would as the night was not windy.  Upon looking closer there were three rows of dull red lights.  They were shaped in a half circle.  When the object disappeared from view we heard a single noise that sounded like a goose honking but we did not see any geese in the area or in the sky. After seeing this the fellow and I stared at each other in disbelief and then described the exact same thing to each other, finishing each others sentences.  We kept an eye on the sky after that but nothing else was seen.  Neither one of us had been drinking that night or were under any other influences.

Our house is almost dead center in the middle of the field. One night I was chatting online and surfing the internet when I decided to go outside on the patio to have a cigarette. That's when I looked up into the sky. There was a beam of light that was circling, similar to that if you hold a string with a washer, used as a pendelum. There was only one beam of light. The sighting took many forms. There was a while where there were three crafts orbiting in a counter-clockwise fasion. They were oval shaped, solid (non-transparent), and bright white. They were 3/4 the size of a full moon. No other details on their cosmetic forms. The night this happened, the sky was completely clear. No clouds whatsoever, no visible fog. These crafts or orbs were amazingly fast, faster than any aircraft or vehicle that I know of, that is known to man, that has this technology. Before the crafts emitted the beam of light, the crafts seem to have multiplied to form a strand of what I like to call orbs, similar to that of a pearl necklace in an upward movement every rotation. The crafts slinkied up like this to make it look like there were several crafts (maybe there were) then returning back to one craft. Weather balloon, no. Too fast and sporadic. I mean these crafts were FAST when they were moving. Blink and it's on the other side of the sky. I seen the shapes perfectly, they were a ""perfect"" oval shape. They were silent. For some background. I live in the middle of a 15 acre field. I am reposting this because it's now Aug 19th, 2010, and I can't seem to find and answers on what I saw. Since this happened, I have been increasingly interested in paranormal events, UFO's, and other things of the sort. I have respect for those who try to debunk phenomenons to prove they are fake or man-made. It's how you find answers. Even though I have not really done scientific or physical research on my sighting, I have a hard time thinking it something fake or man-made. It was way too elaborate and extraordinary. I saw my sighting above the treelines in my field. The forest beyond where I seen the crafts travels a little ways, but then comes to another field owned by a farmer whos name I will exclude from here. Beyond that is more forest, and a few country residental houses. Nothing very populated by any means. The next morning (close to noon), there was a helicopter flying very low right above the tree-line exactly where I saw the crafts. Almost as if the government or a private helicopter owner was checking the scene out. As if they seen it too, or knew something. I've NEVER seen helicopters there the 10 years i've been living there. Just that morning. Even odder yet, about a week or so after the sighting I was relentlessly looking out my bedroom window, between 3 to 5 am, and that is when I seen something moving in the tall grass of the field. I had a pair of binoculars handy, you know, since I just got done witnessing the UFO's earlier the last week or so. I seen a creature. It was crouching at about 4 1/2 5 feet tall. It was making strange gestures. It's arms and hands were moving in almost a wave-like motion, like taunting. It was bobbing up and down a little, and left to right slightly. It was dark colored, perhaps a dark grey or brown. The most amazing thing about it was it's eyes. They were the size of grapefruits -- bright yellow, to yellowish-orange. I Never seen this creature before, or again. My reason for reposting this 5 years later is because I have now since moved. I wanted the full report to be known finally. I was younger then. It had typos. It was poorly written. It was missing much info because it was rushed. I still remember the incident(s) like it was yesterday. The details are still very fresh in my mind. It is VERY important to me to notify the new house and land owners of this incident. I have and still strongly believe there is something in the woods and field. There is something out there still. Either it's always been there or it has been left behind - or placed. Thanks for reading...",2010-11-21T00:00:00,45.5102,-89.2359

The cluster was very far away on the horizontal, perhaps hundreds of miles, and seemed fairly high in the sky – if you held your arm out at a 45 degree angle, it was higher. From this cluster, smaller round lights would shoot out in varying directions; from my position, mostly east and west, and in horizontal or slightly downward trajectories. At least 9 smaller lights came from the cluster. These moving lights could be seen traveling for distances of sometimes 3 times the size of the cluster, sometimes up to 6 times the size, then vanish.  The lights of the cluster and those moving from it were significantly different than the airplanes which were also present in the sky.  I watched it for at least 20 minutes, and then I went inside.  After about an hour, I went outside again, and it was gone.  I did not think it was a star or satellite, and the position was not one in which planets appear.  I do not think it was a constellation, as the round lights of the cluster were so close together, and because of the smaller round lights ejected from it.

The object was completely silent and maintained an altitude of less than 100 feet for the duration of the sighting.   The object’s shape was in a triangle and was solid, as it had an outline and blocked out the stars behind it.  It was very dark, with each point of the triangle having a rather dim white light, and in the center was a blinking red light. These lights turned off for a period of perhaps one-half minute, just after I moved my position to be directly under the object.  The size of the object seemed to be about 25 to 30 feet long from the front point to the back, and the dimension across the back, as seen later, seemed to be somewhat shorter.  It traveled very slowly (a human could have out! run it) on a level horizontal altitude toward the south/southwest, over pastures, a road and then a bean-field, for about one-half mile before I lost sight of it.   As it passed over the bean-field, I noted that the back end of the triangle seemed to be less than 10 feet high, and completely but dimly lit with white light.  A few times, the land below and to its left glowed with a soft white diffused light.  The sky just above the illuminated land was lighter than the sky above the object, but only up to the height of the object.

After about 2 to 3 seconds, the one trailing got about 5 times brighter for one second, and caught up to the leading one and returned to equal brightness. They were extremely close and continued a South West path till disappearing. The reason I believe it was a UFO is because of the change of the intensity of the light was directly proportional to it's speed.

I was hunting for either moose or elk. I had decided to camp with my stepson who was nine years old at the time and expect to be up very early to start walking towards the salt lick in the morning. We were getiing ready to sleep in the truck and started covering up with a blanket, light up a candle and have a somewhat uneventful sleep. Thats when my stepson noticed some lights in the sky. I quickly shut off the candle and started to move around to get a clearer view. I did not hear any noise and just started to watch very closely at what the lights might do. the lights were about 5 to 800 yards away and were slightly obscured by some brush. Seeing the lights were as clear as ever. I watched as the lights alternated colors and at the same time were alternating the amount of lights that were on. No more than five lights were on at one time and they were arranged! in a perfect pentagonal shape on the egde of a circle. The amounts of lights that were on were randomly changing and so were the colors. The craft made no noise and kept moving from the left to right and down then up and to the left then repeated the movement at a steady pace the whole time while observing it. The event lasted for at least fifteen minutes and no more than twenty. At the end the lights just simply shut off and there was no more sign of any thing in the sky any longer. I think back on the event and recall it just like it was yesterday. I can point to a location on a map and know that I was looking directly south. I can say that I was pretty scared and decided to strap my hunting knife back to my belt and load my gun. I was prepared to fight just in case something scary did happen.

I was outside sitting on the back covered patio of the house where I rent a room. I looked up into the sky to the southwest and saw a strange looking light that I 1st thought was the moon until I could tell wasn't as the moon was located obove the patio roof more to the south. I could see the moons lumination on the ground.  As I watched the light I noticed that it was moving slowly towards the direction that I was in and was getting larger. Its shape was like a shollow plate on the bottom with an inverted upside down bowl on the top.  After about 5 minutes the object slowly changed it course so that it was moving to the North.  I don't know its size but I would have to guess tht it was a few hundred feet long and possibly 75 to 100 feet high.  As it was going to the North noticed that it had a small red light on the top and a small red light in the ""Tail"" end. (south end) The lights were not flashing. I have worked at a large Naval Air Station for close to 30 years. This craft was not anything that I had ever seen before. It made no sound at all. It appeared to be lit up from the inside as a tube light.  It was not overly bright and I could hear some of the people in the neighborhood oustside saying things like ""look at that thing"" etc. Shortly after the craft started in its northerly direction, I went inside and told a couple of the people what I saw and we went out to the front yard to watch it. After watching for a while longer we went inside.  I watched the news that night and nothing was said about it.  The local San Dego paper the next morning had a small article about some some fiery objects in the sky the just previous night.  I did not report it then with my view as I figured it would probably be covered up some how anyway.  I just happened to be looking at this site on the internet for the 1st time and decided to see if the incident was reported here. It was. Let me repeat, only one large fat (in the middle) cigar shaped object was seen from our view.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

The sun was showing through the clouds and there was light illuminating a large rectangular shape that was below the low clouds.

No blinking aircraft lights or sound. I clean an accountants office in the Town of Brookfield at the corner of Capitol Drive and Lilly Road.  My son and I do the job together. I had to step outside and get some furniture polish from my van.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed some lights that appeared to be about 3 blocks south of me across the very busy Capitol Drive.  They were orange like the lights on a TV broadcast antenna.  The lights were stacked vertically exactly like the safety lights on a tall antenna.  I thought to myself , ""I don't recall seeing an antenna there before.""  At that I turned to take another look and noticed they weren't in a vertical stack anymore, but were moving closer together and lower down toward the level of the tree tops. I called my son outside to get his opinion about what I was seeing.  Just when he came out he was able to get a glimpse of them dip below the tree tops and we figured they were gone.  He went into the van and grabbed his little hand held video camera just in case they appeared again.  We then noticed the lights were still visible through the trees.  The lights then started to rise again.  They moved in relation to each other in a sort of triangle.  After getting bright and dim a couple times they suddenly disappeared. My son's video is on YouTube.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od637rz2U00  I later looked up on google maps where we saw the lights descend below the tree tops to see what was over that way because they would have had to be practically on the ground.  On google earth we found a swampy area near Brookfield Highschool that would is about 80ft lower in altitude then our observation location.  So the lights could have still been above the ground but appear to us as being at ground level through the trees. I originally posted a report on Mufon.  Unfortunately I'm not a member so I can't seem to access that information which included a video.  They called me back and said they thought the video was interesting but they never investigated.  I thought about going from door to door in that area to see if anyone else saw the lights but I figured Mufon would do that. When I looked up that date on Nuforc I noticed a husband and wife reported seeing the lights in the same area on the same date - same time.  Their location was south of mine.

We thought we might be able to see them at night, I believe we heard there’d been another flare-up even though it’d been about a week or more since the really intense ones. So we were outside about 11p.m., standing on their quiet residential street when the 3 of us, me (57 years old), my friend (about 54), and his mother (about 86) saw a jewel-like thing shining in the northern sky, somewhere above Montrose.  It didn’t move, it was very small, didn’t glow or change colors (kind of clear, actually) but very noticeable. My friend went in to get binoculars to see if we could get a better look at it, and when he did, his mom and I looked away at stars and lost sight of it.  When he came out we could not find it, so they eventually went back in the house, but I decided to stay outside and just look at the beautiful California night sky. I’d occasionally put the binoculars up to my eyes, and since I wear glasses I had to keep adjusting them, not knowing whether to adjust them to my regular eyes without glasses or with my glasses on. I finally just left my glasses off and began looking up, straight up. Suddenly I saw a V-shaped object moving slowly southward. It did have smaller V shaped designs or window or something greenish colored, but not lighted, more of a glowing, I just followed it for a few seconds, maybe 5-10, then tried to look without binoculars.  But I saw nothing, even with my glasses on. When I put the binoculars back up to my eyes, I saw the same type of object except it wasn’t green, it was an ORANGE colored V-shaped object, also moving slowly southward.  I have no idea if it was the original object, or a second one, or what.  Again, no lights, more of a glowing of smaller V-shaped designs within the larger V-shaped object.

It was quite cloudy, but as the clouds moved through the sky, you could get a perfect glimpse of the clear sky with all the beautiful stars behind clouds.  I was with my friend, she was driving that night, we were in her car when we say what we saw.  We drove to Leesburg and parked outside of an appartment complex, waiting for a friend to come out of their house.  The sunroof of the car was open.  As we waited, I gazed up at the sky, admiring the stars.  I even said, ""I love looking at the stars"".  Right after I said that, my friend leaned back to stargaze with me.  It was cloudy, as I said, but the clouds were thick and moving quickly over the sky, and through patches of the clouds we could see the clear sky perfectly.  The incident happened seconds after my friend leaned back to look at the stars with me, through the car sunroof.  Then these two amber/orangish circular things came out of the clouds on one side, crossed over! each other where the sky was clear, then separated again above the thick clouds.  They were pretty big.  They didn't make a single sound.  My friend and I were speechless.  It was so intense that my friend denied seeing anything and got very upset with me as I was very excited and repeatedly asked ""did you see that?!  Oh my God! You had to have seen that!""  She refused to admit she saw what we did.  She became very quiet and dropped me off at my house.  It was very strange and out of character for her.  I came down to tell my parents about it.  My mother said, ""oh it's the military.""  There is no way these objects were military.  The way they moved through the air was out of this world, They way they maneuvered through the air, it seemed as if they were playing with each other or something.  The way they crossed over each other.  I know what I saw.  I will be haunted by it for the rest of my life.  Later my friend admitted she had seen it too.  That is how intense this sighting was.  My friend couldn't even come to terms with what we! saw.  I t scared her.  It was quite the experience.  Now I know there is something else out there other than us.  I wasn't scared by this sighting though.  It seemed as though these glowing objects were playing with each other.  The crafts did not make a single noise! Not a hum, nothing.  And I know there is no way we have the technology, top secret or not, that can move like that.  My friend and I would be more than happy to tell you about it.  I could describe it perfectly and draw a picture to and show exactly how it happened.  We are positive this was not human, or at least not from here.  I never believed in ""Aliens"" visiting Earth.  I always figured there was other life out there, but not like this.  Now I know.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,39.12245205479452,-77.56384726027397

I live in town and our sky is dark gray at night, so the craft was visible to me.  Even though it made no sound and it had no lights.   It was the size of a large van or small bus.  It was blimped shaped sort of, but was not a blimp.   Please do not discount me for saying it appeared almost alive.  The back end was wadded & what frightened me the most, was that it had a flexible and moving feeler type object hanging underneath. I promise that I am being truthful.  The craft scared me sick.  There was something very wrong about it. It did not belong. I was awe~struck for approx. 30 seconds.  It was just passing over my roof in a southern direction, when I ran in the house to try to get my husband to come and see it. When I went back outside on the patio it was gone.  At the slow speed it was flying it could not have vanished from my range of view that quickly. I only took my eyes off it for about 20 seconds.  I wasn't going to ever report it, but only the other night a neighbor on the street behind us saw the same craft.  I never spoke of what I saw to anyone in this town.  So I know he saw what he saw and that his fear of it was as upsetting and justified as mine. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) I am the person who submitted the ufo report from Farmington, Mo.  I realize my report may be deemed a hoax, because I gave no contact info.  My reasoning for not doing so, is that the craft I saw is unlike any I can find in your sightings reports.  I don't want to be perceived as a nut for seeing something that creepy.  A black craft with no lights or sound against a dark gray night sky.  With a swinging feeler type thing dangling beneath it, sounds far fetched and unbelievable.  A nearby neighbor also saw it recently, but I don't know him.  I only know of his account, because my son was walking by his house secconds after his sighting & the neighbor beckoned him over to tell him about it.  The know each other through our local National Guard.  I don't know him and don't know if he would publicly verify his sighting.  I would also like to add that on seveal occasions during the past year low flying fighter jets, have roared swiftly overhead.  Horrifying sound. I don't ! believe they are suppose to have practice drills over residental areas.  The first F16 we saw & couldn't help but hear, dipped and soared above our town on the same day that New Yorkers saw & heard the F16s flying over the Statue Of Liberty.  Last year.  I never believed the explanation that made the news.  Something else was going on that day.  Perhaps what I saw was a government probe spying on people, or a craft being manned by drug smugglers from Canada, ballsy Russians or Chinese spying on our country or even a craft not of this world. Who knows.  All I know is that it frightened me to death  & I do not trust my government enough to leave my name.

My dad was passing over a railroad crossing and I looked up as we rocked across the tracks when I saw this massive object in the sky. The only way that I can describe this object was that it was in a shape of a chef's hat. It did not look like a weather balloon, I have seen these all my life and it was 5 or 6 times larger than any other balloon I have seen. It seemed to be a metal, but not a shiny metal. The only light coming from the object was out of the bottom of the ""tube"" of the chef's hat. It was illuminated as if there were spotlights from the ground illuminating the bottom portion of the object. I took a second to study it, and then I looked at my parents just long enough to say ""what is that?"" and then I looked up in the sky and it was gone.

I didn't tell anyone at school about this because... why would I risk the humiliation. I really hope someone can get back to me about this. I would just really like to know if anyone else has experienced anything like this. Something tells me it is a genetic disorder, because my father and his father have both been plagued by similar experiences; only mine have seen such physical objects. I'm not crazy and I know I'm not. I graduated with a 3.27 with a double major in finance and accounting. I possess a analytical mind and consider my logic to surpass most. I hope you read this in its entirety, because I promise it goes beyond my dreams.  Since 15 years of age I started experiencing sleep paralysis. Most of the time it was nothing more than having a false sense of the waking world and an immediate threat of being immobilized. For a while I didn't know if it was just a part of my dreams. This continued for 7 years or so. It happened on and off. I never tried finding a reason for it as my dad said it had been a family issue passed down amongst the men. I had asked him what his dreams were like in leading to paralysis. He, like myself, had never had one particular dream that led to paralysis, but rather a multitude of situations. My first clear dream that led to paralysis was of quite setting in my old neighborhood that I had recently moved out of. I was wrestling with my friends, the WWF way (fake wrestling), and we had just started a royal rumble. My close friends had immediately turned to adults with the same aging personalities. I didn't think twice about this in my dream. The match went underway and we all began to fight. I began to notice my opponents viciousness. They were all fighting with the vigor of lions and I was stuck throwing slow punches. Then somehow, I have no idea how, I realized I was dreaming. I immediately woke up and was immediately bound by my own body. It scared the shit out of me. Some time passed and I regained movement as well as a clear mind. See, during this whole moment of paralysis I was half awake... I was stuck in a constant stage of limbo (best way I can describe it). After I had awaken I walked around. I check my limbs and tightened them as hard as I could; I just ! wanted to recognize my strength. I then walked to the window and not even in the skyline I saw one ""silverish""  oval, maybe 5 inches wide as tall in the horizon. It moved slowly and then got bigger and then slowly faded away. This was my first clear memory of the night. Fast forward 7 years. I have had many odd dreams, much like this. All a different situation and different outcome. I don't always see the silver oval, but it still remains the only clear object in such situations.  I have asked my father about this and he tells me that he had not experienced any silver oval, but his father had experienced UFO sightings... thought not directly tied to his paralysis. My most recent and horrifying dream came to me about 8 months ago. It was the most frightening dream I have ever had. I was frantically searching through a medicine cabinet, looking for something. I was panicked and completely lost and then suddenly, like any other dream realization, I noticed something wrong, in the writing of the scripts. I immediately knew I was dreaming and at that moment everything went white. I thought I had finally begun to lucid dream, something I had wished for ever since I started sleep paralysis. Then I heard a voice. A voice that no sound on earth could possibly imitate, this was no Britney spears shit, this was something omnipotent. Something that transcended the mind and lingered throughout consciousness. It spoke no definable words, but I knew what it said, ""what are you doing alex?"" It said this with such care and malaise that I instantly felt paralyzed and soon enough, woke up to my most vivid sleep paralysis yet. While lying there, in my immobile state on my bed, I saw it a arms length away. The silver oval came up to me, it was as tiny as I first saw it a thousand miles away. I was breathing frantically and it did not waiver. It just rested right in front of me as if newtons third law was a farce. As with all of my other experiences, it faded as did my paralysis. I could be crazy, but I don't know. I haven't had sleep paralysis in some time now... I'm not looking to be contacted for questioning... I only want to know if there has been anyone else that has experienced what I have.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,40.11609390756302,-88.25995336134453

We were the last patrons to leave and the well-lit parking lot was pretty deserted.   As we were walking east, I an astronomy buff at heart decided to show my friends the constellation Orion, whose belt was directly overhead.  I was standing in the center with witness two to my left and witness three to my right.   As I pointed to back Orion’s left foot (from my viewpoint), out of my left peripheral (north) I could see a triangular shaped object with a massive tailwind.  The tailwind was more than 10x the size of the object; it caught all of our attention.   I began to dialogue with my friends asking if they could see the object and they both agreed that could. We all conferred that it was approaching.  On the northeast side of the mall complex there is a parking structure.   The object approached rapidly and silently over the structure.  While standing there, I asked if they seen a large black silvery (similar to Hematite) triangular object with slightly rounded corners.  They again answered yes.   The object silently flew over our heads covering Orion, the size of the object, the distances away above us, or how much time passed is hard to describe.  It felt close but seemed far above, I tried to size it as it was approaching with my arm extended upwards, and it was the size of my hand making the letter ""C"".   Again, I began to describe the object to my friends as it headed south towards the mountainside of Palos Verdes, CA (not sure actual name of the mountain range) and I asked did they see a red illuminated circle underneath the bottom closer to one of the points of the triangle.   They did not see the red light; the red light was very visible to me.  As it neared the mountainside we watched it for a while longer (not sure how long) and it disappeared before getting to the mountainside.  It felt as though this was possibly t! hree minutes longs.   A few minutes later two helicopters appea! red clos e to where the object disappeared, they were substantially smaller than the object and we could hear them faintly.   There is an airport east of the mall but this object vanished with us all facing south.  We talked about it for a while in the parking lot.  Jumped in our cars and went home.

When first reported I stated that the object was a football fields length away. It wasn’t It was 50’ from my house.  When I think back on this I recall feeling disoriented during and after the event.  I felt like my senses where out of whack. The object was about 60’ off the ground hanging just above the tree tops. I do recall the object was solid. I could see the night time sky – (stars) around the object but not through the object. There was a very low hum that came from the craft.  I use the word craft because that is what it was. It appears to be stationary and seems to float above the tops of the trees. Actually the one tree that it was just above is now dead.  This all came to being when my dog awakens me first at 4:30 in the morning. Thinking she had to go out. I got up and let her. I came back to bed and and she awaken me again at 5:35am. This time as I was gett! ing out of bed I noticed that there was bright ball of red light over the neighbor’s house which is about 100’ from my house. I got out of bed and went over to my bed room window. Now I live in bi-level home and my bedroom is about 20’ from the ground. Which looking at my neighbor’s house I can see the top of his roof since his house sits lower on the grade.  I raised the window and stuck my head out to get a clear unobstructed view. This is when I first reported this that I thought it was football field’s length away when it wasn’t. I taken notice of the multi-color lights on the craft which where a translucent red, green blue green, and amber to pale yellow. I listen for a sound from the craft and there was low hums that change in pitch but it did remain at the low pitch hum.  I remember that early morning because it was extremely cold out and no wind or sound. I live in the woods and it was so quite you could hear a pin drop.  I awaken my roommate and told him to come to! the window and see this UFO.  He did and asked what it is. No! w he’s n ot a believer and he tried to convince himself that it wasn’t but he was looking at the same things I was looking at.  Has he watched it he was in disbelief?  I told him to stick his head out of the window and listen.  He didn’t hear anything at first and I said just listen.  He than hear the low hum also.  He asked why is it just floating there.   Than he turn and went back to bed.  He was acting strange than. My two dogs where in the room with me and one was back under the bed and the other left the room.  I told my roommate too come back here and look. He did, but he appeared dazed and disoriented.  We watch this for about 5 minutes I walked over to the bed room wall and turned the outside flood lights on and off.  He than told me to stop and live it off and come back to the window. At the time an amber color light came on under the craft and the craft started moving very slow towards the southwest over the tree tops into the woods. I watched as the craft turn slight and ! it appeared to glide as it slowly moved over the trees tops.  I remembered seeing the edge of the craft which I distinctly remember being sleek, metallic, very sharp-clean, crisp edge to it.  I decided to follow it, so I threw my pants, shoes and hooded sweat shirt on, grab my keys and jumped in my car.  I noticed that I couldn’t drive to fast because of the ice that was on the road from a previous snow that we received and everything was frozen. As I drove down out the hills and to a clearing which took me about 3-4 mins. I could see by than the craft apparently picked up speed because it was way off in the distances. I would say about 2 miles away. Even though I was driving in the direction of the craft the whole time. I stopped my car and got out and I could see than that there where multi-color lights going around the center of the craft. I drove down to the main Hwy. but gave up trying to follow it because the roads where to icy to travel at a speed to follow it. I tur! ned around and went back home.  Has I got out of my car I hear! d an app roaching object coming towards me. I looked up and there was this white aircraft with bright white lights under both wings and a bright red light under the belly flying just above the tree tops.  When I first reported this I stated that it sounded like a prop plane. But I recalled that not only a prop sound but has a high pitch whine to the engine. It was moving I would say about 80-100 mph. It was a white plane and the rear of the plane appeared to have various cross sections on it.  I looked straight up and could see the under belly of this plane. It was only about 100 above my head going in the same direction as the craft that was seen.  There is no doubt in my mind that it was a military plane that picked this craft up on radar and was in pursuit of it.  I contacted the local airport the next day since the office was closed on Sunday to see if they have planes leaving the airport at 5:30 in the morning. They said no. they do recall that Sunday morning being no wind and cold. Which was a rare morning for no wind in the area?   I was told to contact HIAirport since they as a local airport do not have radar. I did and never heard back from them.  This is my second sighting. My first was back in 10/1973 on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. That craft was cigar shape metallic/ silver color with portholes. That I viewed at 2:00am on a clear Sunday afternoon with binoculars.  I heard a sound from that craft. It was more of a high pitch whine. Only thing I can truly say is they are here. They’ve been here.  The house that the red light was over as well as the antenna like structure that was hanging down from it with multi-color lights on it was my neighbor who shot himself 6 months before.

Within 5 minutes drive from Marshall we both suddenly noticed a bright, green light or orb in the sky, slightly above and in front of us. It appeared to be stationary and wasn't very big but within seconds it seemed to grow as if getting closer and/or brighter. We were both in awe, as this was not by any means normal. It was about 1.5 to 2 times the size and brightness of the moon that night. Not 2 seconds after it appeared to move closer, it took off. The large, green orb displayed streaks of orange light as it moved from the top corner of the driver-side of the windshield up into the sky and completely out of sight in the blink of an eye, with the movement resembling an upward swoop. The whole experience lasted about 6-15 seconds or so but I have never, ever seen anything like that in my life.  I am convinced that it was not of this! world, simply because it was so bright, moved with such speed, and even more so the way it moved. A hook-shape if you will, where, when it was stationary, it was resting at the end or barb of the hook and once moving, quickly swooped down then back up and was gone. That about sums it up though.

It was motionless and held its position from the time I noticed it until about 15 seconds later when it just went out. This was followed by a just as strange “Puff” of green light.

On April 19th at 1:30 A.M. EST in Progresso, Yucatan my wife and I were lying on the beach staring due north into the skies. Patchy cirrus clouds made it necessary to be extremely focused, as what took place often occurred at incredible speeds, perhaps hundreds of times faster than the fastest military aircraft. There were two large ships. Nikki (my wife) and I estimate that they appeared about as big as a football field, but we could be way off. One ship was circular and its contours were illuminated by a rainbow array of lights. The other was triangular, and emitted what we immediately thought was a laser-like light---a glow---that was magnificent. These ships were relatively stable in the skies. Although they moved in any direction at will and even appeared to change shape, what they sent into the skies was even more incredible. About twenty spheres were released by the ships and performed incredible feats of aeronautical engineering. They went up, stopped, went down, went left, right, changed direction. And then we were treated to something even more fantastic. One of the spheres zigzagged (like a zipper) from an altitude of about one mile and landed in the Gulf of Mexico, swimming distance to where we marveled on the beach. Neither of us has seen faster movement by a material object. At the same time, it was beautiful. After forty-five minutes (2:15 EST) we were more than overwhelmed and went back to our hotel room. Interestingly, the following day we met our new Shaman in the pueblito of Halacho near the Campeche border with Yucatan and he told us: “It is good that you can see them.” A fisherman chimed in. “Yes. Two years ago we saw one in the same place. It landed in the water and didn’t even make a ripple.”",2010-11-21T00:00:00,,

We were watching a police helicopter fly circles over the neighborhood.  As the helicopter was approaching us, we saw two fast-moving lights cross in front of the helicopter's path, moving from our right to our left. The lights were about as bright as an average star, and were positioned closely beside each other, like the wingtip lights of an aircraft. They were solid, unblinking, steadily-moving lights. There was no sound coming from them, at least none that could be heard over the approaching helicopter, although the lights appeared to be much closer to us than it was.  We continued to watch them move rapidly across the sky. I was thinking perhaps they were the wingtip lights of a glider or something, they didn't look like anything I'd seen before. When the lights were directly above us, they spun around each other once quickly, like the wingtips of an airplane doing a barrel roll.  Then they did something I'll never forget: The two lights appeared to ""unlock"" from each other, increasing the distance between them briefly, then they rejoined and appeared to ""lock"" together again. Immediately following this maneuver, they made a sharp upward turn and disappeared from sight. The total time elapsed between our first sighting until the upward turn was less than 10 seconds.  I have no idea what we saw that night, but I'm confident that it was no ordinary aircraft. It was hard to judge the altitude of the lights, but I'm pretty sure they were low enough that we should have heard some engine noise, even over the helicopter, as it was still far away from us. The only way I can explain the lights expanding and coming back together is if they were on the wingtips of a variable-wing aircraft like an F-14 Tomcat... However if this were so, I'm sure we would've heard the engines, and I just can't see any conventional plane being able to move as sharply and precisely as these lights did.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,27.460967103347894,-82.52932940320234

Sorry, word processor is not working. I was alone on an upstairs balcony smoking around 2am on a friday. I saw immediately above me (approximately 100 feet above and 150- 200 feet in front of me) a dark, very large, slow-flying (approx. 10mph), disc-shaped object (almost identical to the movie independence day), flying in a south-easterly direction.  It was making a low, humming (buzzing) noise as it passed over the house rooftop next to our house. In shock, my mouth dropped and I watched it literally become invisible as a wave of colorlessness enveloped it. I could still see the shape and outline of it, though, once invisible. Afraid I would miss the sighting's entirety, I did not alert my boyfriend who was inside only a few steps away. And since I'd seen other UFO's, but none sooooo low-flying, I did not want to miss a thing. I watched it melt away into the clouds at the same super-slow speed. The farthest I saw it's distance was approximately 500 feet away, still at approximately 100 feet up. I went inside and told him what I had just seen. Every night for a week we went out at the same time and watched for it's return. Unbelievably, the next Friday, exactly seven days later at the exact same time, the exact same thing happened, at the exact same place. The only difference was it was an additional 50-100 feet higher, at a total of 150-200ft up. I was facing it, with his back to it, and I said ""There it is!"" I pointed to it and he and I watched it do the very same thing I had seen only a week prior. We were stunned and I was only too happy to have had it verified by another pair of eyes. We watched for it and never saw it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2010-11-21T00:00:00,,

The objects were two, of spherical shape, and had a bright orange color which was reflected in the side windows of the car.  Because of all of this, many vehicles stopped along the shoulder to watch in stunned amazement.  They emitted not a sound and every 5 seconds there was a change of color from orange to red and back; and walking closer to the objects, there was a strange sensation--as if being observed by an extraterrestrial.  After a few km. we lost sight of the objects because of the press of traffic, but we were able to see in the rearview mirror that they were still immobile.

I saw it at first, to the left of me just barely visible above a house, a red ball of light that just seemed to fly through the sky.  I guess the best way to describe it's movement would be to imagine as if you just blew up a balloon and then let the balloon go to just fly through the air. That's exactly what the ball did.  My sister and I watched as the ball circled through the sky, hurtling in it's movement but still in some eerie way it's moves appeared deliberate.  It continued to move like this through the sky for about another minute, and then it disappeared behind some houses in the southeast.  Moments later, a woman walking by asked me and my sister about the incident, asking if we had seen it, and asking where it had went. I poin! ted in the direction, and she followed it off until she was gone too.  There was definitely something strange in the sky that night.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,,

At approx. 1:50 a.m. I was in my back yard playing Frisbee with my dog. After I throw it, it takes a while for him to find it because it’s dark in my back yard. Why I wait I always look at the stars. I have been fascinated by space since I was young so I stare up a lot I was looking at what I thought were two stars pretty close to each other (I know their far). All of the sudden one started to move. I thought it was my imagination because it looked like it was doing tight circles. Then it darted about an inch over (At least that’s what it looked like from my vantage point ). Then it started doing bigger misshapen circles(as in not perfectly round). While it did these crazy maneuvers it moved very quickly, what looked to me as about a foot. I quickly ran about 25 feet inside to get my phone, which has a camcorder on it. I also wanted to text my sister because when I yelled for her she didn’t answer. By the time I got back out I couldn’t see it. I looked very hard at the ! sky and think I may have seen a much darker light doing the same impossible maneuvers. This I couldn’t swear that I was really seeing because it was faint enough to maybe be my eyes playing tricks, but the first light was as bright as any star in the sky on the clearest of nights. I was completely sober. I did drink two beers, but it was over the course of two baseball games. They were the ALDS and NLDS. I know technically that’s not completely sober, but I didn’t feel any affects of the alcohol. I am willing to submit to any test at any time. I don’t know if it was an alien UFO but I definitely saw what I have described here. Unless there was a test of an incredible new secret plane, This was too fast and maneuverable to be explained as any normal plane. I would love to have this investigated. I don’t know how it could other than observation that is recorded of the area it happened in. Like I said though I will take a test that this is exactly what I saw, and I’ll guarantee I pass No question. At anytime I am willing to take any test i.e. lie detector, vision, sanity. There was a lot of thin cloud coverage, but you could see through most and they were moving relatively quickly. I did notice that when they passed over stars and did block them for a second as they reappeared they looked like they were moving in the opposite direction of the clouds. However, This was easy to determine that they weren’t moving it was just an illusion. The actual stars were always in the same spot when I focused on them and this thing I saw was bright as a star and left no doubt that it was moving. It also disappeared.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,41.1312,-74.3674

The object was metallic, unlike an airplane but of similar size to a small plane. It was also illuminated by lights (non-blinking) and traveled at very high speeds. We observed briefly believing the trajectory and speed meant it was about to crash but realized it never did and disappeared once dipping below tree top distance into a wooded area. The area where this was observed is within 1.5 miles from our home and one we are very familiar with. In addition, both my wife and I are very familiar with small private planes and military aircraft that use local airports.  This object was distinctly different and beyond our ability to explain.

We live in Morris, Il, south of the Illinois River in the country.   Our backyard faces to the direct north.  It was approximately 2pm or so and I heard an airplane motor above and to the east. At about a 45degree angle east, southeast, I saw clearly an object best described as 3 large round spheres.  Each appeared very large, about the size or larger that my out building which is 42’ x 36’x18’.  The 3 spheres appeared all connected mechanically and hovered in an upright tri-angle position.   I pointed this object out to my daughter who is 11 years old.  I would of estimated the distance of the object at less that 500 yards horizontally at a height of less that 1000 ft. We both were observing it and as I stated earlier I heard the sound of an airplane motor in that general direction.  Beyond this object a airplane was observed traveling in a west, southwest direction and eventually could no longer be heard.  We watched the object for what seemed like minutes and we both noted that no sound could be heard. Suddenly the object started moving in a direct northerly direction.  As it moved north its elevation increased as did the speed.  Within seconds the object went from a southeast position from our house to due north and disappearing.  It’s acceleration wasn’t instant but the velocity kept increasing to what seemed a unbelievable rate.  I have experience with aircraft and high rate acceleration and can say I’ve never seen this kind of acceleration before. When the object disappeared I instantly told my daughter, ""Don’t say anything yet but draw a picture of what you just saw and I will to.""   We both drew the exact same object on the pool top with our wet fingers.  We both then explained to each other what it was we thought we just saw or observed. Of all the UFO reports we’ve read about and pictures and drawings we’ve seen on the net, this was the first that I’ve seen or heard about that was described as 3 large spheres connected in a tri-angle shape.

I started getting a bad feeling and said we should go so we continued driving down the road when (and this is the part where i swear i'm not crazy, we both saw exactly the same thing) three lights in a row came out of nowhere and started coming directly towards us.

I was near tears when we got to the main road and once we got there he tried to say it could have been another plane, so I insisted we go to the airport, once there he went in and talked to a sheriff and airport worker who said that the only flight that came in was from Chicago, this all happened before 8:30pm. We then concluded that there was no way it could have been a plane, (my boyfriend is very rational and level-headed) after the airport he told me that while we were driving, whatever had been in front of us was driving directly next to us less than a quarter mile away, he got a vague look at it and said it had no wings or tail.

I went straight through the center of town and down South Main St., heading towards her street when I noticed a bright orange light in the sky, over the street on the right side of the road, just to the left of and slightly above the trees lining parts of the street.  I laughed and mentioned it to her, joking that maybe it was one of my dad's meteors (my dad had come home from work that night complaining that he had wanted to watch the meteors but it was too cloudy to see anything).  I also jokingly asked if she thought the insurance would cover it if it hit the car because it appeared to be descending fairly quickly.  I asked her if it looked like it was coming down and she said it sure did.  It was orange, similar in size and color to some of the street lamps in town but it was, at first, higher in the sky than the street lamps.  And as it got wat I believe to be lower, it also got slightly bigger. This friend and I have seen strange things in the past, one of which I also have reported to NUFORC (11/1/95, Randolph, ""Light appears over power lines"").  And this was in the same area.  So I decided to drive down the same street we saw the other light.  Partly because I wanted to see if there may have been others by those power lines again and partly because I wanted to get off the main road so I could stop safely.  So I took a right and quick left to a parallel street and we still saw the light (so at this point I can be sure it was not a street light - with the trees and houses between the two streets it would be impossible).  I stopped the car in the middle of the street and we watched as the object got a bit lower and then turned sharply to our left (object's right).  At that point, my friend said, somewhat disappointed, ""Oh, I think it's a plane."" And it kind of looked like airplane lights then, because the orange light had ""gone out"" as it turned and was replaced by ! 2 or 3 white lights, and it was traveling horizontally to our left instead of down.  Then, it turned again, sharply, heading away from us, going either back (kind of West, the direction we had been heading and were aimed at) or up, I couldn't really tell but it was moving.  So I started driving towards the end of the street, intending to get back on the main road to follow the object.  I had to take a left and then a quick right to get back the way we had been before (S. Main St. again) and I was driving as fast as I safely could because we lost sight of it.  When we got on the main road it was nowhere to be seen.  My friend had her face up against the windshield, trying to look up and around and neither of us could see anything.  I drove up the street a way and pulled into a parking lot and we looked.  Nothing anywhere.  And it was dead quiet too.  I got back on the road and drive my friend home (we had passed her house in our efforts to follow this thing).  I got out of t! he car at her house to look around a bit more but there was st! ill noth ing. It was not a helicopter because a helicopter that close would have made noise and there was no noise.  And it did not maneuver like any airplane I have ever seen though when it ""became"" the white lights, it did kind of resemble airplane lights.  But the orange light was nothing I have seen on an airplane and we literally watched it go from one large orange light to 2 or 3 smaller white lights.  It definitely wasn't a meteor because of the movement (unless meteors change direction abruptly twice in the span of seconds and change looks the way I described). My friend and I are both in our 30's and were not drinking or on drugs.  I have never seen anything like this in my life (compared to this, my previous encounter seems mild, though in the end both objects took off in the same direction; I am unable to get the link for my previous sighting to work, though, not sure why).  I'd be glad to provide more details if needed.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,42.1696,-71.0606

I ONCE WONDERED  It was that story on the History Channel about the “rods” found by cameras. It was 1994 and Jose Escamilla's story was big news. While filming parachutists jumping into a deep, vertical cave near San Luis Potosi, Mexico, Mark Lichtle who is a professional cameraman noticed the rods when playing back his film in slow motion. Lichtle saw numerous rods darting in and out of the frame and flying around the base jumpers as they fell through the air.  Articles you may read will say the rods have been found in every country, in different geological areas from swamps to deserts, and I know they are in Idaho.  If you read anything that says they do not exist, just ignore those people. Not too long ago a local business caught fire. It was a pallet refurbishing company so the fire was great. We heard the sirens and went out on the porch looking south. Using Google Earth ™, the distance from our house to the wall of smoke was 920 feet. The burning pallets were just to the right (or west) of our line of sight. The wind was blowing due east at about 15 mph. Since it was late evening and dark, the smoke was well lighted from the burning wood. While we watched, something plowed through the burning embers and smoke from the west at a great speed and vanished once it was out of the smoke to the east. The object was traveling fast, but not so fast that we couldn’t see it. Once again, using Google Earth ™ to make angular measurements, determine distances, and where the travel of the object was located, I came up with these facts. The Rod was traveling from west to east at a distance from us of 920 feet. We saw it for three seconds. It was traveling at about 50 mph. My guess is, and it makes sense, the rods travel much faster in the sunlight than in the dark. The Rod was about 10 feet long and was a cylinder at about one foot diameter and with rounded blunt ends. It clearly had three sets of fins. They were not wings but had more the appearance of vibrating fins, one set within a foot of each end and one set in the middle. The Rod appeared from the right side of our view and on the left side of our view the smoke dimmed and was rising more vertically. The Rod was clearly distorting the smoke as it passed through it, and staying level at about 40 feet off the ground. The Rod exited the smoke and vanished. Without the smoke it was entirely invisi! ble. It flew level and with a constant speed. My wife and I spend many nights in our chairs outside looking at the stars. At no time have we ever seen a Rod, but I think now they are there. Sighting location: 43º 43’ 16” N , 116º 42’ 43.5 W or 4.6 miles NNW of Caldwell, ID.

Explanation of Events:  Note: This report includes two sightings exactly one week apart from each other in the same location within about 3-5 miles. Have video and pics for the second sighting. Noticed multiple smaller white oval objects after downloading pics to my computer. On Saturday August 14th at around 5:30pm while floating on my back in the swimming pool looking straight up at the sky, my wife and I observed two bright “star-like” objects directly above us. I have always been interested and have observed/studied different aircraft and can usually make out what kind of aircraft in is in the sky.  One of the objects stayed stationary in the sky while the other was moving at a relatively slower speed (and very smoothly through the air) than a typical jet type passenger aircraft and heading south. The moving object seemed to disappear or I just lost visual sight of it after about 5 minutes. The object would speed up and slow down during the 5 minutes of observation. After losing sight of the first moving object, I looked back at the other object and it was still motionless in the sky. It appeared to be a star (Which was strange considering stars are not usually visual during this time of day with the sun still shinning bright) because it was so still in the sky. After what seemed to be 2 minutes, this second object began to move south in the sky as well about the same speed as the first. This object would also speed up then slow down and make slight turns while ultimately keeping a flight path towards the south. After losing sight of this object because of trees, my wife and I went to sit in the spa. Almost immediately after getting into the spa I noticed the object out of the left corner of my eye towards the east of me and was heading north. It seemed the object had made a complete 180 degree turn. The object was a little lower in the sky towards the horizon and was much bigger at this point. It seemed to be a white sphere that was sh! inning bright in the sky. After observing the object heading north for about 5 minutes, we again lost sight of it because of trees obstructing our view.

Exactly one week later at 12:00 noon on Saturday August 21, 2010 while walking out to my vehicle, I noticed the same type of bright white “star-like” “orb” object in the distance northern sky (Altitude, size of the object, and distance unknown). I immediately ran into the house to grab my camera and told my wife to come out in order to confirm what I was seeing. She did confirm seeing the object in the sky and I was able to record a video of it as well as take some pictures. Also, something strange happened when I uploaded the pics of the object to my computer. When I zoomed into the object, I noticed many more of these strange ""White Balls.” These other objects were smaller, but I believe this was due to being further away.

Pictues & Video Available Note: This report includes two sightings exactly one week apart from each other in the same location within about 3-5 miles. Have video and pics for the second sighting.  On Saturday August 14th at around 5:30pm while floating on my back in the swimming pool looking straight up at the sky, my wife and I observed two bright “star-like” objects directly above us. I have always been interested and have observed/studied different aircraft and can usually make out what kind of aircraft in is in the sky.  One of the objects stayed stationary in the sky while the other was moving at a relatively slower speed (and very smoothly through the air) than a typical jet type passenger aircraft and heading south. The moving object seemed to disappear or I just lost visual sight of it after about 5 minutes. The object would speed up and slow down during the 5 minutes of observation.  After losing sight of the first moving object, I looked back at the other object and it was still motionless in the sky. It appeared to be a star (Which was strange considering stars are not usually visual during this time of day with the sun still shinning bright) because it was so still in the sky. After what seemed to be 2 minutes, this second object began to move south in the sky as well about the same speed as the first. This object would also speed up then slow down and make slight turns while ultimately keeping a flight path towards the south.

It was pitch black dark and I was the only person in my car. I was driving calmly when I see a reddish light on the right corner of my front mirror. At first I think it’s another car that is beside me but I look and there’s nothing so then I lean forward and see three red lights in a triangular shape above the trees about a quarter mile into the forest. At first I think it’s the street lights, but lights don’t go that deep into the forest and they are not red. So I proceed to stare at it. I did not stop to further investigate because I wanted to get home as quickly as possible and I was a little scared cause in the back of my mind I was thinking that maybe it’s a UFO.  So I just look at it for maybe 30 sec when I pass it.  Then maybe one minute or two, I see reddish shining light behind me about half a mile away.  This light had a tiny blinking yellowish light in the middle of it.  At first I thought it was a car, but I remembered that car lights are yellow so then I started to get scared because this light was following me at the same distance for about two minutes.  From my rear view mirror I can see that this light is just above the road, but the light was big and wide enough not to be a car. After about two minutes pass, I pass the Snoqualmie Pass and come close to street lights and a semi on the northbound side. I look at my rear view mirror and the light is gone.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,,

What caught our eye was that there were no running lights on this vehicle (I am not a pilot, but I think it is a big no-no to fly through the city without any lights on, but I may be wrong).  As it approached from the west, traveling about the speed of a helicopter or small plane, we kept waiting to hear some kind of engine noise to help us know what we were seeing (Police helicopter, Traffic reporter, etc).  We never heard any sound. Since we never heard any sound, we thought that maybe our depth perception was off and it was actually flying higher than the 1000-2000 foot altitude than we thought.

It was tiny. This “dot” of cloud began expanding rapidly. It caught my attention and, while still staring at it, I called my mother. I pointed to the cloud and asked her to look at it, that the cloud was forming a fast pace. She did and, was as amazed as I was. A cloud formed out of nowhere!

At that moment another object flew out of the same cloud that had just formed. My mother then ran inside grabbed her binoculars and watched as a third object flew out. The first object was heading towards us, the second headed East and the third, headed west. The objects disappeared in front of our eyes. They just banished.

While visiting friends,the unidentified aerial phenomenon was seen by me and four others in West Richland, Washington on August 27, 2010 at approximately 2115 hours.  The weather was very clear with a few scattered high altitude clouds in the west.   If facing west the object was first spotted at about the 11 o’clock position.  It was traveling in a straight line east to west and disappeared over the horizon in less than a minute. At first we thought it was a satellite, due to its speed and trajectory.   We quickly realized that it was much too large and bright to be a satellite and then thought it might be the space station.  Again this was discounted due to the size of the object.  It had to be very large and very high or it had to be at a much lower altitude and traveling faster than any airplane any of us had ever seen. The object was a large white light or maybe several white lights close together forming what appeared to be a single light.  It was extremely bright and the shape of the object behind the lights was indiscernible.  There was absolutely no engine noise.  The object moved in a straight trajectory directly toward the sun, which had already set.  As stated the object was over the horizon in less than a minute.  I will not speculate as to its speed. The witnesses to this event are extremely credible.  None of us had any guess as to what this object may have been. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS at 21:20 hrs., but west to east.

From where we are located, we have an unobstructed view of the western sky. On the night of Saturday August 28, 2010, the skies were clear with temps in the low 70's. At about 9:25 that evening, I went outside to get something out of my truck. We had been cooking and canning vegetables from our garden all day, and the house was quite warm inside. Noticing how pleasantly cool it was outside, I asked my girlfriend if she might like to come outside for a while to cool off. As we stood down by the water, chatting and looking at the house lights from across the lake, something caught my eye in the west northwestern night sky. At an elevation of about fifty degrees, a bright white star-like object had suddenly appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. Had this object been stationary, and not as bright, I might have mistaken it for just a large star. But it was not stationary. It was moving in a northerly direction at what appeared to be a very high rate of speed. After about three or four seconds from the time it first appeared, it executed a very tight, almost flat, 180 degree turn to the south, and after proceeding in this new direction for another three or four seconds, it just as suddenly seemed to ""turn off"" again, just like someone turning off a light switch, and became invisible to our eyes once more in the night sky. Please understand that when I used the word ""turn"", I am not speaking of any kind of a turn in the conventional way.  This object, whatever it was, had managed to accomplish a complete and opposite change of direction in less than a second.  It's speed remained constant throughout the entire manuver, and it's motion can only be described as ""fluid"". As we stood there in silence for perhaps fifteen seconds or so, trying to comprehend what this actually was that we had just witnessed, another bright white ""star""  ""turned on"" in the west southwestern sky. I took this to be the same object that we had seen before, as the size and light intensity were the same, as was it's elevation above the horizon. This time however, the same manuver that we had just witnessed was being repeated in reverse, with the object making another of those ""impossible"" 180 degree turns, and heading back to the north again before ""turning off"" once more. We stood there for several more minutes watching the sky, but it did not reappear again.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,42.4076,-73.6564

I stopped (at a green light) to see what it was but cannot wrap my head around what I saw. It was grayish blue, there were no streetlights just car headlights, it is very dark around the hospital, and I estimate it as being the size of a large dog. To me it looked like some sort of creature, floating silently and slowly straight up. No drifting or blowing in the wind. It had what looked like a very large head with the rest of the body which did appear to have 4 appendiges about the same size as the head, and it appeared to be almost upside down. it didnt move, just floated up as if being lifted from the sky. I turned around and went back, and it was gone. I parked in the back of the hospital parking lot and a man with a little boy were walking out to the road pointing and looking where the object had been. I walked up to him and asked if they saw it too and if they knew what it was. He said that he did, he was able to see it from up close to the hospital. But he didn’t know what it was either. It was gone. I don’t know hoe it could have disappeared so fast or whether anyone else in the cars saw it. Looking out the windows that night I noticed the moon was large, and there was a very large very bright light that stayed in the same proximity to the moon the entire night.

As it cruses eastward for a bit it all of a sudden dose the unthinkable! It abruptly moves in a straight horizontal line in a flash northward, and I am now dead on, squared, straight forward, looking at the back end of this sucker. It is massive, and is now Four houses ahead in the sky over the backyards of where I am in the pool. As I look over the fence that is parallel with the hight of the pool the object is heading Eastward. It seams to ! be powered by 6 white lights in groups of 2, in 3 neatly stacked rows inside a vertical rectangle. The object makes no noise the entire time over the course of the viewing. While the craft is heading eastward it now decides to yaw left towards the NorthEast in a diagonal line pattern. As the craft travels NorthEast the back end lights are now separating off the back end of the craft and are rapidly creating a pulsing light dance around the craft, like electrons dancing around an atom. The balls of white lights are now pulsating rapidly to the point where they are looking like they are giving off static electric shocks and light bolts. While doing this the craft so elegantly yet very swiftly fades away into oblivion. The duration of time felt like an eternity to me, but sadly I later estimated the event to ruffly 40 seconds; a minute was way to long. This is my testimony to what I had encountered. It is up to you my Friends to make of it what you want.

We were driving E.(East) on Highway 7 near Waterloo at the time. According to Google Maps the exact towns name is Wilmot, Ontario.  The highway did not have any lights on the side of the road, making it very easy to see the stars in the sky.  At 21:50 (9:50pm) I was looking out the window from the back seat of the car (right side) and was looking at the stars, which I enjoy watching occasionally at home. When I was looking up, I noticed two objects straight up very far off in the distance moving across the sky very quickly from right to left. The objects were moving very fast side by side from the right side to the left side. At first, the objects were traveling beside each other, but after a couple of seconds the object farthest away from me quickly turned and started separating from the other object. After a few more seconds, the objects once again started traveling parallel to each other.  I told my younger brother who was also with me that I see something strange in the sky, he looked up and also saw the two objects. He also said they did not look like planes or satellites.  I tried taking a picture, but the objects were too dim to be displayed on the camera. We pulled the car to the side of the road to take a better picture, but when we did, we lost track of the objects, they split up again and vanished.

I live in an area where planes fly over head of my house all the time. My house is located where the planes turn around and head for their final approach for landing.

Planes travel relatively slowly when you see them really high in the air, but these two objects were moving super fast! I have never seen anything move that fast, that far away. I also want to state that I know how satellites look like. I do see some occasionally in the night as I do look at the stars frequently. They do go fairly slow and are a bit dim. But, this was much faster and both objects were much brighter and were constantly lit, not going from dim to bright and so forth. These objects were for sure not planes or satellites.  *I know when this happened and where this happened exactly because I had a GPS at the time and I recorded an audio clip of myself explaining what I saw; location, time, etc.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,43.48127139479905,-80.53647872340426

It somewhat resembled a star at first, but then it became clear that it was giving off both blue and red light, and also had a shaft of light on the front of it, which distorted its twinkling, and made it look more unusual.  I watched the object for several minutes, wondering what it was. It stayed stationary the whole time, and eventually I went to bed.   This object was very bright and memorable. I witnessed a similar object the next night, elsewhere in the sky. Once again I observed it for several minutes and it stayed stationary.  These objects are no longer in the sky.  The moon offered a great reference point for the first one I saw, since it was so close to the left of the moon, and it is obvious that whatever it was is now gone.

There was also another cloud just to the east/ south east that was fatter and shorter and was directly over me at one point.

He knocked on the window to get the attention of my 14 year old son who looked out the window and then ran out.  Once it was over the street I ran inside for my camera. I realized my SD card was not inside of it as we just returned from Mexico. By the time i got back outside, the fire ball was gone. My husband had come in and grabbed his camera off of the counter and was able to get a few seconds of this, but it was not clear and the ball of fire looked too small and white in the video. I asked where it went and my son said it went in a straight line, never stopping, and then it curved to the left and sped up and then disappeared. We went inside and about 15 minutes later I heard a helicopter. We went outside and saw it flying slowly over our house and then in the direction that the light had come from. It proceeded to then fly over a few more times. It never went in the direction that the object flew towards. We live less than 10 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, this is the direction in which the fire ball flew. We do not get alot of helicopter activity over our home.

None of our neighbors were outside. There was no sound whatsoever as this thing flew over us. No smell at all. It did not hover or stop or go in any other direction while it was over us. It went in a straight line and at the same altitude until it got pretty far then curved, sped up and disappeared.

Veneta is very small town so there is not much in the way of lights to block out the sky so I was checking it out as I walked.

The color seemed strange but I assumed whatever it was would become more easily identifiable, once it got closer, in the form of clearly blinking lights or lights other than the flickering orange.  This however was not the case.  Its appearance did not change in any way.  I could not make out any definite shape or see anything other than just an orange slightly flickering light.  Judging by my perception of its altitude it was not a very large object.

I could hear no sound coming from its direction.  When it had reached my position it slowed to a stop.  It was now just east of me as I stood in the library parking lot along Territorial Hway.

Though I saw the UFO by Mather AFB (formerly an air force base) over extended right base heading west (by Capital Christian church) it cross over  the flight pattern heading east.  The shape of the object seem more like a comet's tail except it did not flare out like a comet, but more like long lengthy wavering shimmer of white.  Not like a comet where the pattern trail is consistent. This object had waves as it traveled from south to north east.  The closest shape would be a smooth long rectangular see through cloud that was traveling fast and keeping its shape too, Not a lenticular cloud.  As private pilot and air crew in the air force, I have neve! r seen this type of cloud move so fast with a white shimmer contrasting with the black background, the night sky. In fact I have never seen this at all.  It reminds me of a spirit like in the movies, but much longer than a C-5 Air craft. I had time to take good look, around for clouds, other air craft's that are usually noisy, but this one did not have a noise or any sound.  It did not leave a trail, but it did move relatively fast, faster than plane coming into Mather's flying pattern.  In fact I was able to run to the second floor and look out the east window of the house and continued to observe it.  I mention it to my wife who was also upstairs and we both quickly looked out the east window and saw it together.  Although my wife is near sighted, she still was able to see a faint cloud like shape moving horizontal.  The object disappeared with our neighborhood lights. I can tell you what it's not: •	an airplane or a jet at near idle speed coming for a landing •	No navigational or landing lights •	Not a helicopter •	Not the Space Station in which we sometimes see it fly by •	Smoke cloud. Smoke clouds do not move in that form •	Not a lenticular cloud (see plenty of those at high altitude) I went back out and really looked at the sky and I thought I saw another faint object and it disappeared.

It was just a normal evening and our dog started acting strange and my children were outside. I yelled out to my children to come take the dog out thinking that maybe he had to go out, but he was acting out of control, jumping on a table near the window like he wanted to jump right through the window.  After a few moments I became frustrated and put the dog on his leash to do it myself since my children were not listening to me. I stepped out the door with the dog, frustrated that my children were not even responding to me and enquiring as to why they ignored me. I saw my children all standing in the yard staring up into the sky as if they were mesmerized by something. I started looking up to see what had their attention and there was a craft of some kind, hovering over the trees.  The craft we saw was like a saucer shaped craft with a ! large dome on top of it, There were many lights shining from the lower portion of the craft ranging in color from the brightest white I have ever seen, to a peach color.  The craft was a dark grey metallic color and underneath of the craft had 16 dark spots that appeared to be like holes or tube shaped portals that led into the craft. We all stood there mesmerized for what felt like forever, including the dog, unable to move or speak, though in reality the whole thing took no more than two minutes.  As we stood there looking at this craft, it suddenly shot straight into the sky so fast we could not stay focused on it.  Within seconds of the craft leaving there were 3 fighter jets in formation flying by, one of which appeared to try following the craft into the sky, while the other two appeared to stay near the tree line.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,38.3992,-90.5566

I have never seen anything like what I saw and quite frankly, have never believed in aliens or UFO's.  Now I'm not so sure. I was on my way home from a class I attended in Salt Lake City. It was around 9:20 in the evening. (Approx.) I turned off 6200 S. and onto 4800 W going south and as I passed the gas station I noticed a reddish-orange light hovering above our park. (This park is a ""depressed"" park. That's where all the water goes after it rains. At this time there was a little bit of water, but not much.) I thought it was a helicopter as we do have a small airport by our nieghborhood, but I thought it was strange for it to be just hovering there. I drove a little further towards it and decided to stop and see what it really was. I pulled over, turned off my music, and rolled down my window. There was no noise coming from it and I could see that it was only maybe 20 yards above the park. A VW beetle with two teenage girls pulled into the center lane and watched the light for a few seconds, then they drove off. I was about to drive off when it started to move upwards, going east/slightly north. I was intending to watch it go back towards the airport, but then it picked up speed and a reddish/orange light (like the one I originally saw) illuminated the object and I could see it was round, not a helicopter or any planes they fly at the airport. It lit up for maybe a second or two, then took off towards the stars. I watc! hed it till it disappeared, which only took a matter of seconds. I sat in my car for a couple more minutes, trying to figure out what I just saw. I drove home and I was very scared afterwards. I was very intrigued when I was watching it because at that point (before it was lit up) I thought for sure it was a helicopter. After it lit up and took off, I knew it wasn't a helicopter. When I finally got the courage to get out of my car and carry my stuff in the house, I walked in, locked the doors and windows, then proceeded to tell my parents what happened. They were interested and told me it sounded like a UFO. I didn't want to believe that what it was, but the more I think about it, the more I want to know what it was. I didn't sleep well that night at all.  If anyone can tell me what it could have been, please let me know. Before this I refused to believe in UFO's, but now I'm not so sure.

The craft was silent - moving rapidly West/Northwest for about 15 or 20 seconds, approximately. Then, without slowing down at all, it stopped for a fraction of a second, dipped a huge dip downward, and started moving in a Northerly direction.  After the craft flew by a few more stars in our Earth sky, (5 seconds) it was gone. It was very far away but seemed to be in our solar system, for it flew in front of Saturn and then almost halfway across the sky in just 20 seconds or so.

Within 10-15 minutes after the second sighting, (the one of which I had observed), my boyfriend reported to me that he saw another craft.  He still could not make out the shape of the craft, but it was very similar to the previously described. This craft was MUCH  closer to Earth than the first two crafts, massive in size, and was absolutely in our solar system. (Again, we were using Saturn as a relative coordinate). It  also had many blinking blue and red lights, AND  had white blinking lights,– all of which were flashing sporadically - , was visible for 35-45 seconds, approximately, and was moving South/Southwest and then West, silently.

The craft was silent and was moving West / Northwest for about 15 or 20 seconds...zooming!!  Then it stopped for a fraction of a second, dipped a massive dip downward, and started moving North.  After zooming by a few more stars in my sky, it was gone. It was very far away but seemed almost definitely to be in our solar system, ! for it moved past Saturn and then almost halfway across the sky in just 20 seconds or so.  That is what I saw tonight. My boyfriend had seem one very similar to that just a few minutes before this described sighting going in a different direction, North I think. Within 10-15 minutes after the second sighting, (the one of which I had observed) maybe less, my boyfriend reported to me that he saw another craft (I don't know the shape) very similar to the previously described. However, he described this third craft to be much closer to Earth than the other two but it was still in space. This one, like the other two, not only had blinking blue and red lights all over the craft, it also had white blinking light(blinking without order or rhythm) all over it as well. I am not sure how long it was visible - maybe a minute at most... He noted that it was moving South/Southwest and then West, also without sound. (Note, it is very quiet here in this part of the country. No major airports for hours in all directions.)",2010-11-21T00:00:00,44.5422,-100.2754

I kept observing it because i had never seen a bird so high until it went below an even higher object and the bird flew away and i was fixated on this other object. The other object looked like no bird, but my first thought was it had to be one or a balloon.  I could see the sun reflecting off of it and the color was silver, the object was cigar saucer shaped.  The object appeared to be very small only about quarter inch so i knew it was very high up and was not a blimp or anything.  it was very shiny silver because the sun was reflecting off of it.  i have planes that go in the same direction where i was observing the object and i can tell you.  this was flying higher than any plane that passes by.  i saw no planes pass till after the sighting and they were 3 times lower than what this object appeared to be. At first it was very hard to see and i was shocked to see it so i looked away then tried to see if i could find the object and if it was still in the same place. it was.  I stared at the object for about 30 second before it started to move really really really fast, up down, left to right. like nothing i had ever seen before. faster than a plane, bird or anything. it was then i looked away again thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me.  so i looked away and tried to see if it was in the same vicinity.  it was. so i kept my eyes on it while it moved crazy fast.  I observed this for about 1 and a half to 2 minutes before i was in so much shock i couldn't believe it i had to look away again.   After i did that i tried to find it again but it was gone, it disappeared like it was never there but it was.

While observing the airplane,  I noticed what seemed to be an extra part hanging off of one of the wings and wondered if the plane was coming apart. Then the piece, which was not much larger than a dot, moved so that it appeared as if it were flying between the airplane's south (near) wing and its tail. That's when I realized it was a separate, flying object. As I watched the dot seemed to vanish for a moment and then I noticed it now flying just in front of the aircraft. They both then passed over the Cleveland Avenue hill extremely close together. I checked my watch, which read 7:56 PM.  It seemed way to small to be a regular aircraft. The airplane's apparent length was slightly less than the diameter of a dime held at arm's length. The object flying around it  appeared smaller than any of the engines.

I have photos to email. This is a three day report  1 Sep - 3 Sep  Maricopa, Az. Day 1   1 Sep  Skies clear, no moon  Time 10:00-10:30PM  Being that I was sitting around the house doing nothing and due to my first ever UFO sighting back in May, I decided to go out and try my luck at spotting the UFO again. So I got my camera and went for a drive on route 347 which was around 9:30 PM.  I first went south for a 4 or 5 mile, saw nothing. So I made a u-turn and headed towards Phoenix for about 5 mile outside of Maricopa, saw nothing. Made a u-turn and headed back to Maricopa. When I was about a mile outside of Maricopa city limits and looking up as I was driving, just off to the left of 347 one of the orange orbs slowly appeared, then went out and came back on again. A split second later a second orb appeared some distance to the left of the first and when back out. Then the first orb went out and a third orb appeared just to the right of the first and when back out. Not know their actual position, I drove through town on 347 and turn left on N. Bowlin Rd. (due to the large open area) and parked hoping to get a ph! oto of them if they should reappear. At this location I had a good overall field of view plus I could see the Harrah's Phoenix Ak-Chin casino were I first saw the orbs and I hoped they would reappear near the casino. I stayed there for about an hour but I never saw them reappear so I went home for the night.  Day 2   2 Sep  Skies clear,  no moon  Time 9:45-10:00PM  Around 9:00 PM headed out of the house with camera hoping to see and maybe get a picture of the orbs. Drove back to the Bowlin Rd. location and waited. About 45 min. goes by, lots of air traffic out of Phoenix and over Maricopa, but no orbs. So I’m looking toward Phoenix and turn around to look towards the casino to see an orb that looked to be hovering less than a 1000 ft. just over the Harrah's Phoenix Ak-Chin casino and then when out. So I’m happy that I saw the orb but not enough time to get a picture. I waited hoping it would em to reappear. About 15 min. later an orb slowly appeared and then went back out to the left of 347 across from the casino but a little farther out. Then a second orb appeared a little to the right of the first and went out. Then the third appeared a little right of the second and went out. I had gotten sidetrack trying to light a cigar it and couldn’t get my camera turn on in time to take a photo. So I waited hoping for one more chance to take a ! picture. About 15 min later the first orb slowly reappears to the right of the casino and goes out. The second orb appears (photo 2 ND) and went out. The third orb appears (photo 3 RD) and goes out. So now I’m real happy, I’ve got photos of a UFO to backup my 24 May MUFON report. Being that the UFOs were near the casino I drove down 347 and turned left on N. Farrell Rd. and parked, hoping to get better pictures. I waited about 20 min but no sightings. As I was standing there I happen to look down the road and into the fields on the Ak-Chin reservation and off to the left of Farrell Rd. I could see two white shimmering lights that slowly faded out and slowly came back on a few second later. Now I’m thinking the UFO is on the ground, so I drive onto the reservation for a better look and pictures. I found a spot where I could see about five or six of the lights on the ground in the field just behind the house were Farrell and Thomas St/Rd intersect. They were all shimmering, f! our or five of them would slowly fade in and out of view but n! ever cha nge their location. I also saw a couple of really small light that were moving in the location of the larger lights.  I took a few pictures but most were bad. So I’m posting the two best that show two light (first picture), then you can see a third starting to come on again. You can also make out some of the other lights. The green blue lights are not part of the craft. After about 15 or 20 min. of looking at the UFO I started out for home. I drove pass a really good spot to get better pictures so I made a u-turn to go back that’s when I spot the Ak-Chin police (someone had called me in) coming from all points. So I pull over and told them what was doing, told them about the UFO sighting, showed they one of the photo and I even pointed out one of the lights of the UFO that faded out and in while we were talking. I was told that either side of the main road was Indian property and that I would be trespassing if I left the main road. Then I was told to have a nice day they got! back into their cars and drove way. I went home to start typing this. It was about 10:50 PM.  Day 3   3 Sep  Skies clear,  no moon  Time 5:45-6:00 AM  4:30AM wake up for a nap sitting in front of the computer. Decide to go to Wal-Mart to pickup a few things. Departed the house 5:05AM thought I drive over to the reservation to if the lights were still there from the UFO or maybe it could have been a construction site or something. Get to the location no lights, no construction equipment, no construction, no nothing, just green farm land. Head out to Wal-Mart. Driving on route 238 towards Casa Grande coming up on traffic light of intersection 238 and Shea Way about to make left turn in to Wal-Mart. Light is green.  All of a sudden, out of nowhere, in a knife edge position, in maybe a 30 degree angle traveling at an extreme high rate of speed, in a northeast direction, is a large dark gray or black V shape craft with five white lights, one in the middle and two lights on each wing. It appear too me that it had just taken off from one of the fields to the right of 238. As the craft rolled over to a horizontal position I saw th! e lights flash then the craft made a hard right turn and disappeared over the horizon. I was in a low part of the road so disappearing over the horizon was an easy task. So I sat through a cycle or two of the traffic light, spellbound. I sapped out of it due to a truck leaving Wal-Mart and went right pass the WTF moment to the Nobody is going to believe this. I wouldn’t believe this myself, that all of this could happen to one guy in less the 8 hours. So I drove down 238 a little farther just incase there was more to see. Now I’m on the high side of the road, I can see all over the area. Again out of nowhere, in a knife edge position, in maybe a 30 degree angle traveling at an extreme high rate of speed, in a northeast direction, is the craft, which appears to have just taken off. The lights flash again as it rolls horizontal. It makes a hard right turn and heads out to the mountains to the south. It makes a hard left turn (flyby photo) and now heading north back in my dire! ction. Once it’s over or just pass the Ak-Chin Farm complex ar! ea, it m akes a hard right turn and heads south back to the mountains. It then makes a hard right turn and heads north in my direction and lands (landing photo) in the fields off to the left of the farm complex. It’s getting pretty light out so I’m thinking it may clear the area soon. I wait at my location between N. White and Parker Rd and N. Porter Rd. for about an hour waiting for it to take off again but it never did or maybe I missed the take off during the passing of one of three frigate trains. I ended the wait and made a right on White and Parker and another right on W. Peters and Nall Rd. just to see if I could spot the craft which I didn’t. Made the loop back Wal-Mart.  As for the craft I saw. It was dark gray or black non reflective, taper wing design much like the B-2 bomber. Five white lights evenly spaced, one in the middle and two on each wing which looked to flash when it made its first maneuver. Extremely fast with no sound and highly maneuverable. Other than the possible knife edge take offs it flew pretty much like any other pitch/roll aircraft just tighter. Steep banks with almost wingtip type turns. If you’ve ever seen a glider do a tight wingtip turn that’s what this craft can do only at very high speeds. As for landing I can only assume that it went from fast to dead stop hover and land. It didn’t look to really slow down to land. It just made the fast descent and land. I couldn’t make out a cockpit or cabin area because it was moving to fast. Also I can’t remember if I saw the five lights on the underside of the wing because it was moving to fast. I did notice it had what could be blinking nav. lights on the wing tips. It was ! large but not really overly large but it did have the longest wing span of any aircraft I’ve even seen. When you look at it head on it pretty thin and almost disappears with the mountain backdrop. I would have to give it a 9 for being a good looking craft as compared to our normal military aircraft that are flying today. Sure was something to see. May buy me a camcorder tonight and get back out there by 5AM just incase.  That’s it, you guys can stop reading now. Sorry for being so long, for any mistakes you may find and for not getting better pictures. Something is better than nothing. I did make a report to include photos to the Pinal/Maricopa police.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,33.055867567567574,-112.05598918918919

On our drive home at about 8:55 p.m, we passed a cleared lookout spot on top of one of the park’s hills and saw several very bright, yellow-orange lights, stationary in the sky, northeast of our location.  We parked and got out of the car immediately, and then stood in the dark watching these lights for the next four minutes approximately. The park has many of these scenic overlooks where trees have been removed and people can pull their cars off the roads and view forested hills, perhaps as far away as 15-25 miles.  Brown County is very rural and covered with forested hills.  There is no town, or towers, or any high structures in the direction of these lights.  However, Camp Atterbury, a military camp, is about 10 miles east of this location. For the next four minutes or so, we watched these lights come on, stay lit about 30 seconds or so, and then go off, fading quickly. We noticed as one light would go out, another would often come on in another location. Often, the lights seemed to be grouped in a diamond-shape pattern, but this shape changed as a light would go off. We saw as many as 5 lights at one time, and as few as one, before all of them went completely out. They appeared, at first, to be stationary, but through careful observation we noticed that lights would go slightly out of alignment with each other, suggesting very slow movement. We wondered if these lights were attached to a larger shape or form that we could not make it out. They were bright and it was getting dark. It is also hard to say how far away they were from us with any accuracy. They may have been a mile or so away. Even if they were as close as a mile away, the lights themselves would be rather large and exceedingly bright. If they were! attached to a form, it would be gigantic. They may have been have been several hundred feet in the air and were above tree line. Becasue we do not know how far away they were, it is also hard to determine how high they may have been. My wife had her iPhone and located the direction of the lights (northeast from where we stood) and zoomed in to take a picture at a time when three lights were present. My son (age 24) and I watched similar very bright, yellow-orange lights one night, in the same direction, about 2 ½ months ago. They also went off and on as well; there were about 10 lights or so. At that time, we heard what sounded like thunder rumbling coming from these lights. When I asked him what they looked like to him, he replied, ""They look like the lights on the front of a stereo equilizer, moving slightly in relationship to each other.""",2010-11-21T00:00:00,39.1747,-86.2106

I was in my back yard using 10 power binoculars and facing east. I was panning from north to south and back again, when when the sighting began. Looking almost directly east, I saw four objects in formation. Two were parallel to each other in the center of the formation. Two more were to ether side of the central objects; they were slightly behind the two in the center.  As the objects proceeded to the south, the positions of the objects shifted relative to each other, but the formation maintained itself in pretty much the same small area of sky. As the formation reached the farthest point south that I could follow them , the lowest or eastern most object drifted east, or below , the other three objects a very noticeable distance, but then soon after returned to the formation. Soon after this, the sighting ended due to sky conditions making it nearly impossible to follow them further. The best way to describe their appearance is that they looked like very dim "" light sabers "" as seen in the StarWars films !  They were thin and much longer than they were thick ,and they glowed dimly. Through binoculars, they all were the same size and appearance; the length of each was perhaps one - fifth the diameter of a full moon. The edges of the objects were indistinct, due to the glow the objects apparently emitted, yet they seemed to be solid and rigid. Had I not been using binoculars, I doubt that this sighting would have been possible. I believe the objects would have been too small and dim to be seen naked-eye from my light-polluted location.  I am an amateur astronomer and have taken a course in extreme weather watching, provided by the National Weather Service. For me , this sighting falls into the "" Five-Percent  Category "" for being an unexplainable sighting.

Knowing the sky after living out here for a few years, I quickly made the mental note that it wasn’t a star. As I looked at the light it increased in luminosity rapidly. This increase took place very quickly- I would say within 5 seconds and made the light/object appear to increase in size dramatically. Additional lights then blinked on in quick succession- first one to the east, then one to the west, and another even further west. The additional lights came on at a luminosity that matched the first light. They were evenly spaced, making me wonder if they were separate or part of one large object. All the lights rose simultaneously- moving upward and southward at great speed, disappearing from sight. I have seen numerous things in the night sky out here- this is the first that I cannot come up with an explanation for. I am used to seeing flares over the hills to the west of my home, and I am familiar with both military and commercial air traffic that frequents our skies. The size and brightness of the light I saw was well in excess of the luminosity of the stars and planets in the sky. The increase in brightness is highly irregular in the sky.

I was driving home in my vehicle at approximately 7 pm on Sept 4, 2010 and noticed a bright white light in the sky ahead of me.  The light was steady, not blinking or twinkling, and there were no other lights around it.  I was driving East.  I have a Windstar minivan that has a long, slopping windshield and provides a big view of the sky above.  I didn’t pay attention to the light at first, it was sitting nearly stationary and there is an airport close by so there are helicopters in the air all the time.  But, this light was so bright I couldn’t ignore it.  Note, it was not dark yet, I did not have my headlights on yet. The size was approximately the same diameter as holding the round end of a pencil eraser at arms-length. But, immediately I noticed the object the light was attached to. It was round (well, circular looking at to directly) and very dark, almost black.  So it seemed to create a black halo (though obviously solid) around the light (keep in mind the sk! y was still bright and light blue at the time).  Since I was driving east, the sun was behind me at this time. I could only estimate, based on what I know of small aircraft (I’ve lived near an airport my entire life, and I am now 50 years old… I’ve seen thousands of aircraft in the sky), I can say it was flying lower than most Cessnas, but higher than the medivac helicopters I’ve seen. My mind, for what it’s worth, latches on to the idea that it must have been 16-20 feet in diameter, black body included. As I continued driving (35 mph on a dead-straight road, in the middle of town which is completely flat) the object picked up a little speed and started moving away from me in a curved path (if you drive toward a stationary object or star, it would 'seem' to be coming closer, not moving away from you). I would estimate this movement to be about the speed of a medivac helicopter (at this distance, a helicopter can be heard, and it was warm and I had my windows down. There was no noise coming from this craft).  It continued to move, I would estimate about 10-15% across the sky, curving ! east.  Now, here’s where it gets interesting… everything before I just consider curious, but not not-worthy. But, as I stopped at the stop light (so my car’s movement has no bearing now), this craft literally took off! Heading in the direct opposite direction it was heading. It was heading directly West and directly toward me. All this time I had been looking at it at approximately a 45% angle from the ground… this thing went from moving East to moving West immediately, and went from 45% to directly overhead in no more than 2 seconds, and it disappeared from my view out the windshield. I can’t say where it went from there, but directly West (as it was traveling) from where I was, and only about 2 miles away, is one of the largest oil refineries in the East (the Marathon Petroleum Refinery). So, if it kept it’s course, it would have passed directly over the refinery.  I then turned 'right on red' at the light, and looked out the passenger-side door window, but the object was already gone from the sky.  I would like to repeat, it was broad daylight, no cars had their lights on, there were no interior lights in my van to cause reflections. This object, whatever it is, was in the sky, and maneuvered in a way that no known aircraft can.  Again, me, I’m 50 years old, college educated, a professional artist. This is the first report I’ve ever made, this is the first thing in the sky I’ve ever seen that I can’t explain using logic.  I looked on the site earlier and saw a few other reports this month from my area regarding a bright white light, so decided I should report what I saw as well.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,38.38493857677903,-82.41140524344569

I discovered I had the direction of travel of the craft incorrectly stated in the original report.  (It was going EAST, not West.)  I'm also adding the final paragraph which describes an corroboration from another location on the same night, only minutes after my sighting. On Saturday nights, I sing onboard the historic Dixie, Indiana’s, oldest paddle-wheel tour boat on Webster Lake in North Webster, Indiana.  Weather permitting, I perform on the top deck of the boat which is uncovered. We have a clear, unobstructed view up there of the night sky.   On 09-14-10  ((sic.  09-04-10)), the sky was mostly clear with a few light clouds here and there.  The sky was a sea of stars and there was no moon.  The day had been windy, but by our 9PM departure time, it was very calm on the lake. At about 10 PM, we were emerging from a bay in the southeast corner of the 600-acre lake and were traveling west at about 5 miles per hour on the last leg of our tour.  I was just finishing a song when the captain of the boat tapped me on the shoulder and pointed into the night sky directly above the boat, calling my attention to a very strange spectacle. An object was flying very slowly in a due east direction above and to the port (left) side of our paddleboat. It was so strange, I called the attention of the passengers to this object.  There were about 15 people on the upper deck, all of whom had a perfectly clear view of the object simply by looking up, and approximately 30 more on the lower, covered deck.  Most of those on the lower deck went to the port-side windows to stare up at the object. I’m not very good at estimating heights, but this object flew above the spotty clouds at what I thought was no more than a few thousand feet.  The entire object appeared about the size of a dime held at arm’s length. The leading edge of the object was a large, very bright red, glowing circular spot.  Immediately behind that was a rectangular light (about 3 times as long as the spot) which was an even brighter, orange glow which scintillated and looked very much like an open flame.  All I could see were the lights, neither of which pulsated or flickered other than the flame-like action of the orange ""body.""   We could see no wings or visible superstructure.  The craft was shaped like a fat, red-and-orange exclamation point travelling point-first. It left no smoke or vapor trail. Some of the passengers said they thought it was a helicopter, a hang-glider, or an ultralight, so the captain stopped the boat and turned off the paddlewheel completely.  We could hear no sound of any kind from the object even though it was almost directly overhead. We had the object in sight for at least a minute, but no longer than 2 minutes.  It continued due east, never changing its direction or rate of speed until it was out of sight of us (a mile or so east of the lake.)   I finished my show, and had a talk with the captain.  He said when he first saw it from the wheelhouse, he thought it was a missile, though he could not explain the large red, leading-edge light. Neither the captain nor I reported the incident.  I don’t know if any of the passengers did. Four days later, I started to tell this story to some people at a retirement home where I was performing and immediately one of the employees came out of her office and told me that her son saw the same object fly over the airport (and air force training base) in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, about 40 miles due east.  I asked her to describe what he saw and his description was identical to mine.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,41.3267,-85.66

At approximately 18:35 hours on Sunday the 5th of September 2010 myself along with 5 other witnesses spotted an unusual object in the night sky. Our location was at Wells Beach, in wells Maine looking out towards the eastern sky over the ocean. The object appeared in the southern sky and proceeded to move in a north-easterly direction. The size of the object was hard to speculate, the nearest thing I could compare it to would be the size of a helicopter flying at approximately 500 feet above sea level at what appeared to be a half mile out to sea. The shape of the object was unknown, all that could be seen was a bright orange fire-ball.  The object made no noise, as a helicopter or airplane would. Its speed was too fast for a helicopter but too slow for a jet.  A smaller sensna style airplane was out of the question once again because of the lack of noise. The object did not appear to have made any turns or abrupt movement, it simply followed a straight course for about a mile or two.  Then almost like a dream, the object faded into the blackness of the night sky just parallel to our position.  A second object of the same description, just a little bigger and closer to shore, followed about 5 minutes after the first had disappeared.  The second object also vanished at the same point the first one did.  The strangeness of the object was unmistakable due to the presence of other normal aircraft in the night sky such as planes and satellites.  We were able to get most of the second object on HD digital video. The observers consisted of four college students, a mother, and one high school student who were all outside enjoying the cool late summer evening by the sea.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,43.3199,-70.6318

I pointed out that was a good guess, but as it was traveling too fast (about three hundred mph at that altitude) and in a staight, non-wavering line, not to mention at night,  that a balloon was unlikely.

Four of us, (all but my sister Andrea) saw this last night. It was a very warm night and we were sitting on the deck outs...ide of the house. It was a beautifully clear night and the stars were bright. We had only candles lit to keep the bugs to a minimum. My nephew looked upwards at the sky and said, ""Dad, what is that?""  At that moment, we all looked directly overhead to the sky. Traveling from the south heading almost directly to the north very possibly heading 360 degrees and 90 degrees off of the eastern horizon, all four of us clearly saw two objects. These two objects were traveling in synchronized formation. The lead object led the second object forward and to the left at a distance of about 500 to 1000 miles, depending on the exact altitude. The two objects maintained identical course and speed. Both objects appeared to be similar in appearance to the surrounding stars excepts that they were at least 2 times brighter than Jupiter which was in the eastern skies and the brightest star in the skies. It is difficult to judge the exact altitude of the two objects but they were at least 100,000 feet above sea level and probably higher. Compared to other aircraft in the skies, they were at least three or four times higher. They were traveling at about 4,000 mph or greater. The two objects flew completely synchronous. When they approached almost directly overhead, they slowed to approximately 1,000 mph together. They then initiated a change of direction, heading perpendicular to the Earth directly upwards out towards open space. They then proceeded outwards at a remarkable rate of speed exceeding in our estimation 5,000 to 10,000 mph. As the objects exited our view, their star like appearance gradually reduced down in a dimming fashion to a bright pin point and then became invisable. I have had the good fortune to be present at a space shuttle landing at Cape Kennedy Florida. The re-entry of the orbiter into the Earth's atmosphere is the only thing that I have ever seen that might be comparable to what we saw last night with regard to speeds, altitude and controlled direction of flight. Four individuals who were together on our deck saw this event last night.  We all are in agreement about the details as discribed. I have been on this planet for almost sixty years and I have never seen anything even remotely simmilar to this. We are not making any claims as to exactly what it was that we saw or their origins.  We do believe it to be reasonable to conclude that since the two objects were flying synchronous, changing both speed as well as direction, simultaneously, that they had to be communicating with each other.  We also believe it to be reasonable to conclude that the objects were being intelligently controlled.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,39.16412530864198,-121.02348333333333

We were parked on the south side of Ocean Parkway, half a mile west of the entrance to Cedar Beach. No lights on the highway made for outstanding sky visibility, so we were stargazing for a while.  I saw a regular shooting star that lasted half a second, with a standard quick tail streak, directly north, at a good 80 to 90 degrees above the horizon. Then, about five minutes later, at 60-degrees upward from the horizon, and directly northeast, a pulsating light approximately the width of 1/10th the moon, very bright / white - began traveling in a southeast direction in the sky, maintaining altitude.  The light was definitely not relative to standard aircraft lights including helicopters.  It was pulsating every two or three seconds, switching on, then dimming itself off.  This effect lasted approximately two minutes. At about five minutes later, we both saw what we first suspected was going to be a shooting star  - except, it had no tail streak at all, and it lasted for far too long, and seemed to slow down gradually as it finished.  It lasted about three or four seconds.  The object zipping across the sky was saucer shaped, in a way.  There was a red/beige tint to the object, and it appeared to have an outer circle, and a more solid inner circle.  Object was at most – a fifth the diameter of the moon (outer circle), but gradually dimmed into nothingness.  It’s also suspicious because the beginning of the path of this object happened to intersect with the trajectory of the original pulsating UFO’s path. Five minutes after this effect, that same pulsating light began moving in a western direction, from exactly the same spot that saucer-like shooting star dropped in the sky. This lasted a few more minutes until it dimmed out beyond our visibility.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,40.6278,-73.365

I have been trying to find out how to inquire what would have been in that airspace at that time of night that matched the description of what I saw, which is two bright lights suspended in midair over Willard Bay, just west of I-15, past the Flying J gas station.  The lights were suspended only a few hundred feet off the ground.  The suspended lights did not match the physics of any known aircraft that I am aware of.  In other words, they were not moving in any one direction and they did not make any sound. I passed my cell phone to my wife and asked her to take video, using my Blackberry's video camera, of what we were seeing.  We were only able to obtain about 30 seconds worth of video footage.   As we passed them, I did see some structure to the lights, but I could not see much, as I was driving at about 70 miles per hour on the freeway.

I recorded video's and took some pictures with my phone.,2010-11-21T00:00:00,41.0207,-91.5839

The craft was very atypical of what one may expect from a UFO; I was like watching rhombuses and trapezoids shifting positions, like each shape was its own pane.  Each pane was outlined in a bright white light (about 5 stars thick [in perspective from the Earth]) and the center was  empty.   The craft was also very large (about 5 suns in perspective from the ground), and was within hundreds of feet from the ground.  I pulled the car over in shock, and the gliding tesseral object stopped. I panicked, and I drove off as fast as possible.  Later, I researched the object I spotted and did not find anything that even looked similar to the one I saw.  The one piece of research that was interesting was on light travel.  The online article states that stars could be used to transport in theory; this craft may of well done that.

Nothing out of the ordinary.  I proceeded to scan the night sky.  Just then I noticed two small twinkling lights of the same size in the horizon dancing and flickering.  They were lower than any star or aircraft that would be in the sky.  Possibly only several thousand feet in the sky.  The one light was more toward the north.  The second light was lower than number one and emitting more of a “sparkle” the objects appeared to be circular in shape.  I watched for approximately 2-3 minutes while the lights danced around each other.  From what I saw I am almost positive these were not satellites or any type of terrestrial aircraft.  The bottom light appeared to be glowing or sparkling a red/orange color.  In one quick instance the bottom light stopped dancing and at an incredible speed too! k off into the sky and disappeared within 1-2 seconds.  By the time I had noticed this, the light that was above the one that vanished had dimmed to nothing.  Almost disappearing like the other.

We were looking at the Manhattan skyline right across the river (approx. 38th street) just North of Empire State Building.  The night sky was completely empty of clouds, but I noticed what originally looked like a cloud moving North to South across the NYC skyline. It looked to be only a few hundred feet over the tops of the highest buildings.  It was moving with more speed than I have seen a cloud move but slower than the speed I usually see helicopters move at over the city.  There was very little if any wind. Although it had a greyish/white cloud-like look, it was formed in a somewhat distinct shape...close to what the hokey UFO saucers are depicted as.  I watched as it crossed behind the highest building in my direct line of sight and it seemed to either dissolve or head away from me (toward the EAST) rather than continue along! the same North to South route it had been on.  The entire sighting lasted about 2-3 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Strange glowing light and noise from two crafts in Washington state,Spanaway,WA,2010-09-09T02:00:00,egg,aprox 30-45 secons,"Occurred : 9/9/2010 02:00  (Entered as : 09/09/2010 2:00) Reported: 10/12/2010 8:02:35 PM 20:02 Posted: 11/21/2010 Location: Spanaway (south of), WA Shape: Egg Duration:aprox 30-45 secons",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78323.html,"Strange glowing light and noise from two crafts in Washington state Early in the morning of the Ninth of September, I was with my friend driving on Pacific Highway somewhere between Spanaway and Mt. Rainer. I had to work late that night and my friend had come to pick me up and we decided to go on a late night cruise. We had done the same thing on a number of nights before. I think that it is necessary that before I continue any farther that I explain one thing. This area is populated by two military bases. Ft. Lewis and McChord Air force base, or what is now know as Joint Base Lewis McChord. Obviously military flight and aircraft is very common in the area. I don’t know how many reports this organization receives a year from this area, but I imagine that it is a lot. I also want to make it clear that for reasons I am not going to specify, I can’t say why I, along with my man friend, was out driving through the country on this late summer night. I myself am a member of the uniformed service. We were parked on a side road with very few houses around. We had frequented the area a number of times before. Nothing out of the unusual had ever been acknowledged. While we did experience low flying aircraft, I was always able to identify the type of craft. I think that is why we didn’t notice what happened next until it was almost right in our face. The noise might have been apparent for a minute or two before we noticed it, but I don’t think so. It was not the usual sound of airplane engines or turbulence from low flying helicopters. It was unlike anything I have ever heard as far as aircraft is concerned. It wasn’t exactly so peculiar that it would send up a flag of suspicion right away. Maybe, in the background of the low playing radio and conversation it wouldn’t have been noticed. My mind certainly wasn’t preoccupied with extraterrestrial objects at that particular moment. The sound was definitely the first thing that stopped us in our tracks. It was like a low, vibrating humming sound that you could almost feel, just as much as hear. We both noticed it at the same instant, and as we looked at each other with curiosity and alarm, the first craft came into vision. I don’t want to say that it was a light because, it wasn’t exactly a light. It was more of a glow. A deep fluorescent, greenish glow. I say greenish because; it was almost like a color that I had never really seen before. The light didn’t appear to come from a front, side or back engine source. It radiated from the entire circular craft. In an even distribution, it just glowed. It couldn’t have been more than 1000-1200 feet above us. It was moving at a constant slow speed, probably less than 100 miles an hour. I remember that the light didn’t illuminate the area around us. That was part of what was so goddamn strange about it. This might not make sense but, the light was an intense, ! localized glow. It did provide some illumination on the ground but, not as much as I would have expected. As it continued to move in front of our position we then noticed a second craft approximately two hundred meters behind the first. The glow from the crafts didn’t provide enough light to get a detailed view of any other features that the craft may have had. There was no overlapping shine. They simply looked circular, but not quite a circle. What happened next was what caused us to get the hell out of the area as quickly as possible. With no warning, and no sound of an engine of power source gearing up, both crafts quickly intensified illumination and then elevated their speed to a level that I can’t even begin to estimate. As quickly as they came, they disappeared. The next few minutes were mostly a blur. I remember getting back on the main highway and gassing it as fast as I could back into Spanaway. Most of our dialogue was attributed to a few words of astonishment and vulgarity. It was several minutes before we started rationally talking about what had happened. Needless to say that sleep didn’t come that night. As we calmed our nerves and discussed what had happened, my partner came to the realization that we should keep the events to ourselves. I thought that was crazy, especially because I know others must have seen the same thing. I write this report now more than a month since the event occurred. I have started the report several times and decided not to send it. I scanned your report data base and didn’t see anything else in regards to this event. I write it now with the hopes that someone else has reported it and it just has not been posted. If this is the case, then you will know that this is not a hoax. If you choose to contact me for further details, I ask that you respect my motives for trying to keep this somewhat confidential as far as names are concerned. Thanks for taking the time to read my encounter, and if there is anything else you could tell me, it would be greatly appreciated.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,47.104,-122.4346

I was outside stargazing at the Pleadies  and Orion constellations with my Bushnell Binoculars I was facing due south when out of the southwest came a sparkling object I would say at the 10:00 O'clock position I immediately tried to hone in and adjust my binoculars it was beautiful and scarey at the same time.

I was literally shaking after it disappeared. I was witnes! sing a UFO coming out of the Southwest going through the top right corner constellation of Orion. I ran in the house to call NASA I left 2 messages. I googled where to report UFO'S and found your site so I called and left a message and here is the account of what I saw. It is my 3 rd time witnessing a UFO   !st time I was 14 in 1972 in Detroit Michigan my mother and I witnessed a spaceship on the corner of Junction and Toledo it had shaded 2 city blocks and looked exactly like what was the ship on Independence Day Movie I was in shock my mother grabbed me through me up the steps in the house and locked the doors closed the shades and all I could say was mom call the FBI call the Police oh my GOD. She said I was never to tell anyone ever! So I didn't Until I heard George Noory say he saw it Livonia Michigan my jaw just dropped I knew my mother and I were not the only ones. The 2nd time was several years ago I was driving a semi truck long distance in Arizona and I ! was in Tucson  Arizona watching the triangular shapes of sever! al light s in the night sky I stopped at a truck stop and this time I reported it to the police the lights were there and you could even see them when we got to Phoenix. No sound from them at all. But it sure could move a breakneck speeds. Now I want you to know I don't drink or smoke but this morning I bought a pack of cigarettes. I am 52 years old and what I have said  is the honest to God's truth I will take a polygraph Please let me know if anyone else saw this event this morning.

It caught my eye because the string seemed too long to be a helicopter or any other craft that I would expect to see flying over the water.  The altitude was far too low for a large plane.  I went on to the store and returned home by the same route within about 6 minutes.  Venus was bright and low in the sky, and the moon was a huge crescent low on the horizon, and I wanted my son to see them.  I went into my house and called my son to come see.  We got back into my car and circled the block so he could see from the same approach that I had.  Then I really noticed that over the water there were lights, red, blue (or green) and white, the white strobing, in a triangular pattern, flying really low over the water.  I pointed them out to my son, and ! tried to make sense of what they could be.  I rounded the corner to my house and parked, and my son went in as he had no interest in the lights.  I walked down to the waters edge to watch.  I saw the triangle formation break up, the two leading points continued forward and the trailing point turned and reversed direction.  That was the first time I would see that it was not a single craft, but multiple small crafts.  It was dark and I could not see the shape of the crafts at all, I could only see the lights.  I watched for about 5 minutes and could see that there were at least 6 fairly small craft, flying over the water, three very close and three more in the near distance.  They flew back and forth, and in random patterns and did not reform the triangular formation.  There was no wind, and the water was very calm, and I could not hear a sound from engines.  These things were silent, agile and maneuvered in ways I have not seen from aircraft.  I ran back to my house to get my son to come and see what was going on.  He refused, maybe a little scared.  I immediately went back (this distance is about 175 feet, and the waterway is visible from my yard) to the waterfront and at first I thought they were gone.  They had gone high, and were hovering in a partial circle above the water but also over the land area back in the direction of (but beyond) my house.  I was able to spot them because of the strobing lights, and though high I could still see the red and blue lights as well as the strobing white.  A couple out walking their dog came along and I pointed the craft out to them and told them what I had seen.  They also saw them hovering high, and didn’t have an idea what they could be.  I stayed out for another 5 minutes or so, I could see them easily over the water and as the circle went behind me over land I had to walk around to see them because of the many large trees, but there were at least 6 that I could see.  There may have been more, but I could not see all of the sky from where I stood.  My son then came out of the house after me, so I went home.  I think the first string of red lights that I saw may have been the 6 of them flying in line, but turned so only the red light was easily visible.  Norfolk Naval Station is directly across the water from where I was.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,37.054642378048776,-76.37444359756097

The sun had gone down about an hour before and we were experiencing a lot of activity, including electrical failure with a lot of our equipment and extraordinary levels of EMF. We were sitting in our vehicle trying to figure out why the engine had died when a high pitch electrical screeching began.  At first we assumed the noise was emanating from some interference with our equipment, but we ran tests and found that this was not the case.  None of us could pinpoint the source of the sound. Suddenly,  in the pitch black, we saw a huge bright, white light in the sky.  I looked up and my first thought was that it was a planet or a comet.  But whatever it was moving too erratically.  It couldn’t be a plane either, it was zipping across the sky at an amazing speed.  At first it whizzed in a fast Z-shape pattern before moving into a graceful arc right over our heads.  I could see that it was 3-dimensional, maybe a sphere, but the white light was too bright to know for sure.  It flew over our heads and disappeared behind some trees.

My parents witnessed this with me and no explanation.   Well on Sunday night, the object returned, only this time, we were closer to the object.  I noticed it while at the bank, it appeared as 2 bright blue lights, a electric blue in which no other plane I have ever seen has had.   I called my wife who was around the corner getting yogurt, and then also saw the object. I took care of bank business as I watched the object move east and I thought it was going to disappear.  When I met with my wife a moment later, we clearly saw the object almost directly above us, and thought it was a helicopter until it completed a roll move and was clearly 3 bright blue lights in the shape of a triangle with red and white lights on the belly. In the few minutes seen, the object would roll back and forth showing the triangle s! hape, but then rolling back and appear as just 2 lights.  My wife, my mother in law, and I all stood in awe as we watched the object slowly lower itself as if about to land, I ran to grab a better camera as the shots and video taken on my iphone were unclear due to the night sky, to truly make out the triangle, but the color of the light was captured.

Over the past 3 weeks my brother and i always saw a florecent bright round object in the same sw direction of the sky as it always was at all times of the day and night but it was very hard to make out during the day almost to where the naked eye could never see it unless you knew it was there. The way i found out for sure was one day im bringing the trash in at 7:30am and i look up like every day and there was nothing i could see. i was walking back in and i just take a 2nd look and there were 3 thick lines of white smoke that i could see for a very long distance, but within 1min to 2min the very long thick 3 smoke lines had evaporated, it looked like to me. Which brings me to tonight, my brother and i saw the 1st craft in the sw sky like we have seen before at dark. Although we were shocked to see what we saw as it faded in and out from bright light to no light about every 4min during which time it was rotating slowly with dim colored lights under it, colo! rs ive never seen in the air. We start to see it move more aggressivley, moving all directions in very short, fast distances. it looked to us as if it was shivering like when its cold. very fast shakes but never moving to far. It did that for 5 to 6 min then it vanished, we were watching very closley and we took our eyes off it for 3-6sec and it was gone. After 5min my brother goes inside to eat and i keep looking hopeing i will see it again. Around 30min i see it again but not moving or anything it was very still with very dim colored lights on the bottom, i beielive the colors were a orange, red , and yellow, but again it was dimmed down and hard to determine. So i stand there in the middle of the street just looking up. I began feeling more or less tickeling feeling on my neck and back, also a very scary fearful feeling in my head like i was surrounded by sharks and they were taking a long time to eat me. (if you can kinda understand that just toying with me in a way). I! turn around very fast and looked pin point at this bus leagnt! h flat o val about 50 miters from the ground hovering and moving very slowly forward in the direction of the other craft. It had 2 big square lights at each end of the back of it like tail lights but far brighter then anything on the other craft.(the square lights were bright white almost with a hint of blue, cause i starred at them after it passed over my neibores 4 houses down and remember about 50 to 70 miters of the ground. A very amazing thing happened to me when that 2nd craft came in to real clear view, it looked like a oval pancake with 2 jumbo sized helicopter prepelers on it spinning very fast, but 100% compleatley silent. The 2nd craft followed in the direction of the 1st craft untill they became out of sight over some woods and a neiborhood. After that i ran home to think about what happened. and right when i was running across the street 3 small roundish balls, they had like a shinney gray color a color that i could not relate to anything that i have seen before. As i lo! oked at the objects they begain 1 at a time to extend this long bindable rod of some sort, still connected to them. No noise was made by them. They gradually lifted of into the sky at a slow rate untill they eventually were out of sight, took about 20min. So by that time we could hear a load of helicopters moving in that direction. And that was about it, i wish i could remember more, i was just so damn scared and in shock it felt like. I trully regreat to inform you that i have no physical proof. The only proof i kinda have is that it has been returning alot over the month. I promise i will get the evidence you need.

On the night of 12th to 13th of September 2010 (00:51am) i was sitting on a rooftop-terrace with two other young people. Cordoba,Spain. Suddenly one of them pointed into the dark,clear sky and asked: What is that?!  Now the three of us all looked up and saw 1 ball in the sky,wich, from our view from the ground,had the size of a marble. The color was white,grey,lightblue. A soft color that made it looked like a pearl. And from our view it moved horizontal,straight line,from right to left.(NW-SE)  The object moved fast,accelerated and with an amazing speed it flew from one end to the other end of the sky.That was in just about 3 seconds!! (There was no sound)  I knew that i had seen a few videos on the internet of this kind of sightings before.The ball looked exactly like an orb as can be seen on orbwar.com.!   My belief... Personally i too believe that it was Human-made. and that there was advanced technology inside.(f.e. because of acceleration) I believe the ball was a cover for both vision and sound for what was hidden inside. A result of advanced,American,stealth technology,hidden from public. The speed of the object puzzles me even most. I believe that someday in the near future,there will be many more of those balls to be seen flying in the sky.WW III.This war will affect all nations of this planet. It will be a chemical war.The preparations are happening NOW. Ufo's like these orbs will not have aliens from outerspace inside, although the human beings inside may look like robots. When people someday will see many balls like these flying in the sky, they will be called ufo's (unidentified and unknown by most of us) and they will be mistaken for alien visitors from outerspace. (We can destroy ourselves,right? Don't need green marsians for that)  Ufo's are examples of HUMAN imagination. At some point,tech.inventors found out that not flying saucers but circle-shaped aircrafts are best for space and air travelling. A circle is a sign of perfection and without any corners. Why do you think that all the planets moving through/in the universe are shaped like balls?  So this is what i think and believe.. Anyways- i do fear this future of possible,advanced chemical war... So what do YOU believe??? (and ever seen something like i have??)",2010-11-21T00:00:00,,

While it moved in primarily a straight line, it did appear to both observers to have slight wobbles or jogs in the trajectory. It appeared much brighter than other space debris or satellites that we have seen. It traveled across about 80-90 degrees of the sky, and then gradually became less bright and then disappeared altogether.  We observed it for about 3 minutes from when we noticed it to when it faded away. It was primarily notable due to its brightness, speed, and how long it stayed visible.
