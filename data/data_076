It was approximatly 1,000ft high and at times dipping as low as 700-800 ft.   The object looked as though it was big, about the size of a small house. There were red, green and white lights and seemed to be in a somewhat triangular position.   We were looking North when we got out of the vehicle.  The object would make sudden and swift changes and would also hover during the 5 min period in which we watched this.   We took pictures of it, one zoomed out so you can see where its located, and a couple zoomed in so you can see the colors and shape.  We then tried to record it because of all the movements it was doing, and thats when our camera died. The sudden changes in direction while in flight were unexplainable.  The object would quiver in the sky and almost dance, making ""s"" and ""z"" movements, moving faster than anything we have ever witnessed.  It would jump up and down so quickly it was hard to focus your eyes on it, and then it would stop.  It would then hover and slowly rotate 360*, sometimes while moving across the span of the entire city of Arcata.  It started to move closer to us so we decided to get back in the vehicle, because we both got nervous and felt unsure about what we were seeing. As we drove North on Hwy101 we saw it above Arcata, and actually ended up passing it, the entire time us keeping a close eye on what it was doing.   Suddenly the lights would just turn off, then flash on placing the object close to where it was but in a different position in the sky.  It did that about 5-10 times then stopped and hovered.   We pulled off the Hwy at this point scared and wanted to see if there was anything else it was going to do, we pulled into a gas station and as we did so, the lights/object started towards the South side of town making it hard to see from our location.  We spotted it down on the horizon, slowly moving behind a house that was in the way.  We got gas and as fast as we could do that, it was gone.  We pulled out and continued to look for it for approx. 15 min.",2011-07-06T00:00:00,40.853795454545455,-124.05069393939394

I was up late studying some materials for work.  After I completed my studies I went outside my home for a few minutes to get some fresh air before going to bed.  I occasionally take a few minutes to clear my thoughts by looking at the starry night sky. I am very familiar with various aircraft and spacecraft types.  I live and work on the Space Coast where I have witnessed and participated in many launches of various vehicles.  What I saw on this night could not be explained by any type of vehicle or object I have ever seen.  It was a virtually cloudless night as I looked north and up at about a 45 degree angle, I was searching for the Big Dipper.  The Big Dipper has become a very familiar star pattern to me.  As I searched I saw a bright flash that I assumed to a reflection off a terrestrial satellite.   About 30 seconds passed and I saw the flash again.  This time I focused my gaze in the area of the flash.  I could see a dimly lit object moving north-north-east.  I knew that it was not an airplane due to the lack of navigation beacons.  I also realized that due to the position of the earth that it was too dark for any earthbound satellite to be reflecting the sun.  I saw another VERY bright flash about 60 seconds later again further! north and to the east of where I saw the first flash. I honestly do not know what it was that I witnessed but what I do know is that it was not anything conventionally known. It made no sound and it looked as if it was on the edge of space.

We went outside to sit on our balcony a little before 8pm, as the sun was beginning to set and as the moon was rising.  At 8:03pm I saw the first one, which was much higher than all the other ones we had seen previously.  I wouldn't have been able to see it if I hadn't been looking for it, I suppose. During the total period of time of about 30 minutes we were out there, we saw 3 airplanes.  One going over us, one taking off, and one coming in.  They had their lights on, etc.  We knew they were planes compared to these other ""floating"" objects.  The planes also have clearly visible wings and tail.  We really double-checked ourselves a lot, especially after seeing so many. Within the next few minutes, I saw 2 more very, very high (I'm not even going to try to guess how high).  They all seemed to be cigar-shaped, but were harder to make out their exact contour because they were so high, but it was clear that it was just a floating silver line with a ""tarnished"" blackish tinge. My girlfriend saw the 4th one, which took me a moment to focus in on, but was able to confirm it heading West over us.   Then after a few moments, the last one came floating by, much much lower than all the other ones of this evening and last night.  This one had a much clearer ""cigar shape"" and was silverish in color, maybe hints of darker more tarnish-y areas.  We were able to watch it glide across the sky at a steady pace for quite some time.  At one point, from my angle it almost looked like a disc that was rotating forwards right side up, like a wheel and what was most visible to us was the underside of it, making it appear to be the cigar-shape.  My girlfriend said it was not only a disc rotating, but it was also shifting from side to side, but somehow was able to keep only the ""cigar shape"" of its side visible.  I also wondered if the cigar-shape may have been a ring of light that was wrapped around an invisible cylinder that may have been floating sideways in the way a ring would fit on a finger because when the object got further away it looked to be made of light instead of silvery, but it could have also been the sun going down. We are going to look out again tonight once it gets darker to see if any of them may glow or are visible in the dark at all.  And we will certainly be watching again around the same time of 8pm.",2011-07-17T00:00:00,35.12547266265719,-89.92692482230727

It was late in the afternoon, about 19:30 when I started the session, finishing an hour later (20:30). The photo that I sent was took in during that time.  When I finish my sessions, I usually edit my photos in Photoshop (ajusting contrast, vibrance, clarity... all these are made in the .RAW format, the format of 1 of the file, the other 2 are in JPEG)  The Raw format helps by giving the user a lot more of data from the photo.   The object appears above the Sun as a disk shape, doesn't look like a cloud or bird.   Below that same object there is another one, a sphere shape object also unidentified, there is a possibility that this second one might be a wheather baloon.  Hope it helps your work, thank for your support!  And write back please, i'd really want to know what it was.  Best wishes ((NUFORC Note:  Photo indicates very small, dark, blurry object.

I live a ways outside of town and work nights from home.  I was getting something out of my car when I spotted it.  At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.  It looked like any other star in the sky, but was moving, all kinds of directions, slow then very quick.  So quick it would leave a light streak behind it, as though it were a falling star.  The view from my front yard is S-SW, facing Yellowstone Park, the object appeared to be far away in that direction, and very high up.  At one point a jet flew by and the object seemed nowhere near it, much higher.  It would sit still, then fall like a meteor, then all-of-the-sudden, it would break at a 90 degree angle, without slowing down at all.  It would streak across the horizon like nothing else, then come to an instant stop.  It didn't behave with any sort of purpose, it all seemed very random, like it was bouncing around and spinning off walls -like a foosball.  I watched it until the sun came up! and I could no longer see it.  My mind is now completely blown.  The light it gave off really looked like any other star in the sky, but it remained bright long after the stars had faded into the sunrise.  Not sure what else to say, it wasn't strange looking, it looked like a star or satellite.  It made no sound either, but again, it seemed too far away to hear.  It moved like nothing I have ever seen, for hours on end.  I had to tell someone, almost called the police, but what the heck are they going to do -other than harass me.  Tried your hotline as I was watching, but there was no answer.  Guess this is all I can do.  I took photos, 60 second open shutter shots, hoping it would show up.  It moved too much for the lens to collect its light.  The photos look like any other night sky shot, nothing interesting or believable in them.  I tried video too, but that was too dark, nothing showed up -lots of me going ""oh my god!"" in them though.  I tried to narrorate what I was s! eeing.  If you want the photos or video, just ask.  I'm mainly curious if anyone else reported it, and what to do if it's back tonight (?).  Thanks! ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a bright star or planet, we suspect.

After a very short time of observing the strange object did we notice that it was moving quite a bit in all directions at what appeared to us as a slow pace.   We then spent the next hour and a half standing in the same spot watching as the object changed shape and lighting.  Before deciding that what I was witnessing was in fact a UFO, I decided to use the app, “Google Sky” to make sure it was not just a bright star playing tricks on my eyes.  Oddly, my phone had absolutely no service, and though I can’t be sure that this and the object are related, after restarting my phone, it appeared to act normally again.   I then officially established that it was no star or planet. Sometime around 4:20 AM, I finally decided to vocalize an observation that I thought was crazy: the object appeared to have tentacle-like attachments that both my friend and I had assumed earlier, were just reflections of the lighting.  These “tentacles” often came in and out of view and at times, made it look somewhat like a jellyfish in the sky. Around 4:45, I finally decided to awaken my mother as well as my boyfriend who live about a mile down the road to get their opinion on the animal-like object.  After seeing the UFO for himself, my boyfriend then woke up his uncle and we all watched together. Around 5:00 AM, three of us watched as some type of dark flying object flew towards the UFO and, as far as we believe, connected or went inside the larger, lightened UFO.  Around the same time, we also noticed yet another flying object within a decent distance that was much smaller and  flashed lights regularly.  This object, unlike the original large one, flew the sky at what looked to me like the pace of an airplane. Around 5:40, it was clear daylight and only the original bright and animal-like object was visible. It was very obviously, as well as slowly,  heading higher and higher in the sky.  The last observation I made before leaving the scene was that the clouds were out and this tentacle having object was still beneath them rather than behind them like a planet or star would be.

I was in conversation having a smoke when I noticed a white string of balloons floating across the sky towards the west.  The angle was about 35 degrees, distance not more than 2 miles in the sky (guessing), from my sitting position.  This was no big deal but as they floated the objects started falling out of formation in the sky, kind of like RC planes.  I’m staring at them trying to make out what they were.  The shape was hard to make out because there were no distinct edges or sharp lines to make out the object shapes.  They all were similar to a balloon and had flattened edges at the sides.  On the flattened edges, one side seemed to be thicker than the other.  They all were the same size and color, white with a dark bottom.  Then I start to see them move erratically, one at a time like dominoes, going downward and at different angles like in “flat Z” free f! all, some left to right and to and from me…2-3 others moved curving towards the ground and eastward.  They moved through the sky and seemed to glimmer from the reflection of the sun as the made “falling moves with quick pivot positions” (the “flat Z” free fall). The movement would be similar to a butterfly falling from the sky.  They all changed direction at the same time, came to a weird shaped “V”, moving northeast, and with a change of angle of about 5 degrees from the Earth’s surface.  They floated in the sky away from me, back in a straight line, and then formed a “V” pointed towards the north, and it did not seem to be parallel with the ground either.  The fascinating thing is as the objects were moving this entire time through the sky they still seemed to be “floating in the wind” when not moving erratically. They dropped down about 3 inches from my vantage point in the sky when completing the “V” and went behind a roof.  I was in shock and ran through the house, gra! bbed my cell phone on the couch (try and snap a picture), and ! ran out front door.  I went in the middle of the street and witness them still flying in the “V” formation, again not parallel to the ground, towards the north and then they completely disappeared!!

I was driving home down Creve Coeur Mill Rd past the lake listening to a program on the radio  when something shiny came into view up in the sky.  It was hovering in the sky, it didn't fly by me. I think I had about a 2-3 minute view as I was driving, before the trees blocked my view.  I was seeing it at about a 67 degree angle on the horizon past the southern end of the lake, past the trees.  It was a really sunny, clear day, only a few clouds, and it was hovering below the clouds.  As I was driving I kept watching the thing and I thought  it must be a dad out flying an inflatable with his kid somewhere around the lake.  But, the shiny thing did not move or waver or flutter in the wind, and it was pretty big. Then I thought it must be a blimp.  I'm not a good judge of size or distance, but as I got closer I could see that it was not moving, it had a distinct saucer shape (two saucers on top of each other) the top was very shiny and the bottom was dark or in shadow.  It appeared to be larger than a car, but as I got closer I decided it was not the shape of a blimp or as large as a blimp.  I wanted to pull over, but the road didn't have a good place to pull off, and I figured that once I got around the trees I'd get a better view of it and there would be a place to park  down the road.  But, when I got around the trees, it was gone.  I don't think the object was right above the lake, or the trees, I think it was off in the distance and it must have been pretty big.  Larger than a car or a semi-truck, but smaller than a blimp, I'm sure.  I didn't see any lights, just the shape of it and the shiny reflection.  I thought I saw panels on it that were reflecting the sunlight.  From where I was driving south on Creve Coeur Mill Rd, it appeared to be close to Olive/Clarkson Rd, right around where the 141 construction is going on.  I'm asking myself why a UFO would be in that area.  It would have had a view of the Missouri River bottom on one side and Hwy 40-141 on the other side.

The object when I first noticed it was to my east, moving to the South with maybe just a slight Westward inclination.   After watching it for maybe a minute or so, it dawned on me that I should grab my binoculars to see exactly what it was.  I ran into the house grabbed my hunting case and the binoculars were not there.  I searched around the house for probably another minute or so and then gave up.   I went back outside and the object was still there but further away to the south.  I watched it for possibley another minute or two and then it blinked on and off about 3 maybe 4 times then just simply disapeared.   After a moment i went in the house still trying to find my binoculars.  After a short search to no avail, I stepped back on my porch and there was another object exactly like the first one traveling the exact same path as the first.  I watched it for probably 3 minutes or so and then it dissapeared too.   Both objects seemed to follow static lines across the sky, neither going up or down. I would describe them as round perhaps 4 to 5x as bright as the brightest star, red in color with perhaps a shade of gold or oranges tint toward the center.   I am not sure which direction the wind was from that night but it was negligable. My first thought was that they were some kind of Firework, but to my knowledge nothing is going to stay in the air for that long and move in such an exact manner.

They eventually turned to the right and seemed to be on top of each other and then they flew all most out of sight.   We came inside and I called the police and reported it and asked if anyone else had seen it and they said they hadn't reciev! ed any calls as of yet.  I than powered up my pc to get the UFO Hotline and called them and reported it.   After I spoke to him, I checked my camera and we only saw 2 orange lights but the camera picked up 4 blinking orange and blue lights.   I than went back outside and there was set's of 2 lights in the sky everywhere it seemed like hundreds of them, I ran back to the phone to call the hotline back to report them.  They are still out there at 1:39 am, they look like stars but if anyone look's close every light has a second light the same distance from it  and there are groups of 2 lights all over the sky.   There are so many here I can't find the big dipper.  I called a friend of mine in Elkhart Indiana to tell him what I saw and after I told him he said he was driving back from Chicago, IL, and saw some strange light's in the sky as well and when I told him about the light's that I am still seeing he described the same thing to me.

She told us that she saw this rectangular shaped object it was really bright and she saw it dim a little and out of nowhere it shot straight up into the sky.   I had told her to report it on some ufo report site to see if anyone else might have seen it.  The funny thing was that one of her guy friends had posted on facebook that he witnessed something similar to her story (the 4th of july, a day after her sighting). Coming home from work, we pass a little town called piru (about 5 minutes away from fillmore) anyways, about 2 minutes away from piru on top of a mountain, my friend points out and yells, ""That’s it right there!""   We saw a short glimpse of  what appears to be a rectangular shaped object but it looked as if there was a tall bright antenna  on top of it..  Everything was lit up, it almost reminded me of a long rectangular circus hut because from the antenna, it looked 2 be lights connecting to the ends of the craft to the sides or the top of the antenna.   Another unique thing about it was it looked almost if there where windows!  Some lit and some not.. like one yes next no, one yes, next no. the lights on the antanna and the ones connecting looked almost like small round lights (like x-mas lights u hang on your house) but inside the window looking things it was illuminating from the inside.   We lost sight of it because the mountain covered it because of our drivi! ng straight.  I told her to turn back but she didn’t want to.   The distance from us to the object was about 300 - 400 yards away (idk if im calculating it right because of the height, but it was a little mountain) but the mountain from the road we were driving on was about 100 yards.  It looked like a long version of a huge house (one story house).  And when we couldn’t see it, we can still see a glow behind the mountain that was covering it.

I am assuming that the three lights were on an object, I could not make out any structure between the lights. The object was passing in and out of the bottom of the clouds, although it never became fully obscured.  The MDW TAF says that there is a broken cloud layer at 5000 and a scattered layer at 12000, although the sighting was two hours previous to me checking the TAF. What I thought was odd was that the craft didn't have any beacons or navigation lights.  All I could see was the three simultaneously strobing white lights. There were other aircraft in the sky, there were two helicopters circling almost constantly. For background I am a professional aircraft mechanic and have worked at O'Hare for the past 22 years.

Detailed Story's Of A Desert Boy. I've Reported here before  I never followed up because I was scared.  I think its finally time to talk... I was in my back yard, and my dog was barking like crazy, i was trying to get her to be quiet, she kept running back and fourth in the yard, jumping up the fence, like as if chasing a cat... she was barking and she sat in the middle of the yard. and i finally got up one last time to bring her inside, but as soon as i got next to her she stopped barking. it was so silent. at night, you can see the stars... for the most part... there wasn't any. it was pitch black. i mean, NOTHING. it, the stars i mean, were in the shape of a ellipse, but i don't know for sure. my phone broke, like, literally. broke. the battery was dripping. i don't know what happened next. i woke up in my room and i haven't talked to anyone except for one person. The second encounter i had, which I've sent before, was in my living room. in the morning. the sun was barely rising. it was around 4 or 5, summer. and i looked out the window. and. there it was. clear as day. a being. Its face was like a bony mans, very skinny, sucked in to the bone.  it had no eyes. no nose. it had holes on the sides of its head, which, i thought were like a reptiles ears. but this was pale, flesh. it looked human. but it had the slightest green in it. blue in some spots. it was tall, but hunched over, it had four arms, and very small legs. it had a very large spine, like, it was long, and it was very prominent, very easy to see through its flesh. it had something else, where our ribs would be.  It looked like gills, they were bright pink. no tail.  I dropped my glass of milk and he/it turned to look at me.  It stared. for what felt like hours...  I know exactly what it looks like.  I could almost feel the creature through the glass.  I blacked out.  I woke up lat! er around 12. And lastly. the reason why I reported this entire three story's.  was because i was in page with a friend, hes Navajo , and he took  me to meet his family on the reservation. that first night, we went out at about 12, we got up, on top of this huge sandstone ridge, and he said that his father told him never to leave at night, blah blah blah right? i'm a boy, i'm 14. i didn't listen. mind you i'm a very intelligent 14 year old boy. I should have listened.  There was a bright light.  illuminated the valley. it was a bright as day, it grew brighter and brighter. and then it kind of coned into a small area, like a stage light.  but really bright, we could feel the heat, and it was very cold. anyway, the cone of light grew so small you could barely see it, yet it grew hotter and hotter. it was like a laser. technically, by definition a light is a laser. but whatever.   BACK TO THE STORY.  A loud buzzing sound started, it was a low hum, then a loud ring. then. complete silence but it was! bright, the light sketched across the sand like lighting or a crack in the ice. we ran faster then I've ran before. *living in the ghettos of Arizona, especially being white, you have a lot of things to run from*   We decided to walk back to the sands after last night, and we walked out there, and it was over cast, raining.... but the rain was caught and wouldn't sink more then a few feet inches. we dug in. for a radius of thirty feet, there was glass.  It looked like a spider web on the top, with a plate under it. we dug it up and, it looked random to me, but who knows, the father said to leave it and its gods work, its not for the media, so we buried it. Shortly after the mans cattle and sheep started to disappear. I NEED a follow up please, i really want this to be at least seen by someone.  I almost feel like the one person i told doesn't believe me…",2011-07-06T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

I ran out onto the balcony, (we're on the third and top floor of an old brownstone type building with clear views over towards Mount-Royal) and I saw two morphing golden glowing disks about a mile up in the sky.

They were flying in formation a few hundred feet away from each other, one slightly ahead of and above the other.  They seemed to be quite large, around the size of a small passenger plane, perhaps larger. My friend says their shape was originally flat, but they had morphed into ovals and disks by the time I got there.  They were flying across the sky at a slight incline at a moderate pace, similar to the speed of an airplane.  They flew roughly towards the sun and then accelerated and turned 180 degrees on a dime and flew back in the direction they came from.  Nothing I've ever seen in my life accelerates BEFORE turning 180 degrees in mid-air, and there were TWO of them flying in tandem.  They seemed to fly very much like the UFOs in many other videos I've seen recently, specifically, the ones over the BBC offices in London.

Another orb appeared on the horizon line in front of me and seemed to be headed right for me, but it also ascended and joined the others far ahead of me, very high in the sky,  I counted 8 all together.  They were all yellowish white, occasionally one of them would throw off what looked like and orange flare.!  They circled each other fairly slowly and asymmetrically.   At that point I got in my car and continued to try to follow them as I stayed in communication with my family and they reported seeing the same thing.   When we finally met up they were gone.   This took about 20 minutes from my sighting of the orb to the multiple orbs disappearing. ((NUFORC Note:    PD))",2011-07-17T00:00:00,42.36979999999999,-76.9566

What we had seen was a green fireball like object jet across the window exposure wickedly fast.  There was a small trail behind it but quickly dissipated.  The fireball then vanished into the sky while moving south west.

It was seen traveling in the same south west direction.  My lady didn't necessarily believe me until this evening.  I can say what we saw this evening lasted roughly 12-15 seconds.  In our prior living space we had north west exposures so I know it had come from that direction.  Tonight It just appeared west and travelled south west.

I was very concerned and asked her son and my son and one of our nephews to drive with me to find her, mostly to make sure she was all right since she was all alone driving in the dark. We left Watkins Glen and turned up the hill on Rt. 79 at its intersection with Rt. 227. Once we reached the top of the ridge, my son who was driving and our nephew who was in the front seat of the van started yelling that they were seeing something, and my sister’s son joined them in the front and also started spotting these lights. I am older and don’t see as well at night as they do, but I did move to the front of the van to see. I could make out three lights moving much faster and more erratically than any plane or helicopter could, traveling first in the sky over Ithaca ahead of us (due east) and then whipping around to swing in the sky to our left, which would be northeast. Their movements were unpredictable, very swift, and jerky. The lights I saw seemed to have a reddish-amber cast alternating with a yellow-white color. They were very far away and very high in the sky. I am president and owner (with my husband) of an editorial services firm, college-educated, in my late 50s. I do not seek after paranormal or other-worldly events and was only along on this ride because I wanted to make sure my sister was all right. Though I definitely did see something that was not like anything I had seen in the sky before, I have no theories about what those lights might have been nor am I in a big hurry to find out.

Finally, this thing moved overhead so I was looking at the underneath part as it flew over.  I saw 3 red lights on three triangular shapes, connected to whatever the main part of the body was.  It flew over and went from the southwest sky toward the eastern sky.  It went over about 2 large fields’ length, then I w! atched it bounce a bit again, before it faded and began to look like one of the stars.  This is when I texted my sister next door to get over to my front porch (where I went after I couldn’t see it from the back anymore).   We waited two minutes, just watching the sky for anything out of the ordinary, when suddenly we looked in the same direction the thing had disappeared into, and just a couple of fields over, there was an amazingly bright light hovering in the tree line; the light stayed red a few seconds then switched to white, then back to red, it glowed.   My sister and I watched, not taking our eyes off of this thing. It looked like it was staying in a small patterned area, because it hovered, then moved slightly to another nearby location, then moved again to another nearby location.  It was almost as if it was searching for something.  We watched it another couple of minutes, then the bright red light faded out, just like that.   My sister and I immediately heard clicking no! ises; first from the field area, then closer to my house (all the while we were still on the front porch).  That was enough to make us want to come back in.  I’ve been watching certain ""orbs"" of light actively move in the same area of the sky night after night (for the past many months), and always watch them sway side to side some, then move fluidly up and down; sometimes going from one area to another.   I would really love for someone to contact me about this.  Thank you.",2011-07-06T00:00:00,46.9743,-68.1449

After speaking to her on the phone for a few minutes, I got into the car with my mother and two of my cousins, one of whom is the son of my Aunt to whom we’d been speaking, to find my Aunt since she sounded frightened.  My mother called local police who asked if my Aunt needed assistance, and since we did not know, they advised us they couldn’t do anything. We got onto Highway 79 at the intersection of Highway 227 heading East toward Ithaca, still communicating with my Aunt; it was at that intersection that she had told us she first saw a large glowing orb and then up to 7 other moving, pulsing lights as she continued.  We saw nothing, but as we crested the first hill, I saw two lights over the trees, at a high altitude, to my right (South) pulsing and alerted my cousins and my mother.  We watched these lights for a few moments, debating on whether or not they were stars at first.  Both lights were blinking/pulsing very rapidly and then they moved across the highway to our North and joined with a third blinking light.  During this transition, there were a few aircraft flying toward Ithaca, and we were able to compare these lights to the light of a commercial aircraft, and the two were definitely not the same. We observed these lights for nearly 10 minutes and our movement during this time resulted in the lights slowly shifting to the north of us so that I could no longer see them from my position in the driver’s seat without completely ignoring the road.  At this point, my cousins (my mother was in the backseat talking with my Aunt on the phone and no longer actively observing) began to get very excited, saying there was a fourth object that joined the other three, which had maneuvered into a triangle formation at that point.  My Aunt’s son said that if he observed the three lights that were in the triangle formation through the tinted rear windows of our van that he could make out a huge, dark triangle shape with the lights at its corners.  He also reported that the fourth object “flashed” and disappeared. As we entered Ithaca, we lost sight of the objects and met up with my Aunt, and observed local air traffic for nearly twenty minutes so that we could confirm none of us could see the objects we had previously seen any longer. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other two reports from Watkins Glen for this date.  We spoke with one of the witnesses via telephone, and we found her to be exceptionally objective and eloquent in her description of her sighting.  PD))",2011-07-17T00:00:00,42.36979999999999,-76.9566

At the time and date specified I was looking through the south-facing window of my top floor apartment.  The weather was clear with only high wispy cirrus clouds. I noticed an oval-shaped object which was quite some distance away, almost due south (SSE), and travelling westerly, with a color of white much like a cloud.  I would estimate the object to be three to four miles distant, and its size to be at about five or six jumbo jets in length.  Its height was approximately half its length.  The ends of the oval-shaped object appeared to be perfect semi-circles in shape, while the top and bottom were flat and horizontal, much like the “Begin” and “End” shapes on a flowchart symbol template. Since I live near Wrigley Field, where the Chicago Cubs play, I first assumed it to be an advertising blimp.  Wrigley Field often employs a blimp to circle the field with a promotional message during games.  But the object was as far distant south from Wrigley Field as I was (at least three miles), and though at first I did not think much of the object, what caught my attention was the enormous speed it would have to be travelling-much too fast to be a blimp.  Using my estimate as to distance and size of object, I estimate the object to have been travelling at about 300 miles per hour.  I will emphasize again that the object was very large. When the westward-travelling object got due south of me it made a gradual left turn and headed due south so I was viewing it end on.  It continued travelling south, but instead of slowly getting smaller with distance it seemed to quickly (within two seconds) fade from my sight altogether, which I thought was strange. Note:  I checked the Cubs schedule and they will be playing at home against the Florida Marlins starting at 7:05 p.m. tonight, some two hours after my sighting.   I went outdoors at 5:30 p. m. to check for an advertising blimp, but found none.",2011-07-17T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

The light was the same color as the other stars in the sky, a bright white with no flicker.  As I inspected the light I noticed that it was too high up to be a plane around Dallas (my house is right underneath the regular flight patterns for incoming planes into Love Field and DFW Airports) and it was moving too slowly to be a shooting star.   I thought it might have been a satellite due to the size of the light and the steady speed, but after 10 seconds the brightness swelled (not like a flash, but like someone manually changing the intensity of an indoor LED light) and dimmed back down, with the light beginning moving in a small zigzag or spiral pattern before it disappeared.

First off I would like to say that I am colorblind, so I’m not so sure about the color but I would have to say that they where an orangeish-red. Anyway, I am an overnight janitor that works all over Lansing throughout the night going from account to account. At about 10:20 pm I had pulled up to an account  roughly on the corner of Fairview and Grand River. I had backed my truck up so that I was facing north as I always do when  I received a phone call from my boss.	 	 The conversation went on for about ten minutes (about 10:30pm now) I noticed the first object out of the corner of my eye. It was an aspirin-sized reddish light that was moving quite slow coming from the north-west just over the top view on the two storied building to my left moving vary steadily to the east. After about five seconds two or three exact same size and shape objects faded into view just in front of the first one, followed by another small grouping. All moving at the EXACT same speed and never breaking there formation witch was nothing really impressive. At this time I interrupted my boss and was begging him to go outside and look to the north. He was at a location just southeast about a quarter mile from my location. The objects, seven or eight total, never making a noise started to fade out one by one after traveling half way across the sky. By the time that the last one made it to the far right (north-east) of me, my boss finally made it outside and at least confirmed the sighting of the last one left. He confirmed the location and the color, but said that it was flickering before it diapered, and overall was not impressed. I on the other hand saw the whole thing and can say that not one of the objects ever blinked or flickered even once. The whole incident lasted somewhere between thirty and sixty seconds, and the objects moved slow and very steady. In fact I can remember thinking that they may be helicopters, But once again, no sound at all, no blinking lights, and why would they fade in and out?  I have very little knowledge of aircraft, spatial differences, speeds and heights of normal objects in the sky , But I can safely say that They where NOT Meteors. They did not move nearly fast enough or leave tracers or tails. I have seen my share of them. I also know that the direction that the objects came from was in the area of the Lansing international airport. So hopefully that will help in finding some answers.

I was stunned at what I was seeing and I started yelling for my boyfriend to “get out here”.  Once he stepped outside he saw exactly what I was seeing. As we watched, I would say it all took place over maybe a 5 to7 minute period.  They moved horizontally towards the North while appearing to gain altitude and one by one they would disappear.  Then, we noticed another one approaching from the West beginning at the horizon, just above a distant tree line, moving in the same direction as all the others.  Then there were more coming from the same direction totaling 12 to 13 and they faded away one by one in roughly the same location in the North.  During the entire occurrence there was no sound. We tried to take pictures and video, but nothing was clear.  We live on the outer edge of the city, so the sky is not affected by the city lights.  There are only a few street lights in the subdivision.  Also, I am very familiar with planes, stars and even shooting stars out here and these objects we saw were none of these. Once everything was over, we were both in shock.  I called one of the local news stations to find out if there were any reports and I was told none were called in.  I then called the airport (knowing these were not planes) and asked if they had any planes taking off or landing at that time.  As I was speaking with a gentleman at the airport, he told me they had one that was supposed to land at 9:30 p.m., but was running late and at that point I saw it flying across the sky and it looked nothing like what we had seen previously.  It was moving across the sky at a much more rapid pace.  I searched the internet for any other reports last night and this morning, but I found nothing.

On July 15, 2011, at about 11:15 p.m., I saw a strange light above the SeaTac Airport below the cloud cover in SeaTac, WA. I was driving East on S 170th Street (just passing 31st Avenue S, by the Master Park Lot B), when I first saw the light South-South-East of me directly over the airport.  As I came to the stoplight at the intersection of S 170th and Pacific Highway South I could see that the whitish/yellowish light was moving North.  It seemed like it was travelling right through the middle of the airport.   The light was not flashing or blinking, it appeared to be a single light.  It moved at about the speed you might see a helicopter moving at, like the ones I see leaving the Renton Airfield all the time.  But this was definitely not a helicopter and I’m not an expert or anything, but I know helicopters don’t fly directly over the airport like that. I turned right (North) on Pacific Hwy after sitting at the stop light and watching this strange light.  It was out of my view at this point.  When I reached the next stop light at the cemetery, I turned around to see where and what the light was.  I could see it through the trees in the cemetery now, and it was beginning to turn to the East, toward Burien.  I returned to the intersection of Pacific Hwy S and S 170th St. again, this time turning right (East) back onto S 170th and continuing on Eastbound. The light was in full view, directly out in front of me in the distance, as I passed under the overpass on S 170th.  I watched it from the stop sign.  The light seemed to fade in and out once; not blink or flash, but gradually disappear and then come back.  I could see that it was moving away from me to the East and slightly North and then it seemed to just disappear into the clouds over Burien area. This all took place over a course of about 10-12 minutes.  The light was small; it looked like about the size of a large start might look, except this was obviously in our atmosphere and below the cloud cover.  The height in the sky was maybe 30-50 deg. off my horizon.  I’m not real good at estimating the height, but I can say it was definitely not more than 50 deg., as I was able to see it in my peripheral without having to look up much to see it.  That’s how it caught my eye, I noticed it moving out of the corner of my eye. This statement is true and without falsehood and to the best of my recollection.

I am located in Penfield, NY, a suburb of Rochester, NY.  The lights made no sound of any kind. They were completely silent. The first appeared alone moving from the east to west and about 45 degrees above the horizon.  It continued to ascend but moving in an arc so that as it rose it also moved further from us.  The light didn’t fade out completely it just kind of turned off. Immediately after witnessing the first one, 5-6 more arrived over the tree line in the exact place where the first was seen and followed the same path as the first.  They seemed to move back and forth with each as they flew.  Meaning that the distance between each ball of light was never constant. Each ball of light did not blink as an airplane would.  It also did not have multiple lights as an airplane. These were solid fire orange lights. After this group flicked out. Another group of 4 came across following the same pattern.  While they were flying I ran to get my camera but upon my return they were too far away and again seemed to just turn off. About 3 minutes after another lone light appeared and followed the same pattern and turned out as it went high into the night sky. Each of these lights did not move fast, they did not leave a trail of light.  They flew in some sort of formation.  I would guess that it took about 30-45 seconds for each group to make their flight across the sky. This occurrence was observed by myself, my wife and our 2 children who are 6 and 8.

I went downstairs and looked out the back screen door and saw a big ball of red/orange light.  The best way to describe it is that it looked like a big ball that was on fire. It was changing from bright red to orange.  It had a haze surrounding it that looked like it was on fire.  It moved from South to North, very slowly and seemed to stop at certain times.  It seemed to be moving upwards. When it got over the tree tops, we lost it.  We saw it for about 3-4 minutes. After we lost sight of it, we ventured outside to take a look around.  We stood out there for about a minute looking at the trees ahead of us when my mom looked suddenly to the right of us and there was another one.   And it literally was right above our heads.  Unfortunately, I’m terrible with distance and size, so I can’t say how high off the ground or how big it was, but it seemed very big.  It was definitely lower than an airplane.  And very close.  Too close, so we both ran as fast into the house as possible.  From the safety of our house, we watched the second one follow the exact same travel path as the first.  This one lasted about 4-5 minutes. The movements of both were the same, moved from South to North, moved slowly and very controlled, every now and then seemed to stop along the way and just kind of hover and possibly move in stationary circles for a few seconds.  Both had very intense bright fire-like glows that seemed to change between red and orange.  They both seemed to have a haze surrounding them which, best described, looked as if they were surrounded in flames or fire.   We never saw any sort of blinking or flashing lights, just shifting of colors.  Neither object had tails or emitted any sound. And they both seemed to move upwards as they went along.  We never saw the two objects together, just one at a time.  So there is a possibility the second one was the first one that circled back around.  Though we never saw it appear, we just looked up and it was overhead.  I don’t know where it came from. I can honestly say, and my mom agrees, that was the scariest experience of our lives.  We couldn’t run fast enough to get back in the house.  I am regretting not grabbing a camera or something. But at the time it was happening, we were memorized just staring at it and trying to figure out what it could possibly be.   And we are still baffled.",2011-07-17T00:00:00,41.2388,-81.8315

I had gotten off work a little earlier than usual (it was between 4-5am) and was driving along US 2 & 41 M-35 north headed home to Gladstone.  I came along the stretch of Highway right before Gladstone where you travel along lake Michigan for about a mile or so and happened to look up at the sky over the bay.  What I saw has changed my life.   I saw three very bright lights. I would describe them as being as bright as the brightest stars in the night sky. But these were not stars, satellites, meteors, planes, jets, ball lightning, etc. .   All three of these lights were traveling very fast and turning around each other in a very erratic manner. They would come close to each other and twist around each other making 90 degree turns without slowing down or touching.  These strange maneuvers lasted about 10 seconds.   Then all three lights spread out along the horizon, stopped, and then streaked north simultaneously at a fantastic rate of speed.  Now I have watched the sky for years and have never seen anything like this.  These could not have had human pilots as they should not be able to withstand the forces involved in making 90 degree turns without slowing down (from what I have read the laws of physics would have some problems with this also)or traveling at the speeds I saw.   I have also seen plenty of aircraft over the years from the KI Sawyer Air Force base north of here when it was still operational and this was nothing like any of those. (It closed in the1990s)   When I had seen this I had thought that this was a once in a lifetime experience but I was wrong.  Two weeks later as a friend and I walked out of my house at around 2am we both happened to look up and saw one of those same lights speed above us, stop, and then streak north just like the last time except I was below them this time.

It then made a lateral movement with no sound and took off back towards the direction it came so fast I could not follow it with my eyes.   I started getting out of my truck but just drove home and convinced myself it was nothing.   I have not spoken of it since now but I thought it may help someone out there or I know what we saw that night.   I know the military choppers are always doing maneuvers in that area, I just wish I knew what really happened and what it is was.   I have seen a lot of aircraft and know what they should be able to do and this should not have been able to have been completed.  The stop, acceleration and speed were like nothing I have ever seen.   Best of luck to all, I hope this helps. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Hi Peter,  I save up my Rense Radio listening over a one week period and today was my day to go to the recent broadcast archives. The gentleman that reported an unusual object about three hours before your interview saw very much the same thing I saw last summer. I have a background in physics and engineering and have over 50 years experience related to civil and military aircraft, (my father was a pilot in the air force and he and I built a 2 place homebuilt aircraft from scratch). Needless to say, I have a love affair with aircraft and any time one flies over, I can’t help to look up and admire it. I live in a farmhouse that is on the North approach route to Pearson International Airport in Toronto. About this time last year around noon while working outside, I heard an airliner on approach to the east of our house. Approximate altitude was 10,000 feet, and about 5 miles downrange to the east. Atmospheric conditions were very clear and cloudless. When the aircraft’s heading was tangential to my point of observation, I noticed a very bright luminous ball of white light suddenly appear over the wingtip of the airliner.  At first I thought it was caused by tip vortex condensation, but this was hardly something that would happen to a throttled back airliner on approach pulling only 1 g.   Besides, the form of the ball was not a trail, as in tip vortex condensation, and was very luminous. I had never seen anything like it.  What really dispelled any vortex cause was when the ball rose rather quickly vertical to the wing section and over the fuselage.  It then quickly progressed forward to the cockpit but before reaching it, vanished. And that was it. The whole observation occurred within a maximum of 5 seconds.",2011-06-27T00:00:00,,

Blinding bright!   It was about 15-20 miles east-south east.  It was heading straight line towards our direction.   I slowed down, let others pass because I was curious!  It didn't seem quite right. It headed our way with a straight and steady pace.  As it got closer I became sure it wasn't typical aircraft.  When it was about 1/4 mile away I started to be able to see what it was, a maybe football field sized object, & shaped.  There were 4 lights on the corners and one larger light in the center.

I am a local person to the area I live in and always have been.  I grew up in the countryside, so to speak and have never seen anything as unusual as this sighting I am reporting to you. To my huge regret I did not record the date and time of the sighting, but it was some time over the festive period of 2010/2011.  I am not claiming to have seen an Alien spacecraft,  I just cannot identify what I saw in the sky that day. An orange ball of light, which is the only way I can describe this thing, appeared above the rooftops of the houses, which are bungalows, on the opposite side of my street and continued, at a steady pace of about 35/45 mph, to travel in a north,  north west direction and over the rooftops of the houses of my street.  This ball of light was travelling at the height of about 3, 2story houses, and was about 8 houses away from me, so not very far at all.  It was completely silent to my surprise, as I was waiting for a roar of an engine, but there wasn't one, I could just here the birds tweeting and the odd car engine in the distance from the streets beyond.  It was broad daylight, there were a few clouds in the sky and so it was very clear to me where the spherical object was and how big it was.  If you were to draw a circle around a helicopter, including the props, that is probably how big it was, it seemed to be travelling at about the same speed as you would see a helicopter t! ravelling and in a very straight line. This orange ball of light was like nothing I have ever seen before and probably never will again, although I eagerly await its return.  Since I saw this I have become quite obsessed with watching the sky whenever I can and watching relevant programs on T.V.  I have also been keeping my camera with me, at the ready, where ever I go. I can say that I have become a believer, so to speak, in that there is something happening or going on that the majority of people are unaware of. I just happened to be standing, outside my back door, having a cigarette and there it was right in front of my eyes for many seconds. I was then, still now and always will be 100% sure of what I saw.  This changed the way I think about related issues.  Unfortunately, the naivety of people in general prevents most of them from understanding and believing you because they have not seen to believe.  Not that I blame them for that but for example, some suggestions to explain my sighting have been, a Chinese lantern or several of these tied together.  Or because I likened my sighting to a helicopter in size, someone said ""couldn't it have been a helicopter"",  please. I can also report that my mother, who lives in a nearby valley, has seen a large, cigar shaped object, hovering  outside one of her neighbours houses on the opposite side of the valley, as if it was looking into the house through the windows.  She observed the object for several minutes, then decided to rush into her house for her camera but when she came back out the object had gone.  She believes my story 100% as I do hers. My experience was within weeks if not days of an 'earthquake' measuring 3.6 which shook houses throughout the area accompanied by a loud rumble which lasted several seconds, the epicentre of which is only a few miles away,  at a place called Coniston.  One of my very creditable workmates said that, as he and a friend came out of a pub in the nearby area, fair enough they had had a few,  they observed ""two orange balls of light"" above Coniston which they thought were very strange.  They carried on observing the lights, as they chatted for several minutes, until the lights simply disappeared.   This accompanied with some very strange whether patterns and all being around the same time is beginning to become quite a concern or perhaps just very interesting to me.  If anyone can tell me what the orange ball of light is, you will be doing me and my overactive mind a massive favour.   Please don’t say,  ""Oh, it could be ball lightening,"" or something like that.  I want to know the truth.",2011-06-27T00:00:00,,

Friday, June 10, 2011, was one night sighting that I’m not yet to forget.  In less than a hour, from 21 h 52 to 22h45, I have captured 4 sightings with my HD camcorder, including an encounter with an object at 600 feet from me, a small object, but very unpredictable... The first sighting is a surprising object that when seen far, looked like a plane, but when zoomed on it, revealed to be constantly shifting in an imprecise shape.  The only constant thing about it was a main bright light and some smaller one blinking at times.  Around the shifting body were some sort of fast moving ""legs,"" or ""hair,"" or it was some kind of energy that was emitted that took strange forms.  The object looked definitely alive.   The second sighting occurred a few minutes later over the fields.  A bright intense light was first seen moving in the sky in my direction.  The light looked like the headlight of a plane as when it is facing us.  While it was coming my way, the light started to shift as if something had moved in front of it.   It continued to approach then turned left in front of me and revealed two big balls next to each other, a white and a red one.  The balls flashed at some times like a plane does, but it was no plane.  The balls expanded and retracted themselves, all the while blinking at times.  The red ball morphed completely to a small white object, then morphed back to its initial form. The third object was a bright white sphere that took the same direction as the previous object and moved slowly over the fields.  As it turned left, it started to pulsate lightly like a plane for a few seconds, before shutting off its bright main light, and keeping smaller blinking lights on.  As the 2 previous objects, it was silent and disappeared behind the trees to East direction. After filming these 3 consecutive objects in the sky, a small pulsating red light caught my attention in front of a patch of wood at about two football field distance from where I was standing in the open field.  First I thought it was someone with a flashlight or the light of a small vehicle, the little red one behind a bike maybe.  But soon, I realized after observing its behaviour, that it was completely something else.  It was a red object, about the size of a soccer ball, and was constantly making a sequence of blinking its red light, then disappeared in the dark for a few seconds, before reappearing a little further away and repeating the pulsations.   The object then went back and forth into the forest, moving around, slightly illuminating the trees from bottom to top, with a soft red color.  Unfortunately, the light was so dim that the camera didn't capture it well.  In the forest, it never pulsated but maintained a constant light.  It only pulsated at me when it was b! ack in the open field.  It was a fascinating and frightening sighting because of the object’s unpredictable behaviour.

Another 15-20 seconds it was necessary for them to fade away.  It was definitely a UFO. My friend didn’t take it seriously at first, and he didn’t get a second chance to look at it and maybe think twice, since it disappeared too fast; which means I didn’t get a chance to catch it on tape because there was just not enough time.  Fascinated by this, I have made an animation of the event that fairly describes what I have seen.",2011-06-27T00:00:00,,

UFO Sighting Report  	My 18-year-old daughter and I left the movie theatre and walked out into the parking lot on Sunday night, June 19, 2011, in Parsippany, NJ, at 11:45 pm.  The night was exceptionally black, no moon or stars, and there appeared to be high cloud cover but it made the night velvety black outside.  My daughter got excited and told me to look up in the sky. There was in Eastern horizon, a very strange, huge group of orange, yellow and red lights in the sky. Together they formed an enormous boomerang shape with the ""wing"" tips facing downwards.  It was not possible to see an exact outline of the body of the ""craft"" itself and the lights were hazy due to cloud reflection, but it was possible to see that there was some kind of dark body in a boomerang shape floating in the sky.   It hovered in one place and made no noise.  We watched it for approximately 1 minute (which seemed like an incredibly long time).  The body of this craft was, in my estimation, about the size of a baseball field.  I have never seen such an enormous object in the sky in my life.  It appeared to be hovering between 500-1,000 feet above the ground and was located about ½ mile away.  We had an excellent view because we were in a huge parking lot with no tall buildings or trees around. My daughter and I did not take our eyes off the object for one second.  Suddenly, out of no where, an orb of white light appeared on the right ""wing"" tip near the base.  I would estimate the orb had to be at least about 10 feet in diameter.  It did not have the jagged, uneven, reflective quality of an airplane wing light.  At no time did it generate any long beams of light - it remained perfectly round.   The orb was exceptionally well defined in its contoured outline, in stark contrast to the other yellow, orange and red glowing lights around this craft.  The orb light was not like the kind of lights you normally see, like street lights, airplane or helicopter lights, building lights, radio tower lights, or field lights which tend to have an intense pinpoint of light in the center and star-like beams that emanate outwards.  The orb light had a completely even-toned luminosity. All of a sudden, this white orb began traveling along a rather weird pathway.  It moved from the tip of the ""wing"" to the center of the body of the craft.  It appeared to do some kind of loopty-loop – some fancy circular motions near the left hand side of the craft.  Then, it disappeared momentarily behind the craft and reappeared at the top mid-section of the craft.  It traveled down the right hand side and stopped again at the location at the tip of the ""wing"" where it had originally appeared.   What was odd was that 1) despite its movement it never changed into a beam of light, but remained perfectly round in shape and 2) its movement appeared to be guided intelligently and it was independent of the body of the ""craft.""  In other words, the orb seemed to be a separate entity. Several seconds after the white orb stopped its voyage around the craft, the entire craft began to disappear.  It did not ""disappear"" in the sense that you could see it began to travel away in the sky by becoming smaller in size or changing location.  It simply seemed to erase itself!  The lights and dark ""body"" of the craft on the ""wing"" tips simply disappeared.  Then the ""wings"" disappeared.  Then the center of the craft simply blipped out of sight.  In a final ""blip"" the entire craft was gone.  Even the dark ""body"" of the craft was simply gone.  There was nothing at all left in the sky. Neither of us had ever witnessed anything like this before in our lives. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be quite eloquent and seemingly serious-minded.  We suspect that she is a highly capable, and reliable, witness.  PD))",2011-06-27T00:00:00,40.8597,-74.4026

I stepped out onto my 28th story balcony to see what why the sky was so lit up at 10:30 at night.  I immediately noticed an unusual aircraft at the center of the illuminated sky.  My initial reaction was that it was some new kind of advertising blimp with flashy lights.   As I continued to study the aircraft I realized how unfamiliar and strange it appeared and it seemed to be flying too high above the city to be advertising anything legible.

If someone could look at my photos and videos and get back to me I would appreciate it. Did anyone else see this???",2011-06-27T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

It seemed to have manifested out of nothing and traveled, from my perspective, what seemed like in inches.  Then disappeared as quickly as it appeared. It was round, but only in the sense that light is ""round.""  It had a sort of light around it too, but it could have just been me seeing the light from whatever I saw shining around it. Looking out the window, it was in the northeastern part of the sky.  It seemed to be a bit closer to me than a plane would be and it was brighter.  The light was not flashing.  It also seemed to traveling faster.  But I can’t be totally sure, I keep slowing the event down in my mind to try to understand. What truly irked me about this was that earlier in the night, I saw a shooting star.  It was quite dim, and was traveling horizontally to the horizon in the western sky.  And the night before last I went out to my car to get my cell phone and I saw a shooting star then.  But it seemed very close and very bright.  But this light was more of a white-blue color.  And it traveled down in the western sky. I think it was only in the sky for a few seconds, but it went behind trees.  It was still bright enough to see through the tops of trees but I can’t be sure how long it was actually there. I am 19 years old.  I have always believed in life beyond our planet.  But I had never seen evidence of it. I do not get paranoid.  I do not subscribe to conspiracy theories.  I am very skeptical about most things.

In the sky at roughly a 35 degree angle to the horizon, I observed a light brown cube approximately the size of a sugar-cube, or dime, at arm's length. I assumed the object was some kind of balloon.  However, although the weather was extremely unsettled, a mix of storm-clouds and sunshine, the cube did not appear to move. The surface of the cube appeared very smooth almost like it was coated with vinyl. However, there was no shine or reflection off the surface of the object. The object was stationary, at the edge of some storm clouds, and it seemed likely they would shortly close around it.  I had to watch my driving and quickly lost sight of the object, because the highway swung so that the object was now directly behind me. Total time of the sighting was probably 10-15 seconds. Because the storm clouds had edged around the object, I know it was in the sky and not an outdoor light fixture, etc., giving the appearance of an object.  It was also like nothing I had ever seen, or expected to see. This is my first unknown sighting. I'm 64 years old, in good health and not seeking publicity. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else in Northwestern Washington State observed anything similar to this.",2011-06-27T00:00:00,47.92466490727532,-122.21939985734664

Appeared to change shape several times My brother and I were sitting in our car in the parking lot across from RiteAid and Save-A-Lot at the plaza in Pikeville.  Our parents were in Save-A-Lots to buy a few things, while my brother and I sat in the car with our dog. Around 8:30-8:40 pm, my brother and I witnessed an object in the sky above the section of town around Magic Mart and the Windmill Restaurant.  There are two radio tower-like structures on the hills in this direction, making a football goal formation.  The object remained in this general area throughout the duration of the event. The object appeared to be cigar/blimp shaped craft tilted slightly downward.  It produced no trail as a jet should, nor did it have any lights, blinking or stationary.  If I had to guess, I would say that it was maybe a couple hundred feet above the ground, above of the farthest mountain visible from this position. It was only visible because of the sunlight reflecting off of it's surface.  If it has been any further away that this, it probably wouldn't have been visible from our position. As far as it's size, it was too far away to really be certain.  I would guess that it was not as large as a commercial plane, but not as small as the single-propeller planes commonly flown in this area. The sunlight reflecting from it's surface gave it a golden color.  It was lit so well that we could really see the shape quite well despite the distance.  So well, that we are certain that there were no wings present on this craft.  The object was about as bright as Polaris/North Star on clear night. It moved in straight line to the left. My brother noticed it first.  When he initially noticed it, the object was slightly to the right of the ""right"" radio tower.  It proceeded to move left, passing behind this tower and continuing to the left until it passed by the second tower.  After realizing that wasn't shaped like any known aircraft, my brother told me to look in that direction.  The object was so bright that it immediately caught my attention.  I viewed it for mere seconds before it passed behind the second ""left"" tower and proceeded to travel out of sight behind a wooded hill. I believe in extra terrestrial life and UFOs, but I had never saw anything to really solidify my beliefs.  This event really doesn't help because I can't rule out that it might have been a distant plane, despite weird shape and behavior.   When I saw it, I thought it might have been a jet, until I saw that it had no wings and did not leave a trail of any sort.  We were both in shock throughout the duration of the sighting, as it just looked so different and wrong compared to anything else we had seen in the sky. Right before I lost sight of it, I got out of the car and walked toward the trunk so I could see the object for a bit longer. Around 30 seconds or a minute later, the object reappeared going in the opposite direction.  It was slightly higher up this time.  It was still sort of cigar shaped but was now pointed in the direction it was traveling.  Within 5-10 seconds, the shape looked a bit different.  It looked almost as though it was two spheres in line, attached at the equator.  I'm not sure if this was a trick of light or if it actually changed shape.  It continued right for about 30 seconds.  At this point, the object appeared to become red or to glow red.  My brother and I both remarked on the odd color change. I observed it for another 30 seconds or so before I lost sight of it around a cloud.  I then ran to the front seat to retrieve my mother's cellphone to perhaps get a picture of the object, hoping that it would reveal itself on the other side of this cloud eventually.  I was unable to get any pictures/video of the object, as I had already put the camera away by the time I saw it the final time. Once I got back to my door of the car and looked back up, the object had disappeared.  I asked my brother where it had gone, when he explained what the object had done in my absence. He claims that he lost it in the cloud as well, but it appeared again shortly afterwards and proceeded to enter a sharp turn.  From this point onward, it was once again gold or yellow in color and its shape was different once again. As it made the turn, the object turned onto its side enough that he could note the shape.  It appeared to be disc shaped with a ring or separate segment in the bottom of it.  After making this turn, the object was traveling in the same direction as it was when we first discovered it.  It continued in this direction for 5-10 seconds. The last time I saw it was about a minute later.  The craft was heading downward and away from us.  The sun was setting quickly at this point and apparently the sun had sunk so low below the mountains that its light no longer reflected on the object's surface. I stood outside the car for several more minutes trying to catch another glimpse of it, but it was not seen again. I should note that about 8 minutes after the event, a small plane flew overhead and headed in the direction of the previous craft.  It was shocking seeing how different these two craft were.  Even as the plane became so far away that that it was barely visible, you could still see its wings and it was obviously no where near as reflective as the previous object.",2011-06-27T00:00:00,37.48708095238096,-82.49780952380952

As they passed over our house the lights moved even closer together and were in such synch with each other in movement.  For some reason the movement reminded me of a boomerang pattern.  (My husband doesn't agree about the boomerang thing so I guess its all in perception). I still cannot believe what we saw and it was most definitely not a plane, helicopter, balloon or shooting star.  Also, they made no noise which was odd being as low as they were.(Id say as low as youd normally see a helicopter) We called around and found no information which is odd being that the air control monitors so closely and this being so close to Charlotte Douglas Airport and being so low.

Sunday night, 6/26/11 about 10:00 p.m., outside of Willits in Northern California.  I skywatch every night and had just gone out, facing west, clear dark night, when a beautiful bright, sparkling object appeared towards the south, and silently moved at a height lower than our few commercial flyovers, quite slowly and steadily without variation in altitude, apparently heading north-northwest.  I of course assumed it was a plane—and from my angle it did seem to be a flat elliptical shape, but I knew the colors were wrong:  red at the rear, gold at the front, with the lights moving and interplaying into brilliant orange and a coppery gold at the center.  No separation between the lights and colors.  They weren’t flashing but instead moving and pulsing, really lovely. After only a few seconds of watching this, the lights all suddenly and uniformly dimmed and got hazy and changed character and it looked like a tiny version of a nebula cloud like I’ve seen in Hubble photos—but then I was distracted by a sudden narrow streak of dull white light that shot down, from some distance southward behind the “craft,” straight down to the ground (which I thought well, this could be a meteor, just without luminosity which isn’t uncommon).  Then the original “craft” immediately got bright again, back to red and orange and gold, and traveled only a short distance more when it just disappeared.  I waited and searched the sky to see if it reappeared but it didn’t. Then about 30 seconds later, another one appeared from almost the same point of origin, again out of nowhere, again silently and fairly slowly traveled the same flight path, but this one was all gold light and the light was more steady and the “craft” seemed a bit smaller.  When it got to the point where the first one had dimmed, it vanished.  All of this took between 1 – 2 minutes.  Nothing more occurred. I had not myself heard of any UFO sightings with orange as a key color but I’ve now googled and see there are some, including multiple sightings in Washington in 2009.",2011-06-27T00:00:00,39.49293333333334,-123.36550476190476

I  live in Cranberry Township, PA and it is a hilly area of Western PA.  My first thought was that it was a hot air balloon on fire.  As I looked it was followed by another.   I called my husband and we both grabbed cameras.   By the time the event was over, we observed about 10 of these orange fire balls go over.  They were headed in a straight line, flying ENE from Pittsburgh. We strung a few of our videos together and put two videos on YouTube.  One is labeled “Missiles over Pittsburgh 06/02/2012” is probably the best one.   The other “Cranberrytwpufo.qt”   A search in YouTube should bring them up quickly.  The Missile one has views from both my camera (I tried to do close-ups) and my husband’s cell phone video where he captured the things passing near the moon so you can get some perspective. They were going fast, and we heard no sounds from them, although a helicopter did fly by while we were out filming.  I really think it was a jet squadron being moved, but maybe someone can look at the pictures and see if that makes sense.  We’ve all seen planes fly at night, but I’ve never seen 10 or so round glowing fireballs go over.   I suppose it is possible that up until now I’ve never seen a group of military jets fly across the night sky at high altitude on a mostly clear night. I have read a written description from someone driving in Kentucky at the exact same time that most closely describes what we saw.   In fact, numerous google searches for the evening of 06/02/2012 “ufos” turned up about 4 sightings that I would consider identical to ours.  They ranged from Illinois to New York, all occurring at the exact time (the one in Illinois is listed at 9:15p.m. CST). Just thought I’d share.

It basically moves but stays in the same general area, right where the star Sirius is supposed to be.  We pointed it out to a visitor arriving and he noticed movement as well. Just so bizzare, what is this please te! ll me? It has been eight nights in a row now. The most recent sighting was yesterday at 11:58PM we were looking at it to no avail when we finally see it emerge from behind the nearest hills visible from my balcony.  It moves slowly and to the right (we always see it when we are facing E/NE).  If u draw a line down towards the horizon starting from orions belt, its right along that line.  This had been going on all week, but last night, we saw it again, and this time, we saw it emerge from behind the hills, this eliminates any possibility that this starlike bright object is a planet or star.  I would go so far as to say that this object is in the Earth's atmosphere.  When we saw it last night, and recorded video, ended up moving from just above the mountain range far upwards and to the right, unlike any of the six previous (of seven) nights I stayed awake to spot it.  I suspect since it didn't stay in the same general area as it usually did, that it is leaving, and I will no! t see it again tonight.  I will try to keep everyone updated. ! We were suspicious at first, thinking this was the star Capella, or more likely the star Sirius, b/c it is in that same position every night, but seeing it come UP from BEHIND the hillside shows that it is not a star nor a planet/asteroid, anything from space.  It is within the Earth's atmosphere.  I have posted the recordings we have made on my youtube channel billdaburgereater, these are the links to the second and most recent sighting videos.  Though I cannot say for sure what it is, having seen it emerge from behind the hills, I can conclusively say what it is not.

Je crois d'abord voir un oiseau de type corneille, mais comme le mouvement n est pas celui d un oiseau je m arrête dessus. Après quelques courts instants où j'essaye de l'indentifier à quelque chose de ""possible"" un sac plastique, un tissu, des ballons... je reste perplexe à le regarder, surtout qu'il me rappelle une video que j'ai vu il y a environ 2 ans sur internet dans laquelle on voyais un truc semblable mais blanc ou clair, pas loin d'un nuage, avec le meme genre de mouvement (je n ai pas réussi à la retrouver), et qui m avait retenu parceque je trouvait ça étrange et beau. Etant assez stupéfait je demande confirmation à un homme derrière moi. Je lui demande si il sait ce que c'est, il me dit ""non, des ballons? -regarde mieux, sérieusement, on dirait des ballons ça? - non c'est vrai... Je sais pas ce que c'est..."" et on est resté 10 minute à regarder sans trouver d explication, j ai essayé de filmer avec mon portable mais la qualité est trop mauvaise et il n arrivait pas à faire le point. Au bout d un moment il appelle une amie qui vient regarder aussi. A trois on regarde et je perçoit, tout en me disant ""la c'est trop fort"" de la lumière au dessous de l'ovni. Plus présisément l ovni était éclairé par en dessous par petites intermittences, comme des légers flashs blanc-jaune et orange-rouge, mais faibles, pâle (surtout qu il ne faisait pas encore sombre) et dans mon souvenir je n'ai pas vu directement de lumière, mais l'objet qui était éclairé par en dessous. Ca ma parut être quelque chose d'électrique en tous cas. Je demand! e, sans y revenir, au 2 si il ont vu la lumière, il me confirment. L'ovni s'éloignant petit a petit et allant vers l'est, on se quitte (eux retourne à leur taf) en plaisantant a demi ""on a vu un ovni!"", la fille ajoute en plaisantant ""c 'est des extra-terrestres, c'est les incas, on va tous mourir""...et moi je reprend mon velo et continu de le suivre jusqu à ce qu il disparaissent petit à petit. Le tout aura duré dans les 25 min selon mon ressenti. (10-15 avec les autres) 10-15min a le regarder s éloigner progressivement jusqu a disparaître.  Pour revenir sur la description de l objet : il semblait être, de loin (pour le décrire en se ratachant à qlq chose que l'ont connais), une sorte de tissu noir, déchiré, en lambeaux, et flottant, comme en apesanteur, en évolution continuelle. Je m'explique: il bougeait lentement comme en apesanteur et donc semblait se transformer, des fois il disparaissait presque, d'autre fois il semblait se déployer. J ai eu l impression que c'était dû a un effet de perspective… J ai eu l impression qu il y avait 3 parties, mais pas vraiment distinctes. Comme 3 ""morceaux de tissus"" plus ou moins rectangulaires et vertical, connectés, effilochés ou en lambeaux (donc non vraiment rectangulaire). Les lambeaux étaient vaguement pointus, en longueur (difficile d expliquer avec des mots). surtout, j avais l'impression que c'était flou tout en étant précis. C'est à dire, que 1. c'était assez loin pour que je ne puisse pas identifier ce que c'était ni la matière (si je tend ma main devant mes yeux, je crois que l 'objet n'était pas plus gros qu'un ongle) En même temps j'avais l impression de le voir clairement, j'ai une bonne vue, le ciel était sans nuage, il faisait encore bien jour... Une vision un peu contradictoire donc, mais qui a renforcé mon intérêt pour ce que je regardais. J avais vraiment la sensation de n'avoir jamais rien vu de tel, ça ne correspondait a rien de ce que je connaisse. J'aimerai bien trouver une video de ce truc ou un témoignage semblable... forme un peu médusale concernant les lambeaux.

On the night of October 20th, 2012, I was driving southbound on Route 10 just north of Delhi, New York. In the car with me was a long time friend.  We are both currently residents in the town of Delhi. The sky was mostly clear. At approximately 7:15 to 7:30 PM (last moments of twilight) we noticed a series of orange lights slowly flying toward us in an ascending manner.  These lights were not blinking, but steady in nature. Three of these lights were in the formation of a triangle.  The three lights together did not appear to be the edges of any solid object as the sky between them was visible. The three in formation were the first in a series.  Behind them, was a steady stream of other orange lights following in more or less a straight line.  These straight-line lights were arising from behind the mountains in the distance. The mountains in the distance were probably about ten miles or so away.  In gauging the size of the lights, if I were to hold a dime at arms length, I would imagine they would have been difficult to see.  If I was holding a small dried chickpea, they may have illuminated the edges. Because of the odd nature of these lights, we pulled the car over to the southbound shoulder just past Hoag Crossroad.  I know this was the exact location because when I got out to take photos, this is where my iPhone ‘geotagged’ the photos. From this location, we had the view of an open valley ahead of us at approximately eleven o’clock in relation to Route Ten.  This is where the lights could be seen coming toward us and from the mountains in the distance. When we got out of the car, I shut my lights in the hopes that it would not interfere with my intention of taking photos. As we watched and took photos, the three lights in triangular formation came to a stationary position for about twenty seconds.  They were still in the distance by a few miles and at least 45 degrees or more from the horizon. I then noticed that the lights in triangle formation begin to fade.  I could not ascertain whether they going away in the opposite direction or just fading.  Regardless, they disappeared. The same began to happen with the straight-line lights.  One by one they just disappeared in generally the same location as the triangular ones had. It was right around the time that the triangular lights were holding and fading when a woman driving a car also pulled over to see what was going on.  She then got out of her car to look as well. As we talked and watched the lights fading, I somehow noticed another object approaching us along Route 10.  It was coming from the same direction as the orange lights had been traveling. This object was not illuminated, but instead, barely visible because it was black and flying very low just above the tree-tops lining the road on our side. I shouted about it and pointed.  My friend and the woman also confirmed it.  Since the object was black against a nearly black sky it wasn’t easy to see. Prior to getting closer to us, it was more like an ink blob. But the closer it got, the more revealing the shape. If I had to give it a shape it was something like an inverted spade. Whatever it was, it was silent and steadily gliding. It’s speed wasn’t too fast.  I would judge it as 45 to 60 miles per hour. It’s size was somewhat difficult to judge, but in relation to the size of the trees and it’s low flying nature above the trees, I would estimate it at approximately three medium car widths across at the widest point- therefore, about 25 feet across. As it glided over our heads, I attempted to take a photo despite the near darkness.  To my surprise, the camera registered something because the focus indicator (a square box) zoomed in prior to releasing the shutter. After snapping the photo, the object seemed to descend into the trees just off to the side of us.  However, I am not sure if it descended or just kept flying out of site and away from us.  Both my friend and the woman quickly used their flashlight applications in their phones in an attempt to illuminate the wooded area off to our side, but nothing could be seen. Either way, at that point, it was no longer visible. We then turned our attention back to the valley area where the orange lights were seen and saw the last of the lights fading.  The actual number of orange lights was not counted but I would say, before the black object diverted our sights, there were approximately eight to ten in total. After the orange lights had faded, we talked about what we saw, and the woman’s daughter drove up to us because they had been communicating on the phone while some of this was happening.  Apparently, they didn’t live too far from this location. Shortly thereafter, we then noticed what were obviously a few military fighter planes now in the area where the orange lights had just been moments earlier.  I’m confident these were military fighter planes due to their main characteristics- fast nature and quick blinking lights. I distinctly remember those being the only kind of planes in the sky in the aftermath of 9-11.  Therefore, I’m quite familiar with them and know them as very different from commercial planes. At that point, the woman gave me her email and we drove home. As of this writing, I have so far looked at the photos, including one video I shot and unfortunately, not much registered.  However, in playing with some settings, I have been able to pull something out of the one photo of the black object.  It is not too clear and seems to have much pixilation due to the low light level, but there is something distinctly outlined. If I can flesh anything else out of the photos, I will send forward them.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,42.3179,-74.9308

An unidentified flying object (UFO) was spotted hovering near Williamson on Tuesday afternoon and there were several witnesses who watched it. The Williamson Daily News got several calls about the UFO which appeared southeast of downtown. The autumn sky was a clear, bright blue with sunshine. The first call came in from a railroad employee. He and several others saw it as they got off work around 3:00 p.m. Another call came in from a resident of West Williamson. Constructions workers at Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College in the West End of town also sighted the object. Another woman from the South Williamson area also said she spotted the UFO. A resident of the Valley View subdivision, which is south of Williamson, viewed the object through binoculars. She said the UFO appeared to be oblong and seemed to run vertical, rather than horizontally. Employees of the Williamson Daily News and City Tire, which is right across the street from their offices, saw the object hovering for well over an hour. Customers of the automotive repair business also saw the UFO. Heads were turned skyward toward the object. At times it appeared to get brighter. Several jets appeared to fly in the vicinity of the UFO.  Contrails could be seen zigzagging all around the object.  This made for much speculation by those who witnessed the strange, airborne object. Reports from Pike County also said the UFO was spotted near Elkhorn City and Pikeville, Ky. Facebook was alive with people commenting on the pictures that were uploaded.  It made for an interesting afternoon in and around Williamson.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,37.7159,-82.2369

On the night in question, my girlfriend and I were driving north on Zucksville Road, in Forks Township, Easton, PA.  Around 8 oclock or so, I noticed a reddish orange light in the sky off to my right (southeast) through the trees.  At first, I thought it was the lights from the radio antenna that is located on the top of the mountain, but then I saw the actual radio antenna and realized that that was not what I was seeing.  The first light passed over the car in the sky as we drove, moving southeast to northwest. As I said, it was reddish orange in color, and lacked the flickering nature of airplane lights but instead looked almost like a fireball, with a densely colored center and a lighter halo or corona. It would occasionally 'pulse', growing slightly dimmer and then growing brighter again, and eventually we lost sight of it because, while driving, it was unsafe to try and keep it in sight. We were on our way to pick up a pizza at a restaurant a mile or so n! orth of where we first saw the light, and when we pulled into the parking lot, we noticed there were two more lights moving from the southwest to the northeast. Just like the first one we saw, these two lights were orange in color with a weird pulsing effect. There was no noise, no erratic movement, just a leisurely uniform pace. At one point, they moved in almost parallel lines with one another. As those two moved over the horizon, we noticed again, from the same point of origin, another light. It followed the same track as the first two. We drove down to another parking lot to get a better point of view, and witnessed two more objects following the same course: as one would approach the horizon to the southeast, one would appear to the northwest. All of the objects were of the same color and brightness, with the same pulsing effect. Again, for clarity's sake, there was no flickering or flashing or strobing that is associated with airplane lights, just a slow occasional pu! lse. At one point, an airplane did cross paths with one, and t! he diffe rence between the lights of an airplane and the objects was apparent. To be fair, there is a small local airport nearby, but none of the objects were going anywhere near the airport and they did not resemble the lights of an airplane. I took several short videos with my phone, but unfortunately the quality does little justice to the incident.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,40.68146598360656,-75.2432762295082

It was estimated that there were about 20 visible dots at different times.  Some  of the dots ascending for about 2-3 seconds before disappearing completely.  The others intermittently disappeared and then re-appeared before disappearing altogether after observing them for about 2-4 minutes. The amazing thing is we searched just like we did last week to see if anyone else had reported seeing any sightings.

This light did not appear to move.  We walked into the backyard to get a better view, to see if a spotlight was causing it, but we couldn't find anything.  At that point the lights seemed to be slowly spreading apart and you could tell there were at least 9 separate lights to make up this shape.  The two of us kept watching for a little while longer and decided to run inside to get our three next door neighbors to make sure we weren't crazy.  After only a few minutes of our neighbors joining us a plane started flying toward the cloudy looking lights.  The plane passed underneath the formation and the lights separated into different directions, kind of changing the shape and getting dimmer.   Two out our three neighbors agreed the lights were strange.  Our age ranges are from 26-50.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,44.6307,-93.30340000000001

I was texting a friend of mine and had my cell phone in hand, sitting on a cushioned bench on my porch.  I was facing approximately 162° SE at around 10:50 PM, deep into the text message I was sending on my phone. Once I sent the text. I looked up and was about to retrieve my laptop, when something bright caught my in the corner of my eye.  I then turned my head slightly to the right, to see a large bright orange colored fireball in the sky.  It looked like a star, only several times brighter and very close. Its exact location from where I was sitting is 200°S. At first I thought it was a street light that I had not noticed before.  I just moved into these apartments yesterday. (Cedar Groove in Shepherdsville KY)   As I watched it I thought “Maybe it is a plane. I am close to the airport. It has to be a plane.”  I watched it hover, unmoving, unwavering, shimmering like a large bright star / fireball. I thought it would at least move and so I could see the lights of an airplane.  It’s often common to see a light, and then realize it’s a plane simply preparing for landing as they turn. Well, it did not do anything.  I sat there watching it hover for at least 30 seconds until it started to quickly fade. It was almost like it was a burnt out ball of fire.  The last thing I could see of it was a tiny red/orange dot, and then it was gone. I heard no noises.  In fact, there were no airplanes for a while until afterwards the airport seemed to make the path go through the exact same area where I saw the UFO, and back towards me heading west.  That was not until around 11:20 when I started to see airplanes in the skies from the nearby center of UPS. The oddest part about this is I have not seen a UFO for years.  I lived in Reno Nevada ans used to see flying UFO’s quite a bit. Most of those objects moved in strange patterns, and I saw most of them during the day.  I have NEVER seen anything like this in all of my 31 years.  I will be simply amazed if I was the only person to have seen this sighting. There was no denying how big and bright it was.

I am a VERY big skeptic when it comes to this type of thing. But what I saw last night cannot be explained. My friend and I had just picked my brother up from a driver education course at 9:00 pm.  We stopped at a Taco Bueno to get some food on our way home.   As we were driving East on highway 20, we were about four minutes from where it goes from four lanes to two lanes, when I saw two bluish spotlights shining down on the oncoming lanes of traffic. About the same time I saw this, the spotlights rose into a horizontal position, shining on my car when they did.  As the spotlights raised up I saw the underbelly of what seemed to be a trapezoidal middle with two right triangle shaped wings that held the big blue/white spotlights. The wings seemed more like anchors for the spotlights than actual wings.  They were not long and slender like and airplane, but were fat, short, and stocky with the spotlight on the ends.  The underbelly had four or six sets of rectangular greenish yellow panels on the front end and back end.  These panels seemed almost like you could see into the aircraft through them, like they were a type of viewing panels.  I saw these things so very clearly because this aircraft was only about the height of a two or three story building.  This aircraft was also not in flight, it was merely hovering, but it did kind of sway as the spotlights rose. My friend was in the passenger seat and saw the exact same thing I did.  My little brother was in the back seat and from his position he couldn’t really see it.  My friend reminded me to pay attention to driving as the aircraft seemed to be preparing to fly forward.  As we drove past it I could no longer see the craft and told my brother to try to get a look.  My brother caught a glimpse of the bluish lights, but he did not see any detail. This aircraft made absolutely no noise.  We did not have the raidio on at all in the car and as soon as we saw it we didn’t say anything but hushed “are you seeing this?” and my brother’s quieted questions of what we were looking at.  If this thing had made a noise, like any craft that close to us would, we would have heard it. Upon returning home I described this sighting to my mother, she sat down with us and we all explained in detail what happened. In the middle of my description, my mother gasped and covered her mouth. She quickly told me that as she was peeking out of the blinds, hoping to see our headlights (she was worried because us stopping to get food took longer than she expected), she saw something she had shrugged off as probably her imagination at the time. She saw a bluish spotlight shining up and then down our driveway and disappear. She didn’t see any cars before or after this light and she swore it was not any kind of headlight reflection or anything, it was like a light being shown from the sky. I called my boyfriend who is an Intel analyst for the military and he assured me there is no aircraft in our military that is like the one I described. I welcome anyone who thinks they have a reasonable explanation, but so far I have found none.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,36.2643,-95.8277

It was at dusk, the sun had set below the horizon for only a minute or two. The sky and clouds were still somewhat illuminated. To the west, near where the sun had just set, I witnessed a stationary, hovering, illuminated, white oval shape. It appeared as if the entire shape was illuminated evenly. From my observation, it did not appear to be reflecting sunlight, because the sun had already set, and the object appeared to be in Earth's shadow. At the time, the object was the brightest thing in the sky. Although the moon was not visible for comparison, I would estimate the object to be about 1/3 of the full moon's size. The object appeared as a white oval. It may have been a lenticular shape seen on edge (like a white Mentos candy), but I could discern no 3D shape to it. It did have a clean edge. The object was also perfectly symmetrical, with no bumps or irregularities in the shape. I observed it for approximately 15-20 seconds, all the while using my powers of logic and reasoning to determine what I was looking at, but was unable to do so. As I watched, the object began to disappear. It did not shrink in size, recede, blur, or blink out. Instead, it appeared to become gradually more and more transparent (evenly, while retaining its clean edge) until it was no longer visible. Though I am not trained in aerial observation, I am reasonably intelligent. In my opinion, what I witnessed was not any sort of cloud, celestial body, or other natural phenomena. Nor was it any type of man-made aircraft that I am aware of. Other, more subjective notes:  I was outside shooting a firearm at the time of the sighting. I was shooting at a target to the north.  A thought entered my head, something along the lines of, ""What if you saw a UFO right now?"", then I looked to my left, and there one was. I feel as though I was somehow compelled to look in the direction of the object, and perhaps it had something to do with the fact that I was firing a gun.  This is purely speculative. Later I thought about the fact that I was in the town of Ovalo, Texas.  Ovalo means oval in Spanish.  What I saw would definitely be described as an oval.  Not sure what the connection is there, if any. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2012-08-05T00:00:00,32.1726,-99.8256

Obviously I would have a long time ago if I had planned to do so. I was watching the National Geographic Channel last night (history of UFO's) and something said there really struck me.  A female witness to the 8 o'clock sighting of the large ""V"" shaped craft in the Phoenix area (I believe it was one of the first sightings of the Phoenix lights) said that the underside looked like compartments, similar to stores at a mall. In late August, 1999 my wife and I witnessed a huge craft in the night sky above Cayey, Puerto Rico. I was a Chief Cryptologic Technician attached to Naval Security Group Activity, Sabana Seca, Puerto Rico from August 1997 to July 2000. We lived in Cayey for the entire period. We had attended a party at the Chiefs' Club on the base and arrived home at approximately 2am.  My wife had driven home and had not been drinking.  I had a few, and didn't want to drive the 30+ miles. We parked in the driveway and my wife was first out of the truck.  On the sidewalk she stopped in her tracks, as I caught up with her, she said ""please tell me you're seeing this"". When I looked up, I saw a huge craft in the sky to the west, directly over the city. The craft was at least a mile across.  It was at a very low altitude, 100-150 feet above ground and was well lit by all the city lights. When I first saw it, it was at a range about a mile or so. It slowly drifted toward us, heading east.  As it approached Highway 52 (4 lane Autopista), it slowed and came to a complete stop.  Then it rotated from an easterly heading to a north-northeast heading. I could then tell that it was shaped like a huge ""V"" and not a straight line.   As it rotated, the ""wing tip"" passed directly over one of the highway lights.  The lights are 40-50 feet tall, and the highway is no more than 50 yards from where we were standing.  Our vantage point was about 30 feet higher than the road surface, at the base of a large hill, on the east side of the highway. As the tip of the right wing passed over the highway light and stopped, I could see detail on the underside. It was a dark grey color, nearly black.  I was taken by how ""boxy"" it looked, not aerodynamic at all.  There were several compartments and metal reinforcement structures that I could clearly see.  There were no windows and no lights that I saw.  The wing appeared to be 15-20 feet thick from top to bottom and massive in size. I've been around many aircraft in the military (C-5's, C-17's etc.).  Before the Navy, I worked for an in-flight catering company at Anchorage International Airport (Anchorage, AK) and have been in, around and under everything from a 747 to a DC-8.  Nothing I've seen before even comes close to the size of this object. After rotating, it stayed motionless, but only for a few seconds.  It then started moving forward, slowly at first, then accelerated very rapidly and vanished into the darkness. The entire sighting lasted 12-15 seconds.  The craft made absolutely no noise. We were frozen there, motionless and speechless.  We couldn't have gotten to a camera, even if one of us had thought about it. We stayed awake the rest of the night, talking about what we had seen.  Predictably, my wife saw some things that I didn't (lights), and I saw some things that she didn't.  I know that I became fixated with the underside of the wing above the highway light, and didn't look at the rest of the craft again until it started moving away from us.

Source:  Scientific American, December 18, 1886, Letters to the Editor. ((BEGIN QUOTED TEXT OF LETTER TO THE EDITOR))   To the Editor of the Scientific American:   ""Curious Phenomenon in Venezuela""   The following brief account of a recent strange meteorological occurrence may be of interest to your readers as an addition to the list of electrical eccentricities:  During the night of the 24th of October last, which was rainy and tempestuous, a family of nine persons, sleeping in a hut a few leagues from Maracaibo, were awakened by a loud humming noise and a vivid, dazzling light, which brilliantly illuminated the interior of the house. The occupants, completely terror stricken, and believing, as they relate, that the end of the world had come, threw themselves on their knees and commenced to pray, but their devotions were almost immediately interrupted by violent vomitings, and extensive swellings commenced to appear in the upper part of their bodies, this being particularly noticeable about the face and lips. It is to be noted that the brilliant light was not accompanied by a sensation f heat, although there was a smoky appearance and a peculiar smell. The next morning, the swellings had subsided, leaving upon the face and body, large black blotches.  No special pain was felt until the ninth day, when the skin peeled off, and these blotches were transformed into virulent raw sores. The hair of the head fell off upon the side which happened to be underneath when the phenomenon occurred, the same side of the body being, in all nine cases, the more seriously injured. The remarkable part of the occurrence is that the house was uninjured, all doors and windows being closed at the time. No trace of lightning could afterward be observed in any part of the building, and all the sufferers unite in saying that there was no detonation, but only the loud humming already mentioned. Another curious attendant circumstance is that the trees around the house showed no signs of injury until the ninth day, when they suddenly withered, almost simultaneously with the development of the sores upon the bodies of the occupants of the house. This is perhaps a mere coincidence, but it is remarkable that the same susceptibility to electrical effects, with the same lapse of time, should be observed in both animal and vegetable organisms. I have visited the sufferers, who are now in one of the hospitals of this city; and although their appearance is truly horrible, yet it is hoped that in no case will the injuries prove fatal.

In 1966 I was 8 years old.  At sleep away summer camp {Surprise Lake near Cold Springs NY on the old Cornwallis estate}. I had a strange night.  After the day's activities we returned to our bunk on a forested hillside. There was a light shinning through the window that normally was not there.  My four bunk mates and I did not really think anything of it because it actually illuminated the whole cabin which was normally dark and kind of scary. It was in the woods below a place on the hill side called ""Bald Spot"" a patch of granite where no trees grew. We figured a counselor must have set up a flood light out side. We all fell asleep. That night I dreamed two figures were standing over me looking down at me. On the left was a typical ""Grey"" with almond shaped eye shades and on the right, a round headed, round faced and round eyed looking dude with a mouth stuck in the position like he was saying ""oooo."" The ""Roundy Round"" had on like a sombrero that made him look Mexican. The ""Grey"" had on a silver space suit. The ""Grey"" had a long probe/rod with a round glowing orb at the end of it that he inserted into my forehead all the way to the back of my skull. They then looked at each other. The ""Grey"" pulled the probe back out of my forehead and showed the still attached glowing orb to the ""Roundy Round"" They both looked at each other bewildered, like ""I guess we got him already!"" and moved across the cabin to my sleeping bunk mates, visiting each one. The ""Grey"" inserted the rod into their forehead, and when he extracted it the orb that had been on the end of the rod stayed in their heads!  Next the ""Grey"" and the ""Roundy Round"" waited at the doorway as all my bunkmates arose like they were sleep walking, and followed them out of the cabin into an intense white light. I pulled the covers over my head. I figured this is just a neat dream and fell back asleep. For some reason I was not afraid. We all awoke the next day as if nothing had happened. The Very next evening the counselors created an unusual activity for us. They blindfolded our whole encampment{20 kids}. They marched us through the early evening to a geodesic dome structure that was an indoor basketball court. This they artfully transformed into an alien space craft using aluminium foil, crepe paper streamers, strobe lights and the creepiest rock music they could muster on a portable phonograph. We sat along the inside perimeter of the dome and the counselors who were made up and dressed up as ""Aliens"" proceeded to abduct us. I was in on this as one of three volunteers that helped the counselors decorate the geodesic dome ""Spacecraft"" in preparation for the activity. I had been sworn to secrecy!  Now after about a half an hour of this event the counselors had to call it off, as most of my bunk-mates where being frightened to tears by what was going on. Some of them actually screaming for their mothers in terror! The counselors could not even console them by showing them it was all a hoax, and quickly had to evacuate the dome to get the children to the safety of the mess hall!  In retrospect I realize now that the whole encampment-19 kids and 5 teen-aged counselors were actually abducted the night the light shined through the window. The next night the light was gone!  The night in question I was left in bed because ""I was already implanted or they could not implant me for some reason"" The very next day the counselors subconsciously reenacted the whole event. At that time I actually felt left out, because they left me behind. In retrospect I was the lucky one.",,,

I was at Memorial Park in Houston TX in the evening during autumn 1973, along with my husband, and a group of men and their wives.  The men were playing tag football.  I was sitting in a lawn chair facing due south.  The game had not started and the men were warming up for the game, when I saw what I thought was an airplane flying from east to west in the night sky.  As my eyes tracked it, it suddenly came to a standstill.  I mentioned this to the lady sitting next to me.  She said she had binoculars in her car. She retrieved them, and handed them to me.  When I looked at the object through the binoculars, and discovered it was not just one light, but a string of lights in a horizontal position.  I did not attempt to count the number of them.  As I  and others watched, the object appeared to began turning on its side gradually.  It changed, bit by bit, from a straight string of lights to an oval, and then ultimately to an full circle of lights.  Other people became interested and also watched this phenomenom.  It turned back into a horizontal string of lights, and then moved vertically.  I could see what appeared to be after-flares coming from each light.  The object remained there for approximately 45 minutes moving this way and that, and then suddenly ascended within a matter of a few seconds upward and to the west.  I have prepared a rudimentary illustration with Adobe Photoshop to show how this object revolved, and yet remained in a stationary position over Houston.  I made no report of this at that time.  There was a lot of debunking going on regarding UFOs and I did not care to get involved.  I know what we saw.  Only in the past year did I send a pencil sketch to MUFON.  I received no reply from them.  It has been many years since I watched this UFO in the night sky, but it still stands out clearly as if I had just seen it moments ago.

Ninth Avenue UFO Incident New York City Summer 1974 The Complete Story    I am an accomplished artist (painter) and actor (theatre and film) who has worked with Rod Steiger, Burt Reynolds, Peter Boyle, John Turturro and Dennis Farina among many others.  This is the story behind a UFO event that occurred in New York City during the summer of 1974.  It was totally blacked-out on the TV news and not reported (to the best of my knowledge) in the press at the time.  This event may well be one of the biggest cover-ups in the history of UFO sightings.  This was not just some distant light in the sky, but an actual bi-convex craft, with an insignia on it, that came down and slowly (about 45 miles per hour), with multi-colored lights blinking in what appeared to be programmed sequences, literally cruised up the canyons of Manhattan in daylight for all to see.  I was working at the time for Joe Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theatre.  I was helping to build and decorate sets for various productions.  We were doing ""Pericles"" and ""Merry Wives of Windsor"" up in Central Park at the Delacorte Theatre there.  I believe it was toward the end of June or the beginning of July.  I wrote the exact dates down at the time, but I have been unable to find the paper with them on as this happened many years ago and I assume it has been lost or thrown out by accident.  I was asked to take a load of costumes downtown that needed last minute alterations.  We loaded them into the Festival van and I drove out of the park and headed down Columbus Avenue which turns into Ninth Avenue farther down.  As I headed downtown at about 6:30 pm, I noticed what appeared to be very bright lights of some sort, way downtown, perhaps in the 20s or 30s.  I thought it might be a large neon sign or something for a store opening or maybe a movie premiere of some sort.  As I got to the 60s near Lincoln Center I could tell that the lights were moving and coming closer up the avenue.  As it got closer and closer, I couldn't believe what I was then able to see.  It was a craft of some kind, very high tech-looking, heading directly for me.  It was just above the tops of five-story buildings on the avenue and it spanned the width of the entire street  It was circular in shape, but tilted up slightly so it looked like an ellipse.  The convex bottom was glowing a bright, iridescent greenish-yellow, almost like neon, with a Saturn-like rectangular shaped circular band, around the circumference of the craft, of bright green, which had small multi-colored lights (red, yellow, blue, etc.) set in it.  The band protruded from the craft all the way around.  The lights were blinking in what appeared to be programmed sequences.  There were two large, very bright, red, beacon-like lights (one on each side of the craft), oval in shape (horizontally), which extended from the green circular band.  They were flashing on and off somewhat slowly, almost like a pulse.  I kept saying to myself, ""What the hell is that?!!""  I just could not believe what I was actually seeing.  I don't remember feeling any fear, though, because it looked so beautiful and non-threatening.  And the blinking lights were moving in such pleasing patterns that they made me feel happy (perhaps that was their intended effect).  I had the distinct feeling that they (whoever ""they"" were) were having some fun and just saying, ""Hi!""  There was an insignia on the bottom of the craft, on the curved part toward the front, not the exact middle of the bottom, which appeared to be recessed in the yellow made of thick black lines.  I believe it was composed of three symbols, almost like a logo.  I had never seen anything like them before.  They looked like a foreign alphabet or symbol system of some kind as the craft passed directly over me as I drove beneath it, nearing the Lincoln Tunnel, in the 50s.  Many other people saw it.  I could see people standing on the sidewalks looking and staring up at it.  The sky was still light at that hour, so I could see it wasn't being held up by a helicopter or something like that.  This was certainly not a blimp or a balloon of some kind.  It looked solid and real.  It was still rush-hour and there was a lot of traffic trying to get out of the city through the tunnel, so I couldn't stop, and I also had only about an hour to get the costumes taken care of and get back up to the theatre in time for the opening.  I didn't think they would take it well if the show was late going up and the reason I gave was that I had seen a UFO on Ninth Avenue!  I figured that this incident would be all-over the news when I got home.  Later that evening, I rushed home thinking that this was big news and that they would probably even be pre-empting the regular shows to cover it.  When I got home I flipped on the TV and channel surfed around the dial, but there was nothing out of the ordinary.  I remember thinking that was very strange and decided to wait for the 11:00 o'clock news.  Again, at 11:00, there was only the usual local news, weather and sports.  Nothing about the UFO, not even a denial, anywhere.  I thought maybe they were trying to figure out how to deal with it and were delaying coverage.  So, I went to bed thinking I'll check the newspapers early in the morning because this has got to be front page headline stuff.  When I awoke, I went down to the corner newsstand and checked the first few pages of several main newspapers -- there was nothing at all about it.  Unless there was a small blurb in the back pages, but I doubt it. This started to instill some fear and paranoia in me, because I then realized that the government could totally censor and block or kill a story.  And I always had believed we had a free press -- but after this I certainly didn't believe that anymore.  A few days later I was eating lunch near the prop department down at the Public Theatre when a gal I knew who worked in the department came in.  She had almost straight, longish, light-blond, slightly reddish hair and freckles, and looked somewhat ethereal -- a very pretty gal.  I said to her, ""You're not going to believe what I saw fly up Ninth Avenue the other evening.""  Her face went ashen and she blurted, ""I know what you're talking about, I saw it, too!""  She said she had been shopping for props for ""Wives"" and had just come out of a store on West 57th Street between Eighth and Ninth, and that she and a couple of hundred other people saw it go by as it headed up the avenue.  We discussed it a bit, and she said she had seen exactly the same craft as I had seen.  I asked her if there was anything in the newspapers about it, but she said, no, she didn't see anything.  And then she started to get a bit freaked-out and said, ""I can't talk a! bout this anymore.  I don't want to talk about it.  I won't talk about it.  I don't want to continue this discussion.""  She then abruptly rushed out of the room in a somewhat agitated state.  Probably because the reality of it, and what it implied, had just really sunk in. I can't remember her name now, but I think it was Jane something -- but I can't say for sure.  I intend, at some point, to check with the Festival for a list of people that worked in props that summer and see if I can locate her.  I now believe beyond any doubt whatsoever that UFOs are real.  I know that they're here, because I've seen them up-close -- and I know what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I have been looking around off and on to see if anyone else did too. I am glad to have found this site. Be that as i may… Here it is.  My family vacationed at Hampton Beach N.H. pretty much every year during 4th of July week to watch/partake in the city funded fireworks display. This year was kind of special to me because ""The Commodores"" were playing at the boardwalk that year. As luck would have it, I had the opportunity to watch them perform some of their tunes despite the fact that the venue was a 21 plus, ticket in hand establishment. I sneaked in and watched until they kicked me out. On the night that I saw this object…. I remember it was a few days before the fourth at around 8 pm to 9 pm. A typical thing we would do after dinner and boardwalk arcade fun is walked the long stretch of beach. With shoes in hand walking a southerly direction on the cold wet sand,  the object in question seemed to kind of appear just a few hundred feet out and a few hundred feet over the ocean. As it moved in the same direction as us its velocity was maybe three or four times the pace we kept. It seemed to effortlessly float along past us. It was disc shaped and very dark on the bottom like it was devoid or less than there if that makes any sense. It had lights that were rotating around it in a clockwise direction at a pace that seemed to match its forward velocity. Well not like a bunch of lights. More like one wide light that can only be described like a windshield wiper that leaves a dissipating light trail behind it as it moves forward. I was confused by this point. I! clearly remember questioning what I was seeing and my older siblings dismissing it as a balloon or a helicopter or a blimp or a blah blah blah. I also clearly remember saying that it can't be any of that because there was no noise coming from it; Why cant we hear it? Where are the engines? even blimps have engines!! If there is one thing that makes me believe that I saw what I think I saw is the lack of noise it made. Even to this day I get freaked out thinking about how it made absolutely no noise.

It had what appeared to me to be windows, like an office building and they were all dimly lithe up with yellow lights.  There were many windows throughout the craft, and not all of the windows were lithe up.  Other than the lights that were in the windows, there were no other visibible lights throughout the craft.  The size of the windows appeared to me to be about 7 foot tall and 4 foot wide, with perfect corners. The craft was about 300 yards long (and not clear on how wide or deep it was).  It was quiet with no sound at all. It was very windy that night. The craft was slow moving and on an even keel.  It was traveling south bound. The first ! pass lasted about 3 minutes, and then disappeared, long enough for me to get back into my car.  Then it came back on a north bound track and again that lasted about 3 minutes.  It appeared to be a dark color and not shinny, like a grey almost black in color.

I knew it wasnt a plane because it was way to low.I looked up to see what kind of helicopter was coming,but what i seen was no helicopter.  It was about a hundred feet in the air moving very slowly.  I was right under it.  It was like an octagon shape with lights surronding it.  It must have been over a hundred feet wide.  I compared it to the building it was flying over.  It continued to move slow until it passed us across the street from the corner we were on.  It started to hover over a tree on the other corner across the street.

In the summer of 1993 me and two friends witnessed a diamond shaped UFO.  Matt was driving, Joe was in the front seat and I (Jason) was in the backseat of the Chevette.  Matt was taking me home so we had to drive through Rockford. It was evening and we weren’t on DST back then. It was about 9:30pm-10:30pm when this occurred. Basically I was in the middle of telling them about some orange glowing balls I had, at the time, saw for the last few weeks before when this occurred, which really was strange timing, but unrelated. We were rounding the curve just outside of Rockford when I noticed a bright light just over Madden Hill. I convinced Matt to stop the car just about 300-400 feet (maybe more) from the curve. We watched in awe as the light turned into two lights, and then three...and then we all got out of the car. It was amazing because it wasn’t like the lights I had seen previously. The lights slowly kept multiplying, at the time we didn’t realize it was the object moving toward us, and the shape of the object became apparent as a diamond. There was moon light that night and I remember other cars pulling over to watch too. The object didn’t make a sound. It had eight lights on it and the lights were staggered evenly. The tip of the object had a light and the rear tip did too.  The other lights were on the edges and seemed to be placed halfway between the center points of the diamond shape. The object was very black and contrasted against the deep glowing blue sky. It flew parallel with old highway 11 and continued on toward town. We all watched it until it couldn’t be seen anymore. At the time I couldn’t believe how close it seemed, but looking back it must have been really big because of how much of the sky it actually blocked out and how far we watched it travel. I would really like to connect with anybody else that stopped and watched it that evening. There were at least 6 other cars that pulled over and watched. I know there was a red and white truck that was about 100 foot from us pointing in the opposite direction that had stopped and the people got out and watched.

I am from the west side of the mountains, north of Seattle. I am a 52 year old male.  I attended Wenatchee Valley College and then attended Eastern Univ. in Cheney, WA.  My major was Audiology and that's my occupation currently.  It was 1992 when I started at Eastern and I put a year in when that horrible winter of 1992-1993 took place.  At that point I decided for a change due to the record breaking winter conditions, and since I always wanted to live in Hawaii after spending time there in the Navy, I sold my truck and RV and moved to Kauai.  I attended the two year school in Lihue working towards my degree and while there I befriended a gentleman who taught at the college.  As he learned of my living status he offered me to look after his aunt's house who was hospitalized with a stroke.  I ended up spending a year in Kauai and moved back to Spokane to finish up at Eastern.  But before I left the “Garden Island” the year I spent there was the most fascinating year of my lif! e.  And not solely because of what I'm about to share with you, but also just from the people and the Hawaiian way. It was October 17, 1993, about 2 months after I arrived to Kauai, which my friend the math teacher and I were returning to his aunt's house where I was staying.  I still remember the time; it was about 6:00 pm and a beautiful Sunday evening.  We were sitting in the driveway chatting before I was getting ready to go inside the house.  As I was talking to my friend the math teacher, who was to my left in his driver's seat, I noticed in the corner of my eye something strange.  As I turned my head to the right looking outside my passenger window I saw a light ball traveling fast above me through the clouds.  It looked artificial maybe 6 feet in diameter traveling very straight and whizzed right over us at a good clip. It looked to be about 500 to 600 feet up coming at us at about 2 o'clock. I only got a short glance at it this time, but I noticed it certainly was not a meteor because I could tell that it was artificial traveling at a rather at low altitude very straight.  There w! as no burning tail and it was close enough for me to get a very good look at it.  So then I turned to my math teacher friend and said “I just saw something very funny looking.”   So as we continued talking about, it then it appeared again about a minute later and having rolled my passenger window down this time I stuck my head out and saw it very clearly.  Again, it came at us at about 2 o'clock but this time I saw it turn a 45 degree turn then another 45 degree turn and took off at 10 o'clock right over the town of Lihue.  It was still daylight and even though it was simply a light ball traveling through the sky, it looked very very strange to see such a thing especially in broad daylight.  It made no noise and when it turned those 45 degree turns it didn't slow down at all and turned on a dime.  It looked like a big round lighted glass ball being remotely controlled at about 500 feet up.  Then we then got out of the car and my math teacher friend, who is a rather small sta! tured Japanese Hawaiian man, started joking and asking me if I! had bee n drinking.  He did not see this thing at all because he had a big bush along the driveway on his side of the car which blocked his view.  So at that point I went into the house and my math teacher friend took off for home. When I got into the house I realized what I just saw was not anything we have.  It had no wings, it was just a lighted glass ball traveling rather fast through the Hawaiian sky at about 500 feet up, and turned twice on a dime like something I’ve never seen before.  Again, when I saw it coming at us from 2 o'clock it then turned 45 degrees from 3 o’clock and then straight to 9 o’clock then turned another 45 degree turn and took off at 10 o'clock, and of course the times are a reference of direction.  So now I'm in the house thinking wow! What do I do now?  S o I called the local am radio station in Lihue which was only about 5 blocks from the house.  A Hawaiian lady answered and I asked her if she had received any UFO reports.  She asked me if I was into “astrology” joking a bit, and I said no but that I just saw something very strange.  I asked her if I could come down to the radio station and if she could come outside to meet me so if both of us saw it together she could repo! rt it as a witness.  So I took off on my motorcycle and the lady came out with eyes as big as saucers herself.  We then stood together looking up at the sky and at that point I felt rather silly and we saw nothing.  So after saying thank you very much, I took my motorcycle and went back to the house. At this time it had gotten dark and I parked my bike along-side the house on the lawn.  I got off the bike and looked up at the beautiful starry night Hawaiian sky and said these exact words, ""Well whatever it was I guess I'm not seeing it again.""   Then right at that point came the second strange part of this event, as soon as I said those words ""Well whatever it was I guess I'm not seeing it again"", I noticed to my right at about 3 o'clock something moving very slowly coming right at my direction.  But this time it was something totally different from that of my first sighting, there was no light and it was coming towards me very slowly.  It was again an estimated 5 to 6 hundred feet up, about the same altitude as the first object I saw, and I could tell it was going to come right over my head.  Again, this time there was no light and I watched it get slowly closer and closer.  Then, it got right over my head as I was looking straight up at it and got a ve! ry good look.  When I focused in on it I got the strangest feeling inside of me that this thing wasn't “bad” but that it wasn't “good” either.  It never stopped moving but it was moving very slowly and when it got right over my head I could see the bottom of it from the Lihue city lights reflecting off of it.  It looked like a bottom of a frying pan with its re-entry burns on its bottom, a disk approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter at about 500 feet up.  If you held a quarter over your head at arm’s length, that's about how big it looked to me from my vantage point.  And then this part was really weird, when it got right over my head I could see around it's perimeter an orange energy field, like an aura around its perimeter.  Then again, with no lights it slowly went right over Lihue into the mist and that was it.  I was agape and I couldn't believe what I just saw.  I was tempted to chase after it with my bike but I decided not to because I was kind of freaked out. The next day I went to the Garden Island newspaper and after checking and asking all sorts of people I found no one who saw either the first lighted device or the later disk. Till this day I have found no one who saw it and I still wonder what it actually was, either an alien or military devices.  Kauai does have a known top secrete missile base but I myself believe it was a space craft.  My theory is the first light ball was a remotely controlled device that either was mapping the island or recording some other type of information, and the disk I saw afterwards was the mother craft.  But I guess I'll never know because I haven't seen either since. So that's my personal UFO story and Mr. Davenport you're the first official UFO expert I have told this too.  It was a remarkable experience and it changed my thinking from UFOs being make believe stuff to something as real as we are.  Has it changed my life all that much?  Not really but I sure get strange reactions when I tell the story to folks.  If you would ever like for me to elaborate with the details a little more, and if anyone else you'd like me to share this with I'd be more than happy too. Thank you, ((name deleted))",2012-09-24T00:00:00,21.977,-159.3911

It was a thunderstorm, after midnight a loud thunder woke me up out my sleep. I looked around, and there it appeared at my window. It was a radioactive green glow, it didn't have a body like a human. I would say the shape looked like, a ghost. But only the subject's body material was moving. Also see threw. The eyes and mouth looked the same, like cut out. But only that's how it was made. Understand it didn't look nothing like E.T.  Or how the movies predict aliens look.  It wasn't shape with arms,legs or a neck.  Must I remind you it was up close in personal at my window. Long story short, it made a weird long howl sound.  And the whole time during the scream, it had me frozen with my eyes popped   open like a zombie. I could not move at all.  It made me look directly in its black holes.  Black holes are the eyes. The scream lasted about five seconds.  And it v! anished. In thin air at my window.

My friend J* and I, both around 20 years old, were having coffee in Blacksburg around early evening (4-6 pm). We were quite bored and not quite sure what to do with our evening. (We had consumed NO alcohol and NO drugs. Just coffee/tea.) J* suggested visiting an abandoned house on a Mountain just outside of Blacksburg called Brush Mountain (Turn left onto country road off of Rt 460 on the way towards West Virginia, the house is now gone). The house was used infrequently by high school kids and college students for late night parties. It was old (1930s to 1940s) and apparently  neat to visit since it had a great view of Blacksburg and was kind of a creepy old house. I conceded to the idea and we left, with no idea what we were in for.  We arrived at the house with some difficulty since the country road, not much wider than one car width, was washed out in spots and very bumpy. There were ditches on both sides of the road making it impossible to turn around while on it.  After smoking a few cigarettes(tobacco, not pot. I am very serious here.)and inspecting the house, we realized that it was getting dark and we had no flashlights. We decided to leave. We got in the car and made our way back down the same country road.  I must confess that I have a hard time remembering ""coming up on"" the object. I think it was such a shock first seeing it that I can't remember how we came upon it. I THINK that we came over a hump in the road and all of a sudden there it was in the middle of the road approximately 35-40 feet away. The way the road was, you couldn't see all the way down it, it would curve up and then down occasionally, until it finally took you back to Rt 460. I am actually a little bothered by not remembering the minutes just before seeing it, but I don't think this is a case of missing time.  J* slowed the car to a crawl and finally stopped approximately 30-35 feet from the object. It may have been closer than that. I am trying to be as conservative as possible in regards to distance. It was absolutely no more than 40 feet away from us at any time during the encounter-I have personally walked the distance and I am positive of this fact.  The object was a glowing ball of light, a perfect sphere approximately 3 1/2 to 4 feet in diameter. It was hovering, without ""bobbing"" or moving at all, approximately 2 1/2 - 3 feet off of the ground, perfectly still, in the middle of the road. Not to the left, not to the right-but dead center in the middle. It made no sound at all.  J* and I were so shocked, we locked the doors to the car and made sure the windows were tightly closed (rolled up). Of course this sounds ridiculous, but it seemed the right thing to do at the time. After exclaiming to each other with numerous expletives, etc. I seem to remember J* driving a little closer. I'm not sure how much closer, but it wasn't much. There was no way, as I indicated earlier, of turning around on the road. We stared at the object for approximately 1 minute. I have timed this by running over the events in real time (initial shock/locking doors/taking briefly/then staring.  I turned to J* after this minute and said ""Turn your brights on it"". J* turned on his brights and left them on. Immediately the sphere rose up apporximately 2-3 feet more, paused, and then TOOK OFF down the road at a speed that to this day I find hard to explain or even describe. Fast. Very, very fast. You could see the illusion of a tail or the object elongated for a 1/2 second as it took off. Again, with no sound.  J* tried to talk, but we were both in shock. I said something, also laced with expletives, to the effect of ""Get me off this ******* Mountain and then we can talk about it!""  We had to, of course, go down the road to get back to 460. And this was also were the sphere had gone. It did not take off going up but down the very road we needed to traverse. I remember our eyes were peeled on that road until we got back down to the highway. We got back into town, banged on a friends apartment until they let us in and proceeded to FREAK OUT for hours over the incident.  For many years I have described this object as a ghost and the encounter as a ghost story. There is a good reason for this. The object, which we both saw in the GREATEST DETAIL, was rather ""ghostly"". This is very important and I want investigators (Govt. or otherwise) to take note of this. Whipping around the sphere was a wispy, plasma like substance, almost exactly the type of thing we associate with ghosts. None of this substance extended more than a half foot away from the sphere and was constantly in motion around it. The object was very bright, but did not seem to light the area around it very much. I would say that the sphere itself was luminous ""white"" or a ""colorless"" kind of white, and the substance around it was only slightly darker. And by darker I mean it was white too, but more off white. Beneath this plasma that was constantly whipping around, the object was a PERFECT SPHERE. Not oval, but mathematically spherical.  I do not know what I saw, but I saw it at very close range. I am to understand that this qualifies as a close encounter of the first kind.  The date I entered is an approximation, but I have been able to deduce that the encounter absolutely occurred in late Summer of 1996. My friend whose apartment we visited right after the encounter only lived in that apartment during this time.  I am very sorry that we did not get a picture of the object, but this was before cell phone cameras and we had no idea we would need a camera beforehand. So frustrating.

We were having dinner at one of the restaurants near the PETRONAS twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur. It was a beautiful evening with clear skies and we sat outside at the waterfront. Towards the end of the dinner I noticed three huge bright lights that appeared to be “hanging” between the towers slightly above the very top, positioned in a sort of triangular shape.  At first I thought it might be part of a marketing strategy, but since the three lights were stationed in the same spot the entire time I started to become curious. I got up to get I closer look.  As I was walking around the waterfront I stopped people to ask them if they have seen those lights before. Most of the people I spoke to were from Kuala Lumpur and they all admitted that they’ve never seen such lights before between the towers.  Lots of people stopped and stood in awe of the lights.  We speculated what it could be and tried to determine if the lights could be a reflection coming from the towers. In the end we concluded that we were fortunate to see a UFO together, laughed and left it at that. Around 15 minutes after everything settled down again my friends and I decided to return to the hotel.  The lights were still there, hanging motionless in the sky. I could not take my eyes of the objects.  As we were walking towards the street to get into a taxi the lights started moving and it appeared to me that they were now following us.  My friend who remained very skeptical throughout the night now started getting very nervous and we got real anxious when the lights were still following us as we drove off in the taxi. After a while we lost sight of the lights as the other buildings obstructed our view. Unfortunately I did not have a camera with me to capture any of this.

On approximately February 10, 2004, at approximately 21:00, I was sitting in the backyard at my home when a low flying object began entering my field of vision.  It was flying from the NW to the SE.  I was moving extremely slowly and began to obscure a large portion of the night sky.  When it came more fully into view it appeared to be the size of 2 to several football fields.  There were lights along the sides of the object on the underneath side.  Or at least that  is how it appeared. I was viewing it from the ground to its underneath side.  It moved so slowly that it was eerie.  Also, it was so quiet that it seemed to consume all sound as it progressed in its path.  I immediately went into my home and called my son out to see it.  By the time I got back outside and my son joined me (just seconds), two identical objects came into view.  They were flanking the lead object - or grouping of lights - to its port and aft positions and a little behind it. The pr! ecision of the formation was remarkable. The night was clear, and the sky was full of stars.  The 3 objects almost completely filled the sky in a 45 degree vertical sightline and a 180 degree horizontal sightline.  They were huge and completely silent.  For the next 2 - 4 minutes, my son and I watched as they continued flying over the horizon of surrounding homes.  They continued to proceed at the same height and speed until they were out of our sight.  However, as they were almost out of sight, my son recalls that the sides of the objects appeared to undulate, in a similar manner as a bird flapping its wings a little.  They appeared to be flying so low that I could imagine being able to reach them by firing a rifle, if I shot up vertically when they flew over.  The stars were obscured as they flew over us,  and the stars could be seen again as the objects passed.  I did not report this before, as I did not know to whom to report it, did not know if anyone would care, and wa! s afraid of ridicule.

I was out there driving all alone when I saw a light over to my right not that far away from my car over the desert landscape.  I thought it was strange and wondered what it was.  I assumed it was a spotlight from some crop duster airplane or something.  But the weird thing was that this light pretty much paced my car and flew along side my car at about 65 MPH for a full minute or so.  I kept wondering what it was, and was trying to keep my eye on the road and also on the light to try to figure out what it was.  After about a minute, the light seemed to have enough of pacing my car, and it bolted 90 degrees away from my car flew incredibly fast over the desert landscape and flew over the horizon in about two or three seconds, way faster than any commercial plane or jet could travel.  Was this a spaceship containing aliens?  It didn’t seem too big to me.  It kind of seemed like a ball of light.  It was hard to guage the size of the craft (if it was a craft), but I would guess the diameter was no more than six feet tall or wide.  It seemed more like a ball o! f light maybe three feet wide to me.  How fast was it going to get from my car to the horizon and over the san on the horizon?  It’s ahrd to say, but it was fast enough for me to say, “Whoa!”.  At the time, I thought that the light was probably part of some military aircraft experiments the US Army was doing tests on in the desert.  But  if it weren’t a military vehicle, it would be easy to jump to the conclusion that this might have been an alien spacecraft.  As far as I know, nothing on earth could travel that fast.  Also, there was no engine sound, no sonic boom, just silence.  Pretty cool, huh?  It definitely shook me up. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Better late than never.  In September, 2007 (I am not sure of the exact date, but it was in the middle of the month), my wife and I saw unusual activity in the sky above Clearwater Beach, Florida, and the Gulf of Mexico.  Although we now live in Clearwater, Florida, at the time we were vacationers to Clearwater Beach, annually. We were staying at our usual accommodations, a hotel located on the street that is directly across from the beach. As was our custom, we were booked into a room on the fourth floor, which is the top floor of the hotel. The room has a balcony which overlooks the hotel pool and gives us a scenic view of the beach and the Gulf of Mexico.  It happened to be the last night of a week-long vacation. We sat on the balcony to watch the sunset and remained there for several hours afterwards.  At approximately 2300 hours (11 p.m), I happened to notice a bright light on the horizon. Seldom have I ever seen boats out on the Gulf late at night, but I had no reason to believe it was anything other than a watercraft. At first, I thought the light was moving north to south, parallel to the horizon, but soon I realized it was traveling east-west, heading in our general direction.  I recall that the sky was clear and there was a half moon that evening. Given that it was the month of September, it was off-season. Very few people were out and about that night and there was very little in the way of automobile traffic.  As the light got closer, the first thing I concluded that if it didn’t turn, the craft would be heading directly for the beach, not the harbor. As the light got even closer, I knew it was not a watercraft. It was an aircraft, flying at low altitude, but well above the water. It continued flying at the same altitude, but at what I would consider much too slow for an airplane or jet. My guess was that it was a helicopter.  The only thing I could see were lights at the front of the craft, seemingly encased in an elongated oval cover. I could not see how many lights were within this elongated cover, but I am sure there were at least three, maybe as many as five. These lights were white, not unlike headlights on an automobile. Since they were not pointed at me, it’s not possible to say how bright the lights were. But from my view on the fourth floor of the hotel, I would conclude that they were much brighter than halogen bulbs on standard cars.  It did not fly directly overhead, but about 3 to 4 blocks north of our location, above Pier 60, which is a local tourist attraction. It was soon out of our sightline. If this was all that happened, I probably would not have remembered it.  But over the next 30-40 minutes, this event occurred three more times, at least 5 -10 minutes apart.  Same thing each time: light on the horizon, approaching the beach, and finally out of sight.  There was one major difference. Each time it passed, it was at a slightly different line of latitude.  The second time, it was a mere block away from our location, the third time, it was directly overhead, and the final time, it was closer to the location of its first pass, near the pier.  I cannot say whether it was one craft that had turned about and made four passes or four separate crafts. But on its third pass, directly overhead, I was able to make the following observations:  1.	The front of the craft where the lights were, seemed to be rounded, much like the edge of a Frisbee. The only other part of the craft that was clearly observable was the area immediately around the elongated light cover. The lights reflected off this part of the craft as though the body of the craft was made of black chrome, but somewhat duller, like black patent leather shoes.  2.	What I am less sure of is the shape of the craft. Based on the front of the craft, I would say that it was saucer shaped. But as it passed overhead, there was something shadowy about the rest of the craft. It was as though the craft temporarily blocked out the starlight above. I had the sense that it was more like a boomerang.  3.	I’m not good at measuring things in terms of inches, feet and yards. But if I had to guess the altitude of the craft, I would say that it was flying at a level that was five to six times the height of our hotel, a four story building. My wife and I disagree on this; she believes it flew at a higher altitude. Either way, it was closer to the ground than any other craft in flight that I’ve ever seen, other than watching a helicopter take off.  4.	While it did not hover at any point, it moved much like a helicopter, and certainly moved at a speed I associate with helicopters.  5.	This craft was absolutely noiseless. No sound of an engine nor a rotary blade.  After the craft made its last pass (or after the fourth craft passed), the show was over.  Sadly, since it was the last night of our stay, I didn’t bother to recharge the battery for my camera, otherwise I would have recorded the last two passes for sure.  About my wife and I: we had not consumed any intoxicants that evening; we are both college graduates; and, we were both professionals. My wife was a nurse at a convalescent home and I was about to retire after 30 years as a public school teacher.  As for why it has taken me 5 years to report this:  1.	It was late at night and this craft(s) did not seem to pose a threat. 2.	I had no idea who to report it to, inasmuch as the U.S. Air Force has washed its hands of UFO investigations. 3.	We checked the local news on television the following morning and there was no indication that anyone else had reported it, or at least the local stations were not covering such an event. 4.	With Clearwater Beach being so close to MacDill AFB, the possibility occurred to me that I may have seen military aircraft, secret or not.  I finally decided to report this “sighting” based on what I’ve read about the raid to capture/kill Osama Bin Laden. In published reports, it has been stated that one of the concerns about the mission was that the helicopters that transported the Navy SEALS into Pakistan, while visually stealthy, were not as audibly stealthy as they would have preferred. The mission into Pakistan took place almost 4 years after my “sighting”.  I can tell you that if it had not been for the lights, I probably would never have noticed my craft(s). The craft(s) was/were virtually stealthy; almost invisible and certainly without noise. If the U.S. military developed such capabilities, I wondered why they had not already been applied to currently used aircraft, including those helicopters used on the SEALS’ mission.  As for my own reaction to the events of that night, the only word I can use is “fascination”. I was not frightened not was I excited about the possibility I was seeing UFO’s. It was what it was. But after considering the technology this craft or crafts had, I can’t rule out the possibility of extraterrestrial activity.  I am very aware that more recently, hoaxes in this location happen often, with Chinese lanterns being used frequently. But these hoaxes tend to happen at the height of tourist season, not long after sunset, when there is a greater chance of witnesses. In our case, it was later in the evening and, other than my wife and I, no witnesses to speak of.  If any of the information I have supplied ties in with other sightings in Clearwater or elsewhere, I hope it is helpful. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

On 10 Aug 2009, at approximately 22:30 PM (CST), I was inside Minot AFB, ND, while physically located at the parking lot of the temporary lodging facility (TLF).  The sky just turned from twilight to dark when I looked North East in the sky and saw a peculiar object fluttering what I thought at first was a moth directly in front of my face and tried swatting at it.  As I continued to stare at this thing, I noticed it was flying towards me and was actually materializing what I could describe best as possibly from being invisible to visible, such as a cloaking device that re-materializes after being invisible.  The object was flying overhead towards and adjacent to the base's main gate traveling from East to West when I suddenly realized as it flew closer to me and directly over my head that it was triangular in shape object and had an altitude of approximately 3,500 feet.  It flew very slow, perhaps my best estimate was 150-200 mph, maybe slower.  If I wasn't! looking in the sky at the right place and time, this object would have flown right over my head without me ever knowing or recognizing it, because the object had a dull/ginger/stealth-like radiated light s on each corner, perhaps more lights in between them (can't remember specifically as this incident occurred 2 years ago) and was also totally silent--made no noise.  Strangely, this craft was lead by a smaller vehicle of some sort.  It was dark now in the sky and I couldn't make out the exact size and shape of this craft, but realized it was what I could describe best as a small ""pod"" perhaps.  The pod was approximately 50-100 meters in front of the triangle UFO.  After the triangle and pod flew over my head, it took about 5-7 seconds for me to realize and sink in my head what I actually saw.  I yelled for my 16 year old son to come outside and help me look for these UFOs in case they flew over my head again.  I explained briefly to my son what I had seen and fo! r him to look for anything flying nearby that looked suspiciou! s and re sembled to what I explained to him what I just saw.  My son recognized and saw both vehicles fly right over our heads again exactly on the same course and direction as they flew over me the first time.  I believe both crafts flew over us approximately 3 or 4 times total as I remember on one of the passes it appeared the triangle briefly stopped in mid-air directly over us and then proceeded to fly onward.  My son and I saw how creepy/dull/ and distorted these ""ginger"" lights were on the triangle UFO, which gave us an eerie feeling about this entire encounter.  What I thought turned out to be only a few passes over our heads of this UFO incident, actually turned-in to be what I still refer to my son to this day as a ""UFO air show"".  Approximately 15-20 minutes into the sighting, I looked straight East in the sky and recognized a swept wing formation of approximately 30 small yellow lights flying directly over the main gate and just South of me bearing a straight East to West trajectory.  Their altitude was also approximately 3,500 ft and were traveling about 150-200 mph as well (it was dark so there is a high probability of error on the exact altitude and speed on all UFOs seen on this evening).  As the objects continued to fly closer to me and my son, they began to perform an inverted barrel roll as all lights maintained and were strictly aligned and clustered in varying degrees from each other while maintaining the swept-wing formation.  After the objects completed the roll, they were directly positioned South from me and my son, when all of a sudden all 30 lights were ""zigzagging"" amongst and between one another without touching.  The objects continued to travel South and out of sight and r! emained in their swept-wing formation until we last saw these lights, the stealth-like triangle UFO, and lead ""pod""/craft lastly traveling together in a pack as they were East of me and my son, bearing a straight Northerly direction and flew away until they were totally out of sight.  My son and I remained outside and watched the skies for approximately 15 minutes longer as I estimated the entire UFO sighting lasted maybe 45 minutes total.  I have always been interested in aviation and UFOlogy as a child, to present as I am now a 48 year old adult (46 at the time of this sighting) being retired US Air Force, after 24 years total active duty service.  What I saw, especially due to there being no sound and the stealth-like appearance, radiated and ginger colored lights located on this triangular UFO has made me determined this was not the stealth bomber as I have seen it physically fly in-person twice in my life time while on active duty in the US Air Force, but remarkably I can't relate how this lead ""pod""/craft tied into this sighting accompanied with the swept-wing formation of approximately 30 small yellow lights. I attempted at first to call the Operation Squadron's control tower to see if any on-duty personnel witnessed the incident, but decided to change mind and refrained from calling after thinking twice about all this since I was on active duty service at the time.  I refrained from reporting ! this sighting as I didn't know exactly who to report this incident as my friend knew and referred me to your agency for reporting purposes.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,,

There were three separate UFO’s all in a straight row for a total of nine lights.  They were moving very slow over the saddle of the mountain.

The lights were very bright I mean like football stadium lights and they were lighting up everything out there under it from about sixty feet off the ground.  You could see cactus and rocks really clear too just like a bright sunny day. It was so dark out there ! that I could not see any sides or edges to what ever it was.

This sighting took place over my neighborhood in Colorado Springs.  I was parked near my home to finish listening to the last part of a Coast to Coast show.

They soon passed and that was the end of that. But anyway, soon after i looked up above me and their was this silent sphere which was basically just a black ball (the size of a Football) which had a dull orange haze around it just hovering right above me as if it was watching me. It reminded me of a probe. I had a small green laser pen on me at the time and i shined it at the thing a few times and it did not respond at all. After the the excitement i then realised that i could be in danger, so i ran in to the house to fetch my Mother and her friend who is also a RAF pilot. By the time we got back down in to the garden the object was already floating off below tree top level. So as we watched it i again zapped it with my laser pen until ! it vanished in to the distance towards other houses and the local river Wye. The first time we/i ever saw the objects was in Aug 06 at about 9pm when about 20-30 of these orange lights were coming in from the Wales direction in single column formation and they all vanished in the same spot as they got there. These things can be seen most nights here, and they often come in different colours. Mainly bright stars in disguise if you like. Its unlikely in my opinion that its the SAS camp down the road causing all this as many speculate.

We arrived @ Smith Island approx. 9 AM.  We anchored and finally began fishing on the East side of the Southern tip of Smith Island @ 915.  @ 930 we started hearing a rumbling sound.  It was a very clear, sunny day with one or two small clouds. The water was like glass - no swells or wind. The rumbling sound became louder and louder, seemingly emanating from the South/Southwest.  We looked around for any aircraft overhead but saw nothing - not even a contrail. The rumbling turned into a deafening, thunderous roar - the sound slowly moved from the South/Southwest to the North/Northwest and eventually died back down as quickly as it came - the whole thing lasting about 6 minutes.  It was so loud at one point I could feel the roaring/thundering sound within my body. I remember telling the Captain I expected to see a wall of water coming from the West.  The Captain had 4 years experience in these waters and was adimant that he had never heard anything like it before. We never saw an aircraft or contrail.  The next thing that came to mind was possibly a meteor but given the deafening roar and how long it lasted we should have seen something.

I slowly tilted my head back to look at the night sky and if I had not, I would have completely missed it.  I still have a hard time trying to estimate its size when I think of it. It was flying very low and was massive (about 4 football fields in length or larger) directly overhead. It made no sound or lights, blending with the night sky. The first thing that came to mind when I saw the shape was a stealth bomber but as I studied it, the two bottom corners were rounded like a boomerang and it came in on the back to a flat edge (not full triangle). The coloring is hard to describe. I had to stare really hard to make out what looked like a camo pixel design of dark greys and blacks, but not painted, more like each color was a separate panel. It was flying fast enough that this only lasted about 30 seconds (despite its size) before disappearing into the dark after passing overhead. During the entire time I had not moved and felt like almost numb as I watched it. I have searched UFO sightings and military planes but nothing comes close to what I witnessed in shape and size for ones posted online are either a complete pointy triangle shape or skinny boomerang shape. I am posting it now because of another recent UFO sighting (not the same type unfortunately) has increased my interested in this phenomenon. I would love to discuss this with someone who has had the same sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was in my yard one fall night letting waiting for my dog to do his thing when I looked up and saw a jupiter-like bright object in the sky. My house yard faces northwest so that Polaris is in the right corner and the sun sets in the left corner. The star I saw shouldn't have been there. I was just northwest of Polaris, a few degrees  higher and as bright as Jupiter. I watched it with intrigue for a minute or so and then the object got smaller before my eyes - I mean in a matter of a minute or so - until it was a red dot and then vanished. When I first looked at it I assumed it was an airplane, but it didn't move or flash. Then I wondered if there was a comet I didn't know about.  When the thing go small and vanished I really became puzzled and told my wife and, later, some people ! I know.  Was it a rocket sent up by some ameteur rocket club? Whatever it was it moved away from the earth into space at a tremendous speed - the time it went from a Jupiter sized glowing object to a faint red dot was only a  matter of a minute or two.  I have never been able to reconcile this event with anything that makes sense so I am reporting this in the hope of some explaination.

They where looking for someone named the Omega.  They talked about several thing but I never saw who was talking and that I would know them because they would talk blended with the wind.   Then they wanted me to come outside so I did and when I walked outside I noticed that there was an eclipe created by the moon. When I heard voice that told me to look up and I saw a ship but it was barely visable.  Then the craft disappeared and tha was the last time I saw that craft.  A series a event happened like someone was test my knowledge of events of the past, present, and future.  There is a park close to my house where a voice asked me to come and me someone. It was four right angles as I was guided my the voice and when I came to the park   I was instructed to go in a certain direction an push a spot in an figure that leaned against a series of triangles,retangles, that leaned to th! e left.  Then I was to stand ther but before this had  happened I saw a native American supposely to be a tribal nation looked like the wrong tribe but the eyes looked diffent than I have seen before because the one I saw that was in the mall had eyes that were blue but with white kind like specks not like or iris's. So, first went the port-a- pot when I came out then I walked to that structure but nothing then I went an sat on then bench. It was raining lighting an a figure appeared the being was almost light grey but see through at the same time. The being looked me in my face an I remember looking down an seeing a tranlucent worm that had what looked like squres and tringles in side it's body. Then I turn to leave an the being was gone and I went back home. I also remember talking to someone or a family from the voice I heard was a kid,mother,father, grandpa. We had several coversation about various subjects.I remember also at the mall the other which apeared human as we ! know; was a brown haired woman she motioned towards a shirt bu! t didn't speak. I wasn't a weird was more like why was contacted but something went wrong. One minute I was sitting in the forest at night still talking to someone but I heard a noice an out the corn of my eye I was a slinder figure with long hair move across the path with quickness; then he was gone.The srangest thing was the government made annoucement that they were conducting an test an if we heard something ignore it. Several day turned to months then some start yelling at me and one day while I was sitting in my chair  Iheard a strang sharp noise so loud that it made my ears hurt that I had to leave my home an go out side. I went to the doctors an he refered me to the audiolegist and they informed me that I had tenitious. An then about four months or so the same sound happened agin this it last sometimes fours and for several days. I t seemed like every where I went somebody or some being was testing my ears until I cried out in pain and  I heard a voice that told who ever was! doing that insane test to stop because it was hurting his ears.I went back a gain to the audiologist this time the test showed a 5% hearing an now my tenitious was worsted than before. Then thing started happening in my home that never happened before; like items coming up missing and feeling like being wanted to look over my body naked. I felt buring temporary feeling on my throat while I sat in my chair doing my art. The bed moved in a wave like motion but I never saw who was in my room. I am a dibetic so one night I thought I was having a diabetic attack because I feel some leechs like suck ing on my kindey areas. I felt thing I never felt before on my back thight lie two snail like feeling but when I wipped my my leg because I I though something might have crawled on me because I slept on the floor but when I did that it went away an never came back. Because of the tentious that I have now every thinh is amplfied because the ears is damaged an now some of those voice I! hear now screems.But one night when I slept I happed to feel ! my mouth mve but when I looked up I was a light green being with maybe arms or tentagles sort floating above me; then I went back to sleep. Another time I was sleep  an I happened to awake an I saw a pink and blue want appeared to be  what we call a snail an I looked an rolled over an went back to sleep. An between that time some people were standing out side an I didn't think much about expect when I walked pasted someone standing there an he spoke but he did'nt open his mouth to speak and spoke back with my mouth as we do.  So many thing happen I didn't know what to think then something happen while I was sitting in my chair; I felt something crawl through my chair an I jumped up an something in now on my back especially every time I sit on any like right now. I went to the doctor an to see if he could see any thing but he could not; its not a pain it is ignoring to have something you can not see but on your back on the spinal cors, kidney, and tailbone. All of this has been happen! ing as this day of Sept.10,2012; from what I can understand some if not all hate by who ever the beings are especial African American why they don't say. One day I am living a normal not I am just living why did this only god know but I will stand up for all those who can not stand because as the united stated denies the excistance or extresstrail that is a ball faced lie for now I am also brought from the darkness to the light.

It was a warm evening with good visablity. While I was playing my flute, all of a sudden I saw in the corner of my eye a bright white light coming in to my view from the southeast part of the sky. I stopped playing and watched as this bright white globe streamed across the sky from  (southeast to north), desending from right to left at about a 40 degree angle towards the ground. It was very close, not far away. I did'nt know what it could be. I really didn't have time to think about it, it happened really fast. It looked like it was just above the greenbelt behind my house. It appeared like the full moon, yet it was at least twice as large as a full moon. Also, the moon was behind me and was only partially lit, maybe a 3rd of the moon was lit. So it definitly wasn't the moon.  It almost seemed like it was just east of the house next to me, maybe a little further, maybe a 100 yards, where there is a green belt that separates our houses from the apartments that are on the top of the hill. As it streamed across the sky, after about 4 or 5 seconds it produced two little white flare like jets of fire, one on the top, and one on the bottom of the globe. The outside part  of the globe then started spinning in a clockwise motion while it was descending, the inside of the globe was stationary. This lasted about 3 or 4 seconds. Then, it fell towards the ground. When it was about to hit the ground I, stood up and screamed "" Oh My God "", as I expected to hear a large explosion. But it went behind the trees and dissappeared with no sound. The whole time of the sighting, there was no sound coming from it. I looked at my watch and it read 10:35 PM CST. I want to repeat that this globe was large and moving slowly at a 40 degree angle downwards. It wasn't the moon, it wasn't an airplane or helicopter. I've never seen a ufo before,and I never expected I would ever see something like this. It's ! the most incredible thing I've ever seen in my life. In regard! s to my feelings, I started thinking about the events that are happening around the world. In Japan, New Zealand, and the volcanoe in Indoensia erupting. I started becoming concerned that this was a sign or a warning. I was worried that more was about to happen, but it didn't.  At least not last night.  These were just my feelings.  The experience was very intense and I still have so many questions.  That's really all I can convey at this time.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,32.757366003227546,-97.34710441097364

Let me first state that I have not shared this report with friends or family because it's not exciting, but after hearing your request for these kinds of sightings on Coast to Coast am a few months ago, I thought I should at least tell you what I saw. It was just before dusk last year, July 4, 2011. The sky was in twilight between 8-9pm in the small township of Goodland, just north of Imlay City Michigan. I had finished a late dinner and was standing in my yard looking south. Goodland is a small farming community. Each house is separated by farmland. South of me there are only 6 to 8 homes within my sight line. A few neighbors were lighting off some small fireworks in their yards which had my attention directed south and low on the horizon. Amid the small pops of bottle rockets and the like I noticed roughly 6-8 lights hanging just above the horizon at an indeterminate distance. The ground rolls slightly for miles and there are several tree lines that merge making the distance too difficult to judge. The dots of light were red, pink and yellow. At first they appeared to have the same glow of some of the larger fireworks you'd see at a festival, but these orbs were slowly rising. As the lights  rose higher I called to my wife to come see. She came in time to witness the lights organize from a loose arrangement to lining up in a straight vertical line evenly spaced apart. From that position they slowly faded away over a period of about 1-2 minutes. The top one faded first followed by each subsequent lower one till they were gone. I think the fade was a product of them moving off dire! ctly south, one by one. The whole event took 3-5 minutes at most.  This being the 4th of July with fireworks at the time, I figured there was no sense reporting this sighting. Additionally, there is an air force base to the south east of me, (Selfridge ANG) which is 40+ miles away.  I have not seen those lights again.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,43.068,-83.0379

I just happened to go to this website today, (almost a year later) to see if maybe anyone had reported something. I typed in ""Perkasie 2011"" and I saw a post and the date. I did not remember the date so I went back and checked my facebook postings. I posted my comment on August 26th 2011. Same date.

I was sitting in my living room and I saw something at the corner of my eye which my first reaction to was, ""fire"". There is a small airport near here so my first thought was that perhaps a plane was on fire nearby. I said to my husband, ""what is that?"" He went to the window, stood there for what seemed! like a long time and then said "" I have no idea what that is."" This really scared me, and I went on my front lawn and looked up. There were multiple lights spaced varying distances from each other that would appear and disappear. I first thought they were independent of each other against the sky, but to my total astonishment they suddenly all moved together at a bizarre speed to the right. When this happened it was evident the lights were all within the same object -that only became visible because it moved so suddenly to the right. It then just seemed to disappear, perhaps backwards at an impossible speed?? Whatever this object was would have had to been gigantic - I had chills and was completely frightened. Flood/search lights came on at the airport- or from somewhere, for about 10 minutes following this... if anyone can explain this, I would really appreciate it- because it makes no sense to me.

I was driving home from work from Little Rock to conway in normal evening traffic.  It was dark.  I was driving north on a 4 lane hwy with a large grass median in between and up ahead of me there appeared to be a 747 (my impression) coming towards me about to land on the freeway.  What I saw was a triangular arrangement of lights covering the expanse of the freeway slowly floating down towards the road, about half a mile ahead.  My impression was this was a landing aircraft with its nose in the air, coming directly towards me.  As it got closer it moved off to the side of the road and as I crossed the Arkansas river, it had stopped over the dam to my right and was just sitting there.  All I could see was three bright lights that weren't really illuminating anything.  About this time, all these cars around me lit up with these strange red lights in their dashboards - they didn't go round and round like a normal emergency light, they went side to side, were all red, and were i! n MANY cars ( don't know an exact number ) coming the other way and even driving right next to me, in front of me and behind me.  They all sped off the freeway on the dam exit towards where this thing was floating, probably ten cars in total.  Before the red lights turned on, on these cars, I had slowed down and rolled the windows down and couldn't hear a thing coming from whatever this thing was. I never heard a word about it from anyone, not in the news or television.  Years later I was watching a Discover channel UFO special about events in Belgium in 1989-1991 and there it was, exactly what I saw.  Granted, I never saw a distinct outline but if they said all this happened the night I saw what I saw, I would say, ""I saw that too"".",2012-08-05T00:00:00,34.737536276849646,-92.3631923627685

PBIA is also visible and we would see the planes coming in and out, after 3 years we would notice if flight patterns would change etc. On the evening of February 3rd 2012, I was in the kitchen (which looks directly out towards the big patio window) when I saw a HUGE orange orb fireball object heading south. There was no sound, in fact, you can see on my video how loud the music and everything was but planes regularly would drown out all the downtown noise. Given how many people were in the bars and on the street I couldnt believe I was the only one to see it. By the time I was able to get my phone to record, I had been observing the object for about a minute. The fireball/ orb got first was growing in size as it approached us then got smaller as it headed south, at one point I tried to rationalize it by thinking it was a natural occurrence but the sky was clear and there werent any storms or electricity in the air. In the video you can see it start to ascend and then almost disappear. It never fully went away, i was tracking it the whole time but seemed to change and blend in with the night sky. I even ques! tioned the object at one point bc it looked like a far off shuttle launch (being from so fla we can occasionally see a night launch) it eventually gained speed and began to glow brighter again. after where my video cuts off  the object continued to head up and ascend till it was parallel and blended in with the stars, at which point it hovered and changed color to match the stars (a sort of blueish color) After another 5 min of observing it in the same position i headed back in.  The video captured was with my iphone that was almost dead and completely full of data at the time. so when i went to stop the video my phone was off and after I rebooted it, the video was not stored.

I jumped out of the car and stood there and scanned the sky to the east.Within five seconds,here they come,from over the trees in the distance.Almost directly over me,I watched three bright orange lights fly out and turn slightly off to the northwest and kind of flicker out or disappear into the clouds.They seemed to fly together in a formation,but just as they veered off to the n.w.,the third one swung out a little longer than the other two and then made its turn and blinked out or went into the cloud. As I stared into the sky,seeing if they would reappear,I spot two more coming from the same path that the last three came from.They pretty much did the same thing as the last three. These lights had no sound that I could hear.They had no strobes or marker lights like normal aircraft.They were amber in color.I cant really say how high they were.Maybe,if I had to guess,five hundred to a thousand feet or so.

I subscribe to the “Heavens above” web site. On the evening of May 16 2012, around 22:50, I was on my patio when I looked up at the sky (almost clear of clouds), hoping to see a satellite or two. It was late dusk, and I could see the Great Bear and Polaris, but the majority of stars were not yet visible. Some 10°-12° south-east of the Great Bear, probably in Bootes (but I couldn’t yet see its stars), I saw a very bright yellow-orange object moving slowly SE-NW (at about the “speed” of a satellite). Its magnitude (brightness and dimension) was comparable to Venus (which was just above the W horizon at that time), i.e. about -4.5. Like Venus, it did not twinkle, but its edges were hazy. I didn’t hear any engine or propulsion noise (but a commercial jet aircraft went over about 15 minutes later heading SW-NE, and the noise of its engines was very faint). I thought it was the ISS (but its colour and brightness seemed unusual), and after watching it for about a minute I went inside to collect my binoculars, which took no more than 30 seconds, but when I was back on the patio the object had completely disappeared.  I waited a couple of minutes, thinking that it was behind cloud (but I couldn’t see any cloud), then I swept the region with my binoculars, without seeing anything other than the low-magnitude stars not yet visible to the naked eye. A visit to ""Heavens-above.com"" revealed that the ISS was not due to pass over my region at that time. Apart from ball lightning, I was unable to find a “natural” explanation, so I reported it (by email) to the French GEIPAN site. They were very responsive, but concluded that I had seen a satellite (IGS1B) which is out of control, and subject to surges of brightness and is becoming difficult to predict. In view of the colour and brightness of the object I saw, this does not convince me. I’m not aware of any satellite that is that bright (even the ISS doesn’t usually exceed a magnitude of -2), and its sudden disappearance is difficult to explain, even for an erratic satellite.

It glided very slowly, I decided to tail it on the road and as I did this it sped up.  So did I, it eventually turned vertically on its side and began wheeling itself up into the sky until it vanished out of sight. After that it took about 1week to appear later again, each time it appea! red it came earlier at first it was maybe around four then around 2 the last time about 11:35.We remember this one the best, it came out from the sky, this was the first time we saw where it came from. In the direction where it appeared I believe what they call a rainbow cloud is where we saw it coming from. IT came very close to where we were, about 20 feet away where I was able to tell every detail. It was disc shaped and it was not black, just metallic. Up close it spun like a top while still moving and it reflected the colors from all around it, the sky, the car, the roof, everything. I screamed from outside at my dad to get his camera because I refused to move, it bolted straight up into the sky at an incredible speed.

There was obvious panic in her voice so I rushed down the stairs to see what was wrong. Not knowing I would forever lose my skepticism. I hurried downstairs and out to the west facing front of my home.  My friend was on step up to her vehicle and pointing southward and her mom was standing in the middle of my yard dumbfounded as I was about to be. Streaking up from the south were three various colored orbs some distance part and bounding over themselves.  A group of dolphins racing ahead of a boat is best possible description I could use to describe the incredible orbs. I have never been so exillerated and frightened in my life. And never did my flight or fight instinct kick in harder then that moment. The three orbs varied in color from white,to blue, to green, and a pinkish red.  They had a subtle pulse as they flew. It occurred to my that arming myself was dumb and so was running so I took out my iphone and began to shoot video.  As I was getting phone out from pocket the three orbs seemed to morph into a single shape.  The entire time spinning in a barrel style roll.  The lights from the orb even elongated like a water balloon stretching.  Then they slowed down and began to hover in a non-standard almost wish-washy way. I got my phone on then and I'll let the video I will attach say the rest. Please note I do mention a helicopter about 2 minutes into video and I was referring to the chopper that is almost always in the sky by the highway near my home.

The movements were synchronized UFO Lights  Location: Warsaw, Poland, position: 52º12’23’’N,  21º00’53’’  E 3rd floor flat, west facing balcony. Date: 3 July 2012, time: 23.00-23:30 (GMT+2)  Description of the event I was in the flat and at about 23:00 hours I heard the sound of thunder. When I approached the balcony door to close it I could see lightning in the distance.  By chance I looked up and saw right above me in the sky a moving round white spot.  This light spot was moving with a constant speed in an anticlockwise direction along a circular path which was about 20º in diameter. It took about 20 seconds to complete one revolution. The centre of the circle was about 70º above the horizon.  The diameter of the light spot was about 2-3º, but it did not have clear edges.  The spot was not very bright but the light intensity was sufficient to see it clearly against a background of clouds which were at about 500-1000 m in altitude.  The spot’s light intensity distribution was not uniform but it had a bell like shape and its edges were blurred like car headlights in a dense fog.  I noticed that sometimes when a dark cloud formed which was below the normal cloud ceiling, the light spot was obstructed by or even disappeared behind it, meaning that the light originated from above the cloud. As the spot travelled along its circular path its shape changed depending on the clouds it passed through. The shape of the spot, which was normally round, could be oval or irregular with rays radiating from it. The radiating or branching rays were sometimes narrow and pointed.  These rays radiated in different directions, even up to 3-5º away from the centre of the spot.  However when the thickness of the clouds was uniform the shape returned to its circular form. After a few moments I noticed a second light spot which was very similar to the first. This second light spot also moved in a circular path which touched the first spots circular path (see Fig. 1). The second circular path had the same diameter as the first and was positioned to the right of the first circular path. Its centre was about 75º above the horizon meaning that the centres of both paths weren't in a horizontal plane.  The second spot was moving along its path in an anticlockwise direction with the same speed as the first one. Both lights met at the point where the two trajectories touched each other and at this point the lights overlapped in such a way that for a second only one spot was visible. This meant that the movement of both spots was synchronized for the duration of the observation. The shape of the second light spot changed in a similar way to that of the first, but at any given moment in time the two shapes were not identical because the spots passed through different clouds. When the clouds were uniform both lights had a similar circular-Gaussian shape. The lights sometimes disappeared when they passed through very thick cloud and after a moment reappeared at the appropriate points on their paths. I observed the lights with some breaks for about 30 minutes.  Since nothing changed during this time I stopped observation. Comment After analysis of the light spots I reached the conclusion that the sources of the lights had to be positioned in the clouds rather than above them. The source of the light would have had to have been in the shape of a ball sending rays in all directions and therefore the intensity of light viewed from underneath was Gaussian. If the source was above the clouds it would be difficult to explain the propagation of irregular rays from the spots in almost horizontal directions in the clouds. Also, the diameter of the spots would have had to have been much larger. If the source of light was above the clouds the light would have difficulty passing through it and generating a bright enough spot. This can be confirmed by the fact that when a dark cloud passed underneath, it completely obstructed the spots. Fig. 1  Showing circular paths of moving light spots.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,,

It appeared just beyond Jennette’s Pier, which is at MP 16.5, moved slowly north and before it moved directly over, still a bit south of us, it appeared to go out to sea and fade away. A minute or so later another one appeared and followed the same pattern. There were several more after that, always following the same pattern. This happened more than one evening. They were silent and did not seem to be “fiery” – just silent, orange orbs. I am not certain of the date, but know it was the first week of July very close to the 4th of July.  I actually called Jennette’s Pier to see if they knew anything about it or if it had originated with them, but the man I spoke to said he had no idea what I was talking about.  Since it was so close to July 4th, at first we assumed it was some kind of fireworks display, but that was not the case. The beach was very crowded in the evenings so I am sure there were other witnesses.  It was very striking as there was a full to almost-full blood red moon every night and it was quite clear.

Event duration 1 ~ 2 min. 4 reddish colored spheres in box formation; 1 witness. “UFO Report”  What follows is an eye witness account of an unusual sighting as reported by my very lucid 78 year old mother who was driving on her way home from work in early July.  She was compelled to pull off on the shoulder of the interstate and stop to better witness this unusual sighting.  To my knowledge this is the first and only time in her 78 years that she has ever witnessed anything of this nature. I’m a 58 year old former aviator; retired USAF veteran of 20 years, with thousands of hours of flight time on both the C-130E and the KC-10A.  I have also accrued several thousand hours flight time on the commercial DC-10-40 under contract with Japan Airlines; I am now retired.  I questioned and cross examined the witness my mother extensively about the particulars of this sighting, asking her to write down the details for her family as I thought it was unusual and important; she did not get around to it so the task fell to me.  She is not prone to flights of fancy and is very much a reflection of the no-nonsense generation that suffered through the Great depression and WWII.  I only wish I had seen something this amazing and unusual just once in all my years of flying. Date: July 8th or 9th 2012 during the evening hours at the onset of dusk; approximately 2000 ~ 2100 hrs local PST.  Sunset for Los Banos (a small town nearby) was listed as occurring at 2026 L on both days. Location: Approximately 7 miles past the town of Santa Nella, traveling north on interstate 5 (I-5).  Sighting was witnessed at this locale from the side of the interstate and adjacent to a farm and residential property several hundred feet west of interstate and just north of a large telecom tower, also on the west side as viewed on Google-map using satellite view. Duration:  approximately 1 ~ 2 minutes?  Description of objects: 4 illuminated spheres, pale red in color and flying in a box or square formation as they traversed the interstate from east to west (right to left in witnesses field of vision).  They appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 300 feet elevation, and may have been about the size of grapefruits or as large as basketballs, as it was difficult to determine exactly.  They were silent and did not make any noise or sound whatsoever. The four orbs or spheres continued crossing the interstate, leisurely headed in the direction of a residential farmhouse.  During this portion of their flight they changed position to resemble (in the words of the witness) a cigar-shape, with one red-sphere at each end and one on each side.  The witness tried desperately to ascertain if they were attached to a structure in any way, but could not make out anything solid or otherwise that would appear to connect them.  By now they were over the farmhouse and momentarily seemed to disappear behind it.  Next the witness noted that they (or it) just shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed, further noting that if she had blinked she might have missed their departure thinking they (it) had just vanished. WX:  Was clear with no clouds or obstructions to hamper line of sight. There were no other witnesses to her knowledge as the interstate was briefly deserted at this particular moment with no passing traffic; which may seem unusual but is certainly not impossible for brief periods of time at this location.

I had been doing it for weeks (maybe months) when in the middle of my playing I heard a shrill, high pitched sound with a slight warble, (a fast warble) that scared the s*#! out of me!  I was absolutely PETRIFIED, and couldn't even move!   After what seemed like minutes, which was probably only a few seconds, I forced my body to move, first with one foot, then the other, to open the house door and once inside, made a streak to the living room where my sister and mother were located.  They knew from the “white complexion” and big eyes that I WAS NOT JOKING!   At the time, they did not truly believe that what I was telling them was a fact, or just a little boy hearing “noises”.  They suggested that one of our three dogs was “howling” at my Trombone escapades. Even at the age of 10 years I'd heard many a dog howl.....THAT NOISE WASN'T EVEN CLOSE IN SOUND to a dog's howl.  The sheer intensity, evenness and consistency of that sound WAS NOT A DOG!   After a short time, my mother and sister persuaded me to go back outside with them.  Even to this day, I know they think they “know better” than the kid.  However, they do realize and admit that I was scared to the point of “looking like a ghost”! That “little incident” was enough to curtail my evening “TAPS” playing.  P.S. We were living about 5 miles north of Terrebonne, Oregon, a rural farming community in central Oregon.

Several hundred people were in attendance at this fair.  There were numerous rides for the kids and there were plenty of colored flashing lights all over the place.  One of my friend's dad was an amateur astronomer and had set up his telescope for people to see the moon and the planets. At some point, a UFO appeared out of nowhere.  It was a silvery flattened disk with 2 or 3 portholes on the side. It was not a shiny silver color but had a sort of dullness to it.  It remained completely motionless over the large field where the fair was in progress.  It had an oscillating glow between red and green.  I cannot recall how high the UFO was but you could see it fairly well with the naked eye.  Many people observed the UFO through the telescope.  When I looked through the telescope, I could see that it appeared to be fairly bright inside the UFO but I did not see any life or movement inside.  Some one placed a call to either the local police or to the Tennessee Air National Guard which was located just a few miles away from the school. Two (2) jets were scrambled, and you could hear them approaching very quickly.  As they approached, the UFO took off at a very oblique angle, no sound was made, and the departure was faster than you could blink your eyes. I am now 62 years old, and I have never forgotten that night.  From time to time, I have tried to find information on the internet about this incident but without success.

It was years before I told ANYONE about this incident. It was in October of 1964 or 1965, and it was the general deer hunting season. I'd followed in my Dad's steps and loved to hunt and fish. Since we lived about 10 miles out of town, I could drive home from High School, change clothes and take our Jeep CJ2 on an evening hunt. School let out just before 3 P.M. Each day, it'd take 15 minutes to drive home, another 5-10 minutes to change clothes and I'd have about 2 hours to hunt.  Living in the area for quite some time, I knew the best areas of “jumping” a buck deer from his bedding area, and as I was hunting alone, I'd try to get an area where I could get a clear shot if I did indeed jump a buck from his bed.  This afternoon I drove directly to the north side of Gray Butte (southern Jefferson County,Oregon) and up a “Jeep road” that went about halfway up the sharp little butte, (Grey Butte) I parked the Jeep which had no top and the windshield was in the down position, typical of military built Jeeps, so I could get a very good view of the area to the northeast. I parked in the only somewhat level area at the top (end) of the road, set the parking brake and glanced the area I was going to hunt. A “glint” or reflection of light caught my eye from a northerly position. I didn't give it much thought as we lived in an area surrounded by small, local airports, and it was a very common sight to see small aircraft on any given day. I was about to get out and start my walk (hunt) when the thought occurred to me that I could not hear the engine of what I thought was a small airplane, yet it was only about half a mile away. As it was a calm, clear day, with no clouds, I took a rest and looked through the 4X scope of my rifle at what I was sure would be a small plane. Wrong! The craft had NO WINGS, NO VISIBLE TAIL, NO WINDOWS, NO EXHAUST, NO MARKINGS........AND NO SOUND! I immediately shook my head (in case I was having dilutions or ?) I looked again. The craft continued at what I estimated was 65-80 mph, about the same speed as a small single engine airplane would be cruising. I thought I was hallucinating! I looked at my watch....4:35 P.M. Broad daylight. Yet, what I was seeing was not what I was believing! The craft never deviated from the steady cruising speed that I likened to a small planes speed. I watched until I could no longer see the craft through my scope, as it continued southward. It took about 10 minutes for this entire episode to pass. I would estimate the craft was 30-40 feet long. I think it was about ½ mile overhead and a slight bit to the east. It was over 10 years before I mentioned this to my parents. I thought they'd think I was drinking. To my surprise, they actually believed what I told them. It was too bad I was alone on that butte. I would have appreciated a witness!  P.S. In this account, we were living in the same place as in account #1, southern Jefferson County, Oregon, with a Culver, Oregon mailing address. A secondary note: I NEVER was a drinker. Neither of my folks were drinkers. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

During the late summer of 1964 or 1965, my girlfriend and I were on a hilltop in central Oregon doing a little star-gazing. As my car was a hardtop, I was outside leaning on the car where I could get a better view of the cloudless evening sky. It was after 9:30 P.M.,  a warm, calm evening. After a few minutes when my eyes had adjusted to the light-less area and my headlights had been off long enough to allow me to see well, I noticed what could best be described as the red clearance light (strobe)of a commercial airliner overhead and to the east. Then I began to notice several other “red-lights” in close proximity to the first one. Upon closer scrutiny I noticed there was about a dozen small, red lights. It looked like they were in pairs. They would spiral what seemed to be upward, then tumble over each other in a downward free-fall, then level off, and repeat the maneuver. ALL of them were doing this. Both my girlfriend and I were dumbfounded, to say t! he least! We continued watching these lights for over an hour. (Please keep in mind neither one of us were “drinkers”, and definitely NOT pot users.) As my friend needed to be back home before 11:00 P.M., we headed the five miles to her house. At her residence, I borrowed her dad's single-lens spotting scope and returned to the area to see if the lights were still in the Easterly sky. Sure enough! Still there. Still doing the same pairs of red-light spirals as before. (I believe the mono-lens was about a 4X ) Even with the lens they were obviously quite a distance from me. They were obviously CLOSER, but by no means were any additional details to be seen. I continued to view these “pairs of red lights” until about 2:00 A.M. And went home. When I arrived at my home, about 5 miles North of where I'd been watching the show, the yard lights were so bright I couldn't see what I had been observing earlier. Next morning I listened for any reports of lights.....but heard of none. A! gain, I didn't mention much to anyone except my girlfriend, wh! o appear ed to think we were having a wild dream of some type. (This was the first time I noticed she would tend to deny something existed if she didn't have an easy to understand explanation for a given event.) One other note: we/I never heard any type of sound(s) from either viewing. However, it can be difficult to hear a jet-liner if it is at 35,000 feet or higher and at some distance away (not directly  overhead). But red lights, in tandem, “playing”......NOT a commercial plane!  P.S. We were still residing at the same farm/ ranch in Jefferson County, Oregon. The actual “red light” sightings took place in an area called Lone Pine, Oregon about 5 miles east of Terrebonne, Oregon.

The time is late fall, 1967.  The girlfriend mentioned in #3 is my wife and we live in Bend, Oregon where I was attending college.  As finances were tight (nothing new for a student) we would many times drive to where my parents were living in Lakeview, Oregon for a weekend getaway at very little cost, other than fuel. The drive is about 175 miles to the southeast of Bend, Oregon on a two-lane asphalt highway, and for the most part extremely barren and traveled very little after dark. I had classes at Central Oregon Community College until late afternoons and we'd leave Bend about dark for the approximately 3 hour drive. About halfway through the trip, near Silver Lake, Oregon, which is noted for the long, flat expanses of arid dry desert, I got a chill, as if I was being watched. Since we were in somewhat desolate country with the possibility of deer, cattle or horses using the open rangeland, I kept my driving speeds to between 50 and 55 mph so I could stop if said animals decided to use the road to lie down and take a snooze. As we were driving I noticed a small light at the 1:00 o'clock position and roughly 40 degrees up. Okay, it could be the landing light of any small airplane that the pilot forgot to turn off. Suddenly the light started getting larger, which at this point I decreased my driving speed so as not to drive off the road while watching the light continue to get even larger. As the light got larger I slowed even more until I'm almost stopped. Keep in mind that stopping in the road in this area isn't dangerous as we hadn't seen a car for over an hour. The light has grown to a size that I estimated to be about 100 feet in diameter and at a distance of 1-2 miles away. It looked huge. My wife is screaming at me to “get going”. No way....I want to see this thing! Then it starts getting smaller, until it is back to the original size, turns to a flashing red light, starts moving west, and within a count of 1,2,3....it is over the horizon! And in this flat, open range, that is over 20 miles! GONE....in a couple of seconds! I'm excited. I was delighted to see something like this. My wife is still cussing at me (which is rare for her to use profanity) but she is scared! We continued the rest of the trip with no more “excitement”. She didn't say one word to me for the rest of the trip! We arrive at my parents house, she goes directly to bed without speaking to me.....!!! The next morning, she acts as if this didn't occur! She would NOT admit what we saw! I've tried to reason in my mind what we saw. I know that one of the strobe lights on all airplanes is red. Fine! But that doesn't explain the white light.....growing to a gigantic size.......reducing again to a small white light than to a flashing red light and DISAPPEARING OVER THE HORIZON in a flash! Needless to say, I never heard of any sightings that evening. Even if anyone else in the area had seen it they'd be accused of drinking! I guess this is the reason it took so many years for me to mention any sightings to anyone. I KNOW WHAT I WITNESSED! Can't explain it, but know what I saw!!!

As it moved from east to west, it took a perfect ""L""-shaped turn south towards my neighborhood.  I was next door and ran home and my mom and aunt ( who still lives there and is nearly 80 yrs old), were standing outside and several other neighbors and kids were looking up at this light and were stunned at its appearance.  The object flew literally above our neighborhood at maybe 2000 feet high at which time it stopped and turned into a large disk whose ""underbelly"" started to create a spinning white-bluish light in several perfect puls! es until the end, when it shot a greenish odd light that spun in an almost octagonal shape ( what haunts me most, as that color and light were not from Earth), and then disappeared without a trace leaving a greenish cloud or ""smoke"" in its place. It made no noise whatsoever.  My mom and I still talk about it and my son makes fun of my story, but to this day, I think about this incident almost daily as I cannot compare this to any thing else I have experienced.   I have never shared this story before, other than family members but saw similarities to events posted in October 1969 on this site.

My mother was going to bed when something drew her attention to the window. She looked out and across from our house, above the treeline she noticed something strange so she called out to me to have a look. I had a friend over and we both looked out the window as she pointed out a stationary light above the trees on the mountain across from our house.  To me it just looked like a star, perhaps just a little bigger or brighter than an average star, but just a star. She told us that the light had been moving and it had flashed different colors. I think she said it had changed to red and blue.  But it was just a normal white star color and stationary when my friend and I saw it. We went out onto our porch to get a better look, but it still just looked like a normal star and it wasn't moving.  Further, there was no sound. Well, that's not true.  There was the normal sound of a clear, windless summer night in south-eastern Kentucky: a million frogs and insects, but that was a prime indicator of normalcy. If there actually was silence, it was time to get scared. Just as we we about to go back to whatever we were doing previously, the ""star"" started slowly moving to the left and my mom gave me that ""told you so"" look. I can't tell you how far it moved, since I don't really know how far away it was, but as a guess, if the object was directly over the trees across from us, at least 100 feet.  Then it just stopped again. When it moved, it moved slowly, silently and perfectly horizontally without any vertical motion.  There was no inertia to its motion when it started moving or when it stopped. At this point I distinctly got the feeling we were being watched and I suggested we go back inside (a fact my mom brought up every time she recounted the story over following decades). From inside the house, we watched the light for a few more minutes and then it slowly descended out of sight (or flew directly away from our house which I think would have looked the same). I never saw any other colors of light than white, but I believe my mom did. I don't think that the object I saw would have ever caught her attention otherwise as she always had sheer curtains over her windows.

The max video time limit on my phone was like 1 minute something. We get back to the camp later that night and i start watching the videos when i noticed something strange. (Keep in mind that no one saw anything in the sky even E who was riding on the car  Although he appears to notice it in the video)   At the very beginning of the video i point the camera towards the road to show how fast we are going and you can see a bright neon green light in the distance on the left side of the road. I point the camera back to E on the car, then back towards the road and the green light is now a cigar shape and is much closer.  It's on the right side of the road and is bigger and brighter. If you stop the video about 5 seconds in you can see the reflection on The car and it looks like three green lights. All of the people who were there will testify that I did not tamper with this video in any way. And this is not a joke or a hoax. Im not saying it was an alien space ship, but i cant identify this strange light.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,33.4843,-92.4952

After the fireworks everyone started clearing out and we let our 8 year old son play one more game that was still running before leaving.  We drove to the bottom of the hill to get gas, about ½ mile away and on our way back up the hill we could see this large red ball of light above the field that we had just left.  It was about 10:20 pm.  We pulled off of the road in the store parking lot and watched this object hover for about 3-4 minutes, never moving and not making a sound.  It slowly started moving away getting smaller and it disappeared then reappeared and disappeared again.  The moon was full and off to the right.  The total time it was in view was approximately 6-7 minutes.  We watched the sky the rest of the way home, about 7 miles, but never saw it appear again. My son was a little freaked out but we told him it was just a light and there was nothing to worry about. On Friday, August 17th at about 10:30 pm I went out on my front porch to smoke and my son and dog followed me out the door.  I tied the dog and looked up and noticed this Large red object coming over the trees and said, “What the H*** is that?”  My son said, “It looks like a helicopter.”  It was the shape of a helicopter with the front end on the left, rounded and completely glowing red and what would have been the tail end on the left, a straight line of red to the right.  It was not a helicopter.  It was coming toward our house in that direction, sideways.  It made no sound at all and was fairly low to the ground.  I told my son to go get his dad.  It came about 150 yards toward me and then totally disappeared before reaching my house.  My son came back out to tell me his dad wasn’t coming out.  He asked me where it went and I told him it was gone.  He looked towards the woods straight across from my house and said, “What is that?”  It looked like a white dome descending o! ver the trees.  The he yelled, “Look mom, there are two more!”  Coming from the exact same location as the first one, two red balls of light came over the trees and continued in a path over the house until they were out of site.  My husband finally came out to see what the commotion was only to see the tail end of the lights which were quite small at this time.  My son is crying at this time and a little hysterical.  My husband told him they were airplanes and I told him if it was something scary, I surly wouldn’t be standing outside watching them and looking for more.  At this point my husband is trying to convince me that I’m seeing airplanes.  I know what an airplane looks like and these most certainly were NOT airplanes.  August 21st, about 1:30 am.  My husband got out of bed to take the dog out and straight ahead of my porch were 2 glowing red balls.  He said he watched them for a few minutes just hover there and then slowly get smaller until they disappeared.  He did not inform of this until this afternoon but told me they most definitely were not airplanes he was looking at.  I found this site on the computer and see that there was another witness to the 2 fireballs on Friday night from Conway, which is about 8 miles from me so I thought I would put up a post also.  I’m curious to know if the timeframe was similar, although they did not report the helicopter shaped object.  The 2 fireballs came about 3 minutes after the 1st one.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,,

On this particular afternoon I was operating the Beechcraft Kingair 200 on a flight from Southwestern France to my destination of Frankfurt, Germany.  I was flying at an altitude of 27,000 feet. At approximately 14:00 Central European Time, I noticed the other pilot bending his neck in an upward position and gazing out the cockpit window.  The sky was clear and it was a beautiful day.  He said, “that’s another airplane up above us, right?”  I looked up and I did see another jet approximately 8,000 feet above our position leaving a distinct contrail as it flew overhead in a westerly direction.  I said, “ya, it’s beautiful, huh?”  He replied, “ok…but what in the world is that”, while pointing at an object that appeared to be well above the jet we just saw fly above our position. The strange object in question must have been at an altitude of at least 25,000 feet above the aircraft we just saw.  So, that would mean the object was at a possible altitude of 60,000 feet. Commercial aircraft cruise in the mid to high 30,000 ft range.  Some corporate jets like the Gulfstream V can cruise in the high 40,000 foot range.  I don’t know of any current operating aircraft operating at an extremely high altitude like the 60,000 ft range. The object was a perfect circle.  It was not a disc, not saucer shaped, but a geometrically perfect circle.  The color was silver.  There were no lights on it. To me, there appeared to be some type of aura or haze around the circle. It was motionless.  We only lost sight of the object because we flew underneath it. My reaction is to say it was a weather balloon.  However, I have never seen a weather balloon, so I can not be confident in making such a statement.   I would say its mass would have to be similar to the size of a B737. The event was witnessed by myself, the co-pilot and our passenger.  We joked about it, but afterwards I had a bit of an uneasy feeling due to the fact that I was unable to identify the object we all encountered.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,,

I believe it was July or August. One evening after the training day I and two or three other members of my crew were sitting on the bench outside of the firehouse just relaxing and shooting the breeze.  The bench faced west and we could see the hills of Heidelberg in the distance.  It wasn’t quite dusk yet but the sun was low enough that it didn’t affect our vision. Just across the street from our location was the installation post office, a low, flat, one-story with two large oak trees planted in front on either side of the entrance. So as I said, we were sitting on the bench gazing off to the west towards Heidelberg when I noticed an aircraft traveling north to south at an unusually high rate of speed.  To quantify that, what it looked like was a large aircraft with its landing lights on as it makes its final approach from about ten miles out.  The luminosity was enough to attract my attention but we could only distinguish the light.  And as it was traveling north to south we could tell that it was traveling much faster than any aircraft we had ever seen. We were watching this ""light"" in amazement as it seared across the sky wondering what it could be.  Our view of it was obscured for a few seconds as it passed behind the foliage of the oak tree on the left.  It reappeared, and as it was halfway between the two trees it made a 90-degree turn straight up and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We walked through the woods to Walker's Pond and the inlet where we were going to fish. I carried a large cell flashlight, like an electric linesman would use. It was dark enough to need the light to watch your step along the path. There were other fishermen were positioned around the pond, we could faintly hear them talking and occasionally see their flashlights, but we were the only people fishing on the other end of the pond. As we approached the waters edge, I noticed flashing, colored lights off to my right. I said out loud, ""What the hell is that?"", my friend said ""I don't know."" The other fishermen were too far away and from their angle could not see into the small cove where the lights were. We watched it for about a minute when I decided to blink the flashlight at it. Suddenly the lights began moving silently toward us, hovering just above the water. I could plainly see it was a saucer shaped craft, approx. 70 to 100 ft. wide, there was a dome-like bubble on top. The lights were going around the edge under the craft, yellow, red and white. I thought I could see shadows in the dome part. I was freaked out and said to my friend let's get out of here! He agreed, we were standing right beside each other as we turned to run. I took about 3-4 steps and fell down. I immediately got back on my feet and called to my friend, silence. He didn't answer, which I found very odd since he had been within 5 ft. of me not 30 secs. before. I called again and he answered me from about 100 yds. away. He made his way back and asked what happened. I was confused and didn't know what had taken place. As we regrouped to make our way out of the woods, we suddenly realized all the fishermen on the pond were gone. There was no one fishing, they had all left.Normally fishermen would be there until 2 am. My friend and I cannot account for the time that we lost that evening. We don't know if we were abducted, but somehow a period of time is unaccounted for from that night. I'm a 59 yrs old male, ex-Marine, not given to hallucinations or visions. This experience has stayed with me my entire life and have wanted to be hypnotized or regressed to find out about that night but haven't actually done it. My friend who also witnessed this, died about 15 yrs. later. I will tell you this, after my experience, I KNOW Ufo's are real and I believe others who tell their stories. I recently learned about the Allagash Abductions and was very interested because that group of abductees also flashed their light to attract the saucer. Their event also took place in the 70's. We both signaled the saucer with a blinking light! Weird! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2012-08-05T00:00:00,44.3667,-68.7454

A few minutes after that another similar object was seen crossing the sky, but from a much different direction.  When it was almost directly overhead, it came to a sudden stop.  We tried to keep an eye on it, which was difficult in a sky full of stars.   It wasn't long before we noticed yet another similar object approaching from approx t! he same direction, but this one headed straight for the object that appeared stationary, then proceeded to ""bounce"" off the object at about a 120 degree angle and keep right on going, without speeding up or slowing down.   The stationary object never moved again, or at least it didn't before we all fell asleep.  We all talked about it the next couple of days and we all agreed we had seen UFO's.   Note: all of the ""UFOs"" we saw that evening were about the same size and brightmess and moving at a similar rate of speed.

"A large, glowing ball that changed colors, and drifted overhead and to the South and West of me.",McDermott,NV,1975-10-20T01:30:00,sphere,3 hours,"Occurred : 10/20/1975 01:30  (Entered as : 10/20/75 1:30) Reported: 7/25/2012 7:09:35 PM 19:09 Posted: 8/5/2012 Location: McDermott, NV Shape: Sphere Duration:3 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91181.html,"A large, glowing ball that changed colors, and drifted overhead and to the South and West of me. #5.   McDermitt, Nevada Glow.  In 1975 my folks and I were in the Lapidary trade (commercial rock-hounds) digging about 10 miles west of McDermitt, Nevada, on the Disaster Peak Road, which is heading due west from McDermitt, Nevada, on the way to the Trout Creek Mountains.  We had a pick-up camper set up off the pickup as living quarters.  I would go home to Sweet Home, Oregon every other week to see my boys. (My divorce had decreed I could get my two sons every other weekend.) On the week--ends between, I'd go shopping on Sunday in Winnemucca, Nevada, for what supplies and food we would use while mining at that location.   For some reason my parents needed to go out for one of the week-ends and I stayed alone at the digging pit.  Our location was high on a desert plateau, almost always a wind, very dry, but the elevation seemed to negate the heat, so it wasn't an unpleasant spot.  In the evenings it was difficult to get a good radio signal and television was out of the question. I would usually listen to KBOI, an AM frequency from Boise, Idaho.  Many nights I'd fall asleep with the radio still playing and wake up to a bunch of stati cas it was not great reception on a constant basis.  Then I'd turn off the radio and go back to sleep.   This particular evening I woke up to static.....no big deal, figured I'd forgot to turn the radio off as I would do quite often.  Surprise......when I went to turn the radio off, IT WAS OFF!   Okay, I figured I was still groggy from waking up.  I got out of bed, splashed my eyes with water just to be sure I wasn't having a dream.  At that time I noticed it was very light outside.  The amount of light outside seemed extra-ordinarily bright even if it was a full moon (which it was).  I opened the camper door, which faced to the west and noticed the full moon, okay, but also another glow coming from the small amount of clouds to the west.   However, this glow was larger than the moon, which I could see easily, and was a shimmering yellow, white, silver, pink and kept changing colors as I watched it.  My jaw must have been gaping in disbelief!  As I watched, it would slowly move west, then south, then north......not quickly, but always in motion. It would drif! t out of the clouds, then into the clouds.  It was brighter than the full moon and constantly changing colors. (Pastel colors, not vivid colors.)  To say I was scared would be a bit of an understatement.  I went back inside the camper and got dressed. In the excitement it didn't take long to dress!   I continued to watch this object for over an hour. The noise that I had initially thought to be the radio was coming from this object. Not loud, but always present.  My best estimate of size would depend on the distance I thought it to be away from me. I estimate the object at 300-400 feet in diameter, and 5-8 miles away, maybe more.  I finally thought to look at the time.....4:10 A.M. So I must have awakened about 3:00 A.M.  It slowly drifted west over the Trout Creek Mountains out of view. Needless to say, I did NOT go back to sleep!  I turned on KBOI radio at about 6:00 A.M. Later that morning to the news of a sighting by several others within a couple hundred mile radius.  A Nevada State Trooper witnessed what I saw while he was patrolling between McDermitt and Winnemucca, Nevada, (actually he was near Orovada, Nevada at the time).  An Idaho State Trooper near Murphy, Idaho also reported seeing a large glowing object.  A mother and daughter driving toward Boise, Idaho from McDermitt also saw and reported the object.   One of the most interesting sightings, in my opinion, came from a man living near Boise. The man owned a private airplane, drove to the airport, started his plane and tried to get nearer the object, however, the object disappeared before he could get very far from the airport where he had departed.    When my parents returned on Monday, the news had gotten to them before I had the opportunity to share my experience about it. We did spend a lot of time discussing it.  They were so disappointed they had gone back home and had missed the event.  I was so pleased to know others had witnessed this object.  The variety of witnesses was incredible.  It made news chatter for about a week and then faded out. Again.......I know what I saw, and as I've stated before.....I DON'T DRINK nor do I ENGAGE IN DRUGS !!!

Why do I know that all this that follows was not simply a dream?  It didn't feel like a dream, I felt I was awake but out of normal condition.  Consider this, in a dream state I seem to accept everything that happens no matter how bizarre as 'real' but in this incident and all during it I was continually rejecting it, thinking that ""this was impossible, this can't be happening,"" and as each level unfolded I continued to be confounded at the content. In short,  I could evaluate which is a higher order of thinking that is beyond dream awareness. Anyway, the impossibility got worse as I am somehow transported (floated) up to a classic silver flying saucer! I clearly remember seeing the hull out of the dark, where the two ends converge and I am absolutely stunned, thinking, what the?  This can't be happening!  That is a flying saucer!  This thing was parked above our house in the dark but I could see it in the dark. And at the next instant I am inside! I see what appears to be a human military man American, I presume, I don't know the words he is saying but I sense his anger, this man is extremely angry about something.  I later believe that he was possibly mad that I am awake because I may have said something to him or he could see my eyes were open!  I am aware of other human beings United States Military men on board.  I don't seem to be walking or I can't feel my legs.  I am transported into the center of the craft and put on a table on my back and doctors surround me and immediately commence brain surgery!  My mind seems to be cracked open and I am seemingly transported to another area, larger space and I feel at this time very afraid as it has gone from impossible to unfathomable and I am simply overwhelmed and feel as if I am a whimpering thought of ""bodylessness"" (a ghost of some kind)!  This operation seems I can hear others conversing but the words are not understandable,! but I can sense their communication amongst themselves. This is the longest period of time and is fuzzy as to details. After some time I seem to lose all consciousness and after more time I wake up in my bed the next morning. The sun is shining and I begin another day at work! But I have immediate recall of the above and I am simply befuddled as to how to understand it. I was shocked by it all! It all had a very real unreal feeling about it but I could not be sure. For the next 30 years or so I would never discuss this with a single soul. I was too scared to admit it for anyone would think I was nuts! The book Communion had a line that solidified for me that it may indeed be real with the line ""...and they implanted something in my brain..."" after that I was a wreak for the next year or so trying to accept its reality. Finally after 5 or 10 years and then seeing the culture start to talk about this kind of thing (the Simpsons had scenes of people being abducted u! p into space ships and more people started coming out with sim! ilar sto ries) then I started to lighten up about it. Now I can freely discuss it without too much distress.  Some interesting points: The album cover by Emerson Lake and Palmer really keyed me in at the time: ""Brain Salad Surgery"" that painting depicted very well what I felt was similar to the experience in some form. There was a robotic feeling about it.  The man in the ship, I later saw a photo of General Curtis Lemay and I swear the fellow on board looked so much like that man that I think it was him!  At that time (1975) there had not been any reports of anything like this happening to people, being sucked up into a flying saucer! Surgery?! So I was not influenced by anything from the culture, this was totally new and totally unexpected.  I was apparently unharmed. Just a bit freaked out as we say! No physical evidence was noted on myself, I didn't even look for any.  That is about it, I wanted to report it officially somewhere so it can go into the record. I don't seem to have any recollection of anything like this happening to me before or since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I worked in the Natural Resources Division as a crewmember on the unit’s Fire Truck.  On the night in question we were tasked to lend support to the U.S. Forest Service in conducting a controlled burn on a unit of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The mission probably began around 1930 PDT.  The firemen walked their drip torches from the top of the clear-cut block to the bottom and spent the rest of the evening making sure the fire did not jump the lines. Between 2200 -2230 PDT the fires were dying down and the crews were assembled on the landing, which overlooked a steep canyon, shooting the breeze while the bosses decided who would stay on site that night to monitor the fire. It was about this time that someone noticed ""an aircraft"" approaching from the north.  I call it an aircraft because it was traveling through the air, but that’s where its similarity to anything else I have ever seen ended.  It caught the first person’s attention because there appeared to be flames and sparks emanating from it.  There were probably a dozen guys on the ground there and we all watched it in amazement.  It was just a cylindrical object travelling a slow, horizontal path with perhaps a 3-degree downward trajectory.  There were no wings, no elevators and no rudder.  There was probably a moon, I don’t know, but some light was shed on it from the fires behind us. The best way to describe it is that it kind of resembled a booster rocket but it was travelling horizontally and about one-third as fast as an airliner on its final approach. As it passed the only sound I detected was a hissing and crackling.  A plume of smoke seemed to be coming from the middle of it with hints of sparks and flames.  There seemed to be markings but I could not make them out.   Now the smoke was the other curious thing. Because the thing was travelling so slowly it seemed to drift out or off of the object.  The affect was similar to holding a lighted cigarette horizontally and tracing a line in the air with it. We all stood and watched it until it disappeared out of sight behind the next ridge.  We kind of listened for an explosion or a crash, but there was none. I listened and watched for news on the radio, television and newspaper for anything that might give a hint as to what it was.  And if it crashed in the woods in would probably start a major fire that a lot of units would have to roll on.   But there were no big fires and to this day I have never heard anything about it or even like it.  I have no idea what it was.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,40.611439423076924,-122.35183557692308

It was October 1 or 15, 1981, as best we can tell because weather records indicate October 8 was too cold.  It was early on a Thursday evening and we were on our way from Morehead to a bar in Mt. Sterling with high hopes of getting the weekend started early since I had no classes the next day.  At least that's how it all began that day, as normal as any other day.  By dark things were anything but normal. When the car topped the little rise on the four lane we saw it in the distance.  It was sitting there in mid air, perfectly still and amazingly silent.  My first thought is that from this angle and distance I could understand how one of these things could be described as cigar shaped.  That description would be totally inaccurate since it was the classic flying saucer shaped craft.  Instantly I realized the impression of a cigar shape is just an optical illusion from certain vantage points.  My friend later said there was a triangular shape to the structure on top but I was driving and never really got a good look from an angle where I could see the upper portion of the craft.  As we got closer the size of it nearly took my breath away and that eerie lack of engine noise really sank in even though it was hovering motionless at rooftop height or maybe a little higher. It was enormous with full running lights ablaze.  The machining was obvious, the airliner shaped windows were evenly spaced metallic depressions, and it was so close to the highway it felt like we were about to drive under it.  I’ve never known exactly how big it was, a hundred feet across is just a guess because it could have been a hundred and twenty five or fifty feet easily.  The lights were fairly evenly spaced and mostly white, with a scattering of red and amber.  There may have been some green lights as well, but it wasn’t the lights that held my attention.  It was the whole thing in its entirety and it was a wondrous sight. I slowed the car and began to pull off the road onto the shoulder.  I knew two things with great certainty.  I wanted so badly to see it and somebody was granting my request.  I also knew without any doubt this was a rare opportunity and I would never get this chance again.  I had no idea how I knew these things, but it didn’t matter in the moment.  All I wanted was to pull over and get out so I could get a better look. That’s when my best friend, speechless until we were nearly stopped, yelled for me to hit the gas.  There was such urgency in her voice that I immediately did as she asked, convinced she had seen something I hadn’t noticed and that it scared her.  It was only recently we began to discuss it again after years of trying to put it out of our minds.  She told me the second before she yelled out she became aware of a beam of light the craft had suddenly focused on us, something I hadn’t been conscious of although I do remember everything being lit up nearly bright as day.  All I knew was that as we pulled away it was obvious she felt we needed to be far away from this thing, whatever it was.  In the moment I reluctantly bowed to her wishes without knowing exactly why, but with a measure of silent regret for what I’d never get to see. Neither of us knew how we got here or how long it had been dark outside.  Further discussion revealed we both remembered the same thing, getting back on the interstate after buying soft drinks at the second Bath County exit and driving west towards the setting sun.  As we got back on the interstate for the short drive we knew we only had another twelve or fourteen miles to go to get off at the next exit in the neighboring county.  Somehow we missed both exits for Mt. Sterling because the next thing we were aware of it was dark and it felt like we weren’t in the right place. We nervously tried to laugh it off.  The nearly total darkness of the rural country side seemed to press in on us.  There was no other choice but find a place to turn around.  We drove to the next exit, which was the first Clark County exit.  There was nothing within sight there except pasture.  There were no street lights or houses, not even the obligatory gas station visible in the distance one would expect to find near an exit ramp off an interstate highway.  We wasted no time in turning around and getting back on the interstate, this time on the eastbound side. We were still wondering how we had over shot our destination so badly as we pulled back onto the deserted highway.  It was such an implausible explanation that we had somehow passed not one, but both Mt. Sterling exits and missed the sunset we were driving towards that our laughter held a hollow ring.  We were uncomfortably aware we were headed back into Montgomery County, a county we had absolutely no memory of having just driven through.  It was pretty weird but not half as weird as what was about to happen.  A couple of minutes later we topped that little rise on the four lane and the saucer shaped craft came into sight. After my friend yelled for me to hit the gas I did pull back onto the interstate and accelerate, watching the saucer grow smaller in my rearview mirror as we increased our distance from it.  It never did move.  We kept driving eastward.  The saucer remained there.  It just hovered silently exactly where it was until it faded from our sight.  When we were far enough away that it was entirely out of our sight we were suddenly able to talk again as if a spell had been released.  My friend convinced me not to tell anybody, that there was no point since nobody would ever believe us anyway. She was right about that because I don’t think anybody ever has believed us, not that we ever told many people.  There’s that and the fact that it lacked some of the exciting elements of a classic saucer sighting like the impossibly quick maneuvers commonly reported.  The one we saw didn’t do anything but it was a lot closer to us than with most reported sightings.  The other thing is even though it was stationary and we got a very good look at it, we saw none of the occupants so they could as easily been Russian or Chinese as little green or grey men from another world. Over the years it occurred to me it could be one of our experimental aircrafts before so much time passed.  After twenty years or so when our military never introduced a fleet of flying saucers with some new propulsion system that no longer relied on noisy jet engines I gave up on that theory.  The fact that the Russians and Chinese also failed to incorporate any radical changes in their aircrafts during that period pretty much nixed the idea that it was foreign technology from this planet.  I gave up those explanations over a decade ago when nobody on earth stepped up with this radical advancement or reaped the benefits of a viable alternative engine design with the assumed alternate fuel source that would power such a thing. As time passed it just seemed more and more unlikely that two or three decades would come and go without some sign of these discoveries leaching into the world market, but to this day it never has.  In the last decade or so that left just one possibility to contemplate.  It became more and more reasonable to accept the saucer wasn’t from this planet at all.  In accepting that probability I’m left with exploring the knowledge I began with, the things I was sure of the moment I saw it come into sight.  At that second it never occurred to me the thing might be native to my own planet.  It was only later my mind reached for a logical way to explain what we saw without stating the outlandish. In time the event defied all other explanations.  It was obviously extraterrestrial as much as I might have fought saying it out loud.  All that was left was those first few thoughts that had been so crystal clear and in the second it came into view I never had any doubt that it was an alien craft.  I also knew from the very core of my being its sole purpose for being there beside the highway, completely still and displayed in all its glory with every running light ablaze, was to let us see it.  I can’t explain why, but I was utterly without fear and knew this was my one and only chance to see it.  I was certain it would never return and in this lifetime I would never get another opportunity.  Thirty-one years later I can tell you that so far as I know that’s still true.  I’ve never seen anything even remotely questionable in the sky since that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

"Procession of very large, multi-coloured craft.",Ottawa,ON,1988-08-14T23:00:00,sphere,5 hours,"Occurred : 8/14/1988 23:00  (Entered as : 08/14/88 23:00) Reported: 7/31/2012 8:39:03 AM 08:39 Posted: 8/5/2012 Location: Ottawa (west of) (Canada), ON Shape: Sphere Duration:5 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91340.html,"Procession of very large, multi-coloured craft. The reason I am finally taking the time to submit my story is because I heard your recent interview on the Jeff Rense programme where you shared some recent sightings that sound so incredibly similar to the remarkable one I had many years ago.  It happened in 1989, about 80 km west of Ottawa ON. It was a calm, clear summer night and the stars were numerous. As I was enthralled with astronomy at the time, I was on the roof of our cottage with a friend and a set of binoculars, and I was teaching her the basic summer constellations. My parents were inside the cottage and they had two sets of friends visiting as well. I noticed that across the eastern shoreline (about a mile across), there was a red light that was moving erratically in the sky, some distance away. It was perhaps the size and brightness of the star Deneb. I found it strange, so I focused the binoculars on them. Although it was tough to keep them still, I followed this red light zigzagging up and down, left and right. It was moving very fast and then coming to a complete stop. At times it would disappear below the treeline, and then pop back up into the sky. I didn’t say a word to my friend, as I wanted to make sure what I was seeing was really what I thought I was seeing. As I had been so focused on the one red light, I didn’t notice when a second and a third joined it, along the dark treeline horizon. Now there were three of them, all the same size and colour, zigzagging up and down and left and right and disappearing below the treeline and popping back. I went through the checklist of what they could be - weather balloon! s (just plain no), search lights (no clouds), helicopters (no sound), planes (can’t move this way)…and realized that what I had been watching for quite a few minutes were truly unidentifiable, to the best of my knowledge.  I told my friend to take a look, and she too saw the three red lights. I stood up, banged on the roof, and called down to my parents to come outside and see. As it was such a still night, I am sure the whole lake must have heard me. We came off the roof and met my parents and their friends on the porch. Ironically, the moment they came outside, the red lights dipped below the horizon and disappeared. They didn’t see a thing. What are the odds! My parents were extremely skeptical and were certain the red lights were weather balloons.  At this point, 5 of the 6 adults went to bed. I estimate it was around 11pm. One of my parents friends, though, came to me quietly and asked me to describe to him, more privately, what we had seen. He was a retired RCAF pilot, with many hours of service under his belt, and was presently the principal of an elementary school in Ontario. We told him what we saw and he was extremely interested in our story. He asked us to show him the direction of where we saw the lights. So, the three of us (my friend, my dad’s friend, and myself) went down to our dock and watched the eastern horizon, above the treeline, with eager attention.  We had retrieved a second pair of binoculars. After about 15 minutes and no more red lights, we were thinking that our light show was over.  As we had been staring so intently on the eastern shore of the lake, we hadn’t noticed an ENORMOUSLY lit craft to our right, above the southern side of the bay we are situated in.  To say we were instantly startled and shocked is an understatement. The southern shore from our dock is about 400 meters away.  The treeline extends maybe 90-100 feet above the lake, with a small hill. I estimated that this craft was not much farther beyond the shoreline…perhaps another half kilometer, maximum.  It was also approximately the width of my four fingers above the treeline horizon (I am actually sitting on our dock, where we saw these crafts, writing this). Now, the size of this craft was around the size of a tennis ball.  It was enormous. Looking at it through the binoculars, you couldn’t see the whole craft…only parts of it.  It was moving from west to east, and very slowly.  And it wasn’t making a sound…it was completely silent.  I remember hearing people across the lake laughing and partying while we were watching it, and I wondered if they were seeing it too.  The next day I learned no one had. The craft was shaped like a Big Mac (that was my comparison at the time).  It was rounded, but not fully circular.  There were no wings. There was nothing protruding out of any part of it.  All around the outside of the craft were a few dozen of individual red lights, equally spaced in an orderly fashion.   There were maybe 3 or 4 ‘rows’ of red lights. Inside the red lights were some individual green lights.  They were the same size as the red, just fewer of them.  And then, in the centre of the craft were some individual white lights. Again, the same size and brightness of the others…just white.  The reds were the most predominant.  The lights did not flash. The three of us must have watched this craft cross the lake for about 15 minutes.  All of a sudden, another craft, exactly like the one we were watching, appeared in the same place as the first.  Same distance above the horizon, same speed, same lights, same silence…moving west to east. It followed the same path as the first.  Over the next couple of hours, the three of us sat on our dock and witnessed 6 of these huge crafts pass by us, all following each other a similar distance, all looking exactly like each other…..all passing the eastern shore at the same place and continuing east.  We realized that once they had travelled eastward some distance past the lake they looked like the red lights we had originally seen on the roof of our cottage!  The green and white lights became invisible and the red lights appeared as one solitary light. At the end of this procession of craft, we saw two smaller crafts. They were maybe the size of a dime, and like a cheeseburger in shape (again, my younger mind comparison).  It was moving along the same path as the others, yet it was travelling faster, maybe 3-4 times the speed.  It appeared a similar distance above the treeline. The entire craft pulsated a lime-green colour.  In between flashes you could clearly make out the smooth disc shape of the object.  There were no wings.  There was no noise.  Before they reached the eastern shoreline, they stopped in the sky, pulsated a few times, and then flew southward, quite quickly. We soon lost sight of them. I remember thinking that those two were like the end of the parade.  We decided that was it for us and went back into the cottage. It was 4am! We were shocked!  What felt like maybe an hour or two had been 5 hours! Why hadn’t we thought of getting a camera?  Why didn’t I wake my parents and prove to them that what we had seen earlier was real?   Why didn’t we alert our cottage neighbours, who were friends of ours?   We didn’t have the answers…and I still don’t. The next day we went to the lake lodge and I asked the folks over there ‘Hey, did you see the UFOs last night? They were right above here!’ I was certain they HAD to have seen them.  But they didn’t. We listened to the news on the radio the next day and there was no word of anything.  I was shocked. How did no one else see these things?  To this day, no one has claimed they saw what we did. My parents still see their friend who was with me from time to time, and he still brings up his recollections of this night. He still says what we saw is the ‘most incredible things he has ever witnessed’.  My other friend vowed to never talk about what we saw.  I emailed her last year, asking her if she’s ever spoken to anyone, and she didn’t respond. A bit about me: I have a degree in History and Education and I have been an elementary school teacher for 13 years.  I am a married mother of two children.  As astronomy has always been a passion of mine, I have spent many hours throughout my life observing the nighttime sky.  I have never witnessed anything close to this, before or since.  The events of this evening were burned into my minds eye, and I can recollect the images and thoughts and feelings so clearly still.  I have rarely spoken about this to anyone…only a few trusted friends over the years. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

A buddy and I were 16 years old and camping about an hour east of Houston, Tx (5 miles north our tiny home town).  This is cow country, quite rural and remote, especially back then. There were four of us, but the other two were sleeping.  It was a cloudless August night.  We were enjoying some the stars (and his Dad’s beer we stole) before bed. We were facing south toward the Gulf which is an hour’s drive from there.  I noticed an airplane drifting from Houston (west) toward Beaumont (east). I remember saying something like “that must be a military jet; it’s way up there.”  It was perfectly silent, so that made initial sense.  This area is a flight path for the Houston airports; we grew up there.  We knew what commercial jets looked like at night—and you can definitely always hear them, especially in the still of the night. My buddy said something like “it can’t be an airplane, that thing might not even be in the atmosphere it’s so high.”  It’s moving way to fast to be a plane. I suggested it must be a satellite reflecting the sun to us, but I had never seen one before.  So we’re trading ideas of what we’re looking at.  It appeared to be no lower than our upper atmosphere, but probably under the satellites.  Remember, back then there weren’t many satellites. Maybe it was 45 to 60 seconds of watching.  Then it happened. This thing did something that was simply impossible.  It bounced up and down like a graph of a Cosmic Ray; high peak to trough in a relatively short space.  In about 1 to 1.5 seconds it must of oscillated 8 to 10 times.  Then it shot back in mostly the same direction it came from, maybe at a 30 degree angle over where it just came from (the west).  The problem is, it went from a nice slow visual pace to something near the speed of light. From the moment it quit proceeding to the East, it only took about 0.5 seconds for this thing to cover (I swear we’re not crazy) many thousands of miles.  It appeared to be many, a great many, diameters of the earth. We had what I’m sure is a normal reaction to this; we both shouted at the same time “Did you see that S---T?!?!?” That woke up the other two.  They were upset and accused us of being drunk.  We had each had maybe 6 beers.  We were weekend drinkers, so not really drunk yet. The other two stuck their heads out of the tent, but weren’t interested in “our prank” until morning.  They never believed us, and I don’t blame them.  We did get very drunk after that and stayed up almost till daylight trading ideas. Since what we saw was impossible, we settled on this explanation:  We were watching a satellite that just happened to quit reflecting sun light at the exact moment a meteor just happened to flam up and streak the other way.  A handy description I’ve used is that it moved like the Star Ship Enterprise gunning it for “warp 9.”  The bouncing around we dismissed as the initial explosion of the falling star. There was a very brief trail, but never since (I’m 40 now) have I seen a falling star like that.  He and I started hunting at about 10-12 years old.  We had spent many and hour watching stars and falling stars waiting for the sun to rise.  Plus we loved to go camping.  We each must of seen 100 falling stars by the age of 16. My subconscious new it wasn’t a falling star, but my conscious mind prevailed and I remained a non-believer for 24 more years. When I realized that someone video-taped something 98% similar (I never watch UFO stuff) I went into a light case of shock as my mind considered the ramifications. I’ve picked up quite a bit of physics and theoretical physics since 16.  My guess is this thing wasn’t from outer space, it came from hyperspace (5 or more dimensions). I went from making fun of guys like you to instant belief.  Sorry I’m a quarter of a century late with this one LOL.  I hope this helps someone. Dan  P.S. I’m holding off until my Christmas visit back home to show Don the video-got to see his reaction in person! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They are stationary until just before dawn.  I have personally witnessed one raise from below to the tree line rapidly moving vertical until it was positioned close to the moon, and there it stays. Naturally I know its not by the moon but it's relation to the moon's position in the sky is strange. It isn't a star or jupiter as my friend tried to explain.  I dont know what it is and the pictures I have taken arent very good quality but they are pictures of what I am describing and feel free to check it out. I would like to know what it is.

I continued on my way marveling at what I had just seen.  I took a left on a road that runs perpendicular to the first road. About a mile up the road there is farm that spans both sides of the road, and this is where I encountered the orange/red globes again.  I pulled my car over and hopped out to get a better look, trying to figure out what I was seeing.  I watched as they headed from the Western tree line to the Eastern tree line. I could not believe what I saw next.  Between each globe was a vessel that had not been visible up until then.  The globes appeared to me to have been towing/escorting the vessels. The vessels were a reddish black and glowing along the edges, kind of like lava.  The vessels also appeared to have some sort of insignia on them. I have tried but I cannot draw the shape or the insignia well enough to do them justice.  I am not sure what became of the globes once the vessels became visible because I realized that after the first vessels appeared something large and black, separate from the vessels, was being dropped  over the trees.  The only way to describe the descending items is as black masses; there is nothing that I have encountered thus far, real or fictional, that can help me describe what the masses looked like or what they could be. The globes, vessels and masses made no sounds that were audible to my ears.  I do not recall seeing any other aircraft in the sky at the time.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,41.6822,-72.4008

To the investigators of UFO’s On November 10, 1991 my cousin and I were subject to an object that not only crossed our paths that night, but would affect both of our way of thinking for some years to come. It was 10:15 P.M.  Central Standard Time as we were traveling east on highway H and was coming back into the town of Salem, Missouri. We had just crossed the one- lane bridge that resides approximately 5 miles out of town on H highway, and made our way up and over the hill just ¼ of a mile past DD intersection. Upon topping over the hill, my cousin notices what he believes is an airplane to our far left in the cattle ranchers’ field and this object is traveling south. Upon further notice, we both realized that not only was this airplane descending, but it made absolutely NO SOUND as it made its way across the field and toward H highway in which we were traveling on. Believing that it was an airplane, we accelerated to approximately 90 miles per hour so as to pass under the plane as it crossed the highw! ay.  The object reached H highway before our car had the chance to pass under it or even get close to it, and much to our dismay the object came to a complete stop above H highway. As our car came to a screeching halt, it slid up under the object and stalled out. Sitting in the middle of the highway, my cousin and I stared up at the object, still believing that it was some sort of a helicopter, when we both noticed that the object was making no sound, it was not moving, and the unknown object hovered silently not 30 to 40 feet above us. In fear, my cousin rolled up his window and we sat silently staring up at the craft. Jerry turned to me and asked “what do you think it is?” To which by this time I realized that neither of us knew the answer to his question. The object had three lights on its underside that were extremely bright. These lights formed a triangular shape and the light source did not waver in energy, in fact, the lights were so bright that the whole highway was ! illuminated as though it was daytime. After sitting motionless! above t he highway for what I believe was approximately two minutes, the craft began to slowly move diagonal from its original route and hovered to a clearing in the open field that lay to the right of my car. The object hovered just above the tree tops, almost brushing them as it passed over them, until it had reached an opening in the field. The object stops again and then, much to our dismay, starts to turn onto its side and then slowly lower itself to the ground. So close to the ground in fact, that I could see the silhouette of the field grass as the light from the two back lights shined through them. After sitting at ground level for no longer than one minute, the object slowly left our side and made its way down the forest that rested to its immediate right. The object then leveled back out flat to the ground as it traveled and after flying about 300 yards, it ascended at a 30 degree angle. It flew up into the night sky, never to be seen again by my cousin or myself. After mu! ch deliberation, my cousin and I agreed that we had not experienced any lost time nor have we ever found any explanation for what we witnessed.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,37.5737,-91.5228

First let me say that I am sorry for waiting so long to report this “officially” as it never occurred to me to do so until today. This “event” and possible “abduction” happened while I was in the military and home on leave. I don’t recall the exact date or even the month but I do remember that it happened in 1993 and it wasn’t cold outside yet, there were still green leaves on the trees so it was in between the months of May to September. My parents lived in Lusby, Maryland at the time and I was home on leave for the weekend. They had left for the weekend to visit family and I had the house to myself.  No one was home but me. Being in the military (Navy) trained me to not need an alarm clock.  I was up by 6 a.m. every day (weekends too) without the use of ANY alarm clocks at all.  I never could sleep in even if I wanted to. I should say right now that I am relatively light sleeper and a lucid dreamer, that being said, I don’t believe that my encounter was a dream in any way.  I just wanted to mention that to show that what happened to me that night was something different than ANY lucid dream I had EVER had…  Please do not dismiss what I am about to say based on what I have admitted to.  In fact, I would like to get to the bottom of this once and for all to understand that what happened to me that night DID in fact happen.  So here’s my encounter:   I went to bed that Friday night at around 10 p.m. or 2200 hrs if you wish.  I don’t recall what time it was but at some point in the night I was roused to consciousness by what appeared to be very bright flashlight type lights being shined on my bedroom window.  They were bright enough to light my entire room.  Needless to say, I got up and went to the front door to see who it was shining those bright lights at my bedroom window.  When I opened the door I couldn’t believe what I saw…  I saw a craft, maybe 40’ in diameter that looked like a yoyo only flatter.  By that I mean it looked like two saucer shaped craft that were joined in the middle about two thirds of the way in.  The outer most edges of each half of the craft had a row of lights around them as well.  This may sound strange but I can’t remember whether the lights were multi colored or white.  The craft hung just above the tree line over the dirt road in front of the house and it was giving off the purest of white ! blue light from the bottom of the craft that fanned out beneath it.  There was also a sort of sparkle or electricity to the light. Now THIS is where it gets “different” for me.  Inside of this brilliant light was standing a tall skinny being with very long “bony” for lack of a better word, legs and arms with hands that had long bony fingers that seemed a bit out of proportion to the rest of the body.  I can’t remember if the being was clothed or not (don’t know why but I don’t).  I can tell you that it had a humanoid head with eyes that were VERY human, very thin lips and a thin almost nonexistent nose.  What also struck me odd about this being is that it had what looked like very long hair, only it was real thick, almost like dread locks but not nearly as messy…  So I am standing in my front door looking at this craft/light and being standing on the dirt road looking at ME and I am thinking to myself that I should run!  But where too?!  I don’t know where to go… I am paralyzed with fear.  I want to run so badly…  But then I hear a voice, not out loud, but IN MY HEAD!!! It says to  me, “Don’t be afraid.”  “You have no reason to be afraid.”  And all at once, I was calm.  I told myself, “I have nothing to be afraid of….”  And that was that. Just before waking up/coming to the next morning I had flash backs to when I was a child living in Fort Washington, Maryland and standing in my back yard looking up at the very same craft only this time it had what the voice in my head called  a “companion craft” with it.  All I saw of the companion craft were its lights and that the lights were in the shape of a triangle and that it moved around the main craft. (Totally unrelated to this story but possibly relevant is the fact that I also suffered from “missing time” while living there as a child)   Anyway, like I stated above, no matter what day it was, whether I had duty or it was an off day or weekend, I ALWAYS woke up at 6 a.m. NO EXCEPTIONS.  I NEVER slept in.  Except for this Saturday, I didn’t wake up this Saturday until 10:30 ish and I felt drugged.  VERY disoriented and a bit unstable (walking wise) and my nose hurt and was a bit bloody.  One nostril more so over the other. I believe it was my left nostril but I can’t recall.  I just know that when I woke up it felt like at some point I had my whole finger shoved up my nose. Now, some years later, I think it was 2003, I had a full body MRI done just out of curiosity.  No medical reason what so ever, just a company offered it as a means of early detection of heart disease or cancer.  So I paid to have the scan done.  I was shocked to be told that I have a small mass on one of my lungs (I should know which one but I don’t.)  I can get medical records of the scans though as I have had a scan done on the mass three times now to “monitor” its possible growth and it has shown no sign of change. Now, I was told by one doctor early on that they were a bit confused as this mass was not “calcified” so it should be growing in size at least slowly but since it isn’t doing anything they were not going to biopsy it so as not to provoke it…  Anyway, the most recent scan was within the past 12 months and there still has been no change in whatever is in my lung. I don’t know if the mass in my lung and the encounter I had are related but I thought I would add that in just as a side. In conclusion, I hope that my account can be of some assistance to you and maybe someone can assist me in trying to determine if this was a dream or reality.  I would have chalked it up to just a dream if it weren’t for the way I felt and the time at which I woke up Saturday, or the fact that my nose was bloody and sore. Thank you for your time.

About 11:45 on August 12th,2012 I arrived at Lake Thunderbird in Norman,OK. to watch the meteor shower.  My 2 nieces ages 20 and 18 and my 2 year old grandson were with me.  We went to Zoom Beach on Indian Point Road. We sat on a blanket at the most North point of the area.  My grandson was asleep the entire time.  All activity observed was within one half of the sky or a 180 degree area. With 0 degrees being North-80 degrees East and 180 degrees South. We were facing East but slightly North-about 70 degrees.  There was a very tall street light about 200 feet behind us-otherwise it was very dark.  Aprox. 12:15 my niece witnessed a firey orange triangle appear above the treeline across the lake at about 60 degrees.  From the map of the lake I guessed this to be about 2400 feet. We thought this might be the corner of the moon beginning to rise. As we watched it-it flickered/flamelike. It kept the triangular shape but did not have exact edges. It looked like a fire...! yellows/oranges and reddish/brownish at the boundaries.  But the upper right corner seemed to drift in and out of the triangle.   We watched the triangle and saw about 20 meteors until about 1:45. Between 1:45 and 2:00 we witnessed the triangle rise above the trees...it was a cresent moon. We saw the moon rise and all the events to follow 3 different times.  Each episode lasting 45 minutes-1 hour with aprox. 15 minutes of inactivity between each episode.  As we watched the moon, the lower 1/4 began to break away in small pieces,travel a very short distance then return to shape the moon. They appeared like blobs-no definite shape.  But they got larger and smaller as to ""morph"" in size. They were the same firey orange color.  The smaller pieces broke away and returned 3 to 4 times-with the pieces growing larger each time.  Then as an explosion-many many very bright white spheres were emitted from the moon.  At least 50-100 spheres traveling in all directions,within the 60-90! degree area.  The movement was unlike anything man-made or any! kind of machinery I had ever seen.  It appeared lifelike-it reminded me of a swarm of bees. It also reminded me of ""Tinkerbell"" while flying.  The movements were so irradic...sideways/circular/north/south/east/west/up/down/hovering. At times they were faster than anything I have seen.  At other times they moved so slow we questioned each other to verify movement.  During this activity the degree of brightness would change from very bright to very dim,  Then they would disappear and reappear.  They appeared ""playful"". Next at about 70 degrees we noticed a circular area forming...like a black hole. The sky was clear,but clouds just appeared from nowhere.  We kept saying ""cloudlike""-they seemed to move with purpose.  As if to be alive or drawn or pulled to this area.  The clouds formed a cover/curtain in front of the black hole. It became very bright behind the cloud cover. The spheres began darting in and out from behind the cloud cover. Then the clouds just vani! shed.  Next the spheres had more purposeful movement.  They formed a pattern as if to get in line and traveled up to a small cluster of twinkling stars. This was about 85-90 degrees. Hold your arm straight out,bend wrist downward and fan open fingers. This is what the cluster looked like. It had a long tail of stars at the most North point. Next the spheres traveled down the ""fingerlike"" part of the cluster. They were in a line formation and looked like a rescue team from a helicopter-traveling down a hanging rope. At the bottom they scattered very fast and very irradic in all directions and in all 180 degrees. As some traveled closer the sphere shape appeared to be triangular. They had a circle/round light on each point of the triangle. They were all a very bright white light. Next they all traveled North /0 degrees to a bright/stationary/blinking light at the treeline. This was directly over Tinker Air Force Base. Next they were launched a few at a time South/abou! t 145 degrees,to a bright/stationary/blinking light at the tre! eline. B oth the N and S stationary/blinking lights were present during all the previous activity. Reminded me of a lighthouse. Next they were launched very fast South/Southwest to 180 degrees. They were launched in various sized groups-parallel to the treeline. Then they would disappear. It reminded me of bullets being fired from a gun. During the last 10-15 minutes we saw activity leaving the cluster/swarming/traveling North/launched South/launched SW to disappear. All simultaneously-we didn't know where to look. We felt as if we were being diverted from seeing something. We witnessed the same exact /entire episode 2 more times. The only difference being in the last episode which was aprox. 4:00-5:00. After the spheres traveled to the North light we noticed a very bright light traveling on or right above the lake towards us. It was a stationary white light that was directly North and present the entire night-atleast 3,000 feet away. It traveled very fast and irradic. Sideways/circu! lar/hovering and completely silent. The brightness faded in and out/was a single light/was 2 lights-like headlights/ we saw red and green lights. As it came closer it was the triangular shape. When it was about 3-5 feet from our shore the triangle craft disappeared and we immediately heard a small boat motor and saw a small fishing boat land on the shore. We were convinced this was an intentional attempt to make us doubt the entire evening of events. 2 men exited the boat and were camping just west of us. We were to scared to question them about anything. After a few minutes we noticed a triangle craft traveling directly towards us. It was moving so slow it took quite awhile to realize it was getting larger and closer. It was a very bright white light with circles on each point of the triangle. We started to hear noise for the first time all evening. It was fish jumping...alot of fish from all different directions. At its closest we saw faint/almost invisible ""like&quo! t; triangular wings on both sides. The entire evening I had su! ch a war m/good/devine intervention type feeling. When the craft was aprox. 500-700 feet away we heard water bubbling sounds for awhile. I felt my body move backwards as it approached and I was spooked. It started to sprinkle and within 30 seconds a downpour. I picked up my grandson and we all ran to our vehicle. We watched the craft another minute or two. Then it disappeared and the downpour stopped. We watched for another hour atleast before we headed home. That is my sighting...it is what it is. The first hour I tried to rationalize everything to my niece, until I finally realized there was no other earthly expalnation. We were witnessing actual UFO activity. To end...there were absolutely no drugs or alcohol involved. My 20 year old niece witnessed it all with me. I am thankful to have a witness. My 18 year old niece watched some of the meteors than feel asleep. She did wake up at some point and watch also...maybe an hour or so. She was scared and wanted to leave. I will never un! derstand this as I stayed awake almost 2 days from adrenaline. I am 45 years old. I have been a Registered Nurse for 21 years. I have no mental illness past or present. My nieces are both high school grads and have been very good girls. We all 3 had phones on our person and I had been to a birthday party that day and had my camera in the vehicle. Not once did the thought cross our minds to take some pictures. I guess its the shock and disbelief that keep you fixated on watching and your brain from thinking rational...",2012-09-24T00:00:00,35.23330889679715,-97.45347508896798

There is no way this could have been an airplane because it was not moving in a particular direction, there were no blinking lights, and planes can't suddenly speed up like these crafts did.

Landed in field. Note: I am an American computer engineer.  I carry dual passports so I was able to spend two years working in the UK at Intel corporation from 1995 to 1997.  During this time I had a few UFO sightings, this one was very bizarre and up close. Summer Solstice 1996 – Avebury, Wiltshire, United Kingdom   I decided to repeat my 1995 summer solstice camping trip to Avebury, UK on the 1996 summer solstice.  I camped in the same grove of trees in my hammock.  I again had hiked across the recently plowed fields and settled into the grove of trees just up the hill to the east above the famous Avebury stone circle. The radio scanner I brought with me from the USA (illegal in England) was again full of chatter from the police maintaining a 4 mile people free zone around the Stonehenge circle, as they did the year before. I heard one hilarious exchange where a couple of policemen were chasing a group of 4 people that managed to break through the barrier and were running across the fields toward Stonehenge. One officer asked for a description of the people and the reply was “they were hippie type people, carrying flowers.”  With that they sent two patrols out that quickly stopped the group. I am sure they were a real threat.  I note this because it is/was unusual for them to do this and the year before on the same day and while camping in this very spot I saw a huge UFO to the south of me in the direction of Stonehenge.  That UFO had to be hundreds of yards across, at least. Again as last year, I was watching the druidic ceremonies around the Avebury circle when I turned and noticed a white light approaching me from behind.  It was coming from the east and appeared to be coming along the 2000 year old Roman (dirt) road.  As it got closer I realized it was not on the ground, but was in the air.  I was thinking helicopter, but was unable to hear any sound even though it was only maybe 200 yards away.  As it got closer I noticed there was a spotlight of sorts coming out of this “ball of light” that was criss-crossing the ground at incredible speed.  It was like a search light on steroids, making radical sweeping and zigzag movements at lightning speed across the ground.  It appeared it might be looking for something, the ball of light was moving across the ground at a very slow pace as the search light scanned. As it got closer I could make out a clearly egg shaped ball of light with no other features except the search light.  Now only 100 yards from me and still not making any audible sound, it hovered slowly by me and then began to go back toward the east.  It moved like this, back and forth, over and over for a long time.  At some point I finally decided that it was not of this earth, certainly not man made, I accepted the fact that it was a genuine alien UFO.  I began to “think” to it. I said in my mind, “come to me over here”.  As soon as I thought this it immediately made the first movement directly toward me. I almost pissed in my pants and I immediately thought “NO!!! please go back” and it immediately moved back to its original back and forth searching.  I was fairly rattled at this point and was quite frankly scared a bit. I realized I had binoculars and I used them to try to ascertain more information. I was unable to make out any more detail with the binoculars.  In my binoculars, the object was large enough to fill ½ the view or more.  Suddenly, the entire area filled with light. I put down the binoculars and saw a 50 foot circle of light on the ground in front of the UFO.  This was no less spectacular than the scene in Close Encounters of a Third Kind.  The light was apparently coming from somewhere above and I could not see the source due to the canopy of the trees.  I was momentarily terrified, and maybe 10-15 seconds after it appeared, the light from above disappeared.  The UFO continued its ""search"". After a minute or so more the searchlight stopped, all that was left was the egg shaped ball of light moving back and forth in front of me.  It was very mesmerizing.  Slowly, the light began to dim, still moving back and forth, slowly dimming, back and forth, slowly dimming.  I watched, as it dimmed it began to slowly change shape.  It also was now almost perfectly still in the air and no longer moving back and forth.  It went from a bright egg shape to red glow that began to flatten out.  It was now so dim that I could barely see it without the binoculars.  It turned into a very flat, thin disk barely glowing a reddish color. Then it slowly descended to the ground. The next thing I recall is it is 10:30 am the next morning and I am waking up, still in my hammock.  I have no idea how I could have gone to sleep when a UFO had just landed next to me. I put this event out of my mind for a long time.  I remembered it just fine, but I never really processed it.  I never asked questions, even to myself about what it was, and what the possibilities were.  It was just one of many strange events in my life.  It was only recently (2006) that I decided that it was very strange for me to have ignored it as I had for so long.  It occurred to me that I might have been programmed in some way to not make issue of it.  I now want to know as much as I can about it. What happened to me after it landed?   Was I approached or affected by anyone or anything on board this UFO?   Update 2012:  Strangely again, this event keeps getting ignored by myself.  I feel almost compelled to ignore it. Note: at the time I wrote this report I had never before heard of anyone seeing a large ball of light UFO like this.  I have since heard a few stories very similar to my experience.  One of them I believe occurred in the same region some years later. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,,

Myself and two other friends were standing on one of my friend's front porch.  I had grown bored of the conversation and was looking at the pine trees to the south.  I was wondering when the city had put a new arc light there.  The color was the same yellow and the brightness the same intensity.  I soon realized that this light was moving.   The object then went over out heads.  It was a massive black triangle.  My fist at arms length would not have covered the object.  I measured it using my clenched fist and the back end of the triangle was four fists wide.  At the front of the triangle were two huge lights that projected beams into the night, and then down the front two sides were three smaller lights about the brightness of Jupiter in the night sky.   The object moved slowly south to north, and what sounded like a huge diesel engine could be heard.  Knowing of the missing time phenomenon, I had checked my watch when I had realized what! I was seeing and then after.   Four minutes had passed.  I know that the object was a solid triangle and not a boomerang shape because the stars were blacked out.  Later, I would say the way it moved reminded me of a blimp.   One item of note is the direction it traveled.  Almost all of the air traffic in Salisbury travels east and west; Pittsburgh to Baltimore or New York or DC.  I found it odd that it was traveling south to north.

Black triangle-shaped craft hovered at low altitude next to freeway for at least 30 minutes on Halloween night 1995.,Palm Springs,CA,1995-11-01T04:00:00,triangle,30 minutes,"Occurred : 11/1/1995 04:00  (Entered as : 11/01/95 04:00) Reported: 7/7/2012 1:49:54 AM 01:49 Posted: 8/5/2012 Location: Palm Springs, CA Shape: Triangle Duration:30 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90597.html,"Black triangle-shaped craft hovered at low altitude next to freeway for at least 30 minutes on Halloween night 1995. On November 1, 1995, at approximately 4 a.m. Pacific time, I was driving home from a concert in Los Angeles on eastbound Interstate 10 passing through Banning, Calif., on my way to Palm Springs, Calif. Three of my friends were riding in my car; one in the passenger seat was awake and two others in the back were asleep. I noticed a light in the sky straight ahead of me at a distance of what I guessed was about 10-15 miles.  At first, I thought it was the light atop the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, until I realized that it was on the opposite side of the mountains from where it should be.   I continued to watch the light, and over the next few minutes I noticed that it seemed to be pulsating, going from dim to bright and back again every 10 seconds or so. As I kept driving, I noticed a couple more things.  First, the light didn't seem to be getting closer to us on its own. Second, it wasn't changing altitude.  At this point, I remarked to my friend in the passenger seat about it and asked if he could see it, and he confirmed that he did. I told him I thought it looked like the landing lights of an airliner headed in our direction, but we both agreed that couldn't be the case since there is no airport in the direction it would have been headed. We continued to watch the light as we got closer to it, and it continued its slow pulsating, staying in the same position at the same altitude.  At this point, it was nearing 4:30 in the morning and there were several other cars on the freeway.  My friend and I had started to openly ask what it could be at this point, running through possibilities such as a helicopter or blimp. We got even closer and could tell it was something highly unusual. It was hovering above an area just beyond where the freeway split off to Highway 111, which was the route we needed to take to get home to Palm Springs. The area it was over is next to a rest stop off of Interstate 10, which at the time was brightly illuminated. As we reached the start of the turn-off for Highway 111, we could see three distinct lights facing us from the object which were pale blue in color.  They seemed to have stopped pulsating by this point but didn't illuminate the object itself. It was, as I've come to say over the years, ""stuck"" in the air.  It was only a few hundred feet off the ground at most and utterly still.  More than anything, it was the absolute stillness with which it hung in the air that convinced my friend and I that this was not a normal aircraft.  It was as if it was somehow ""disconnected"" from gravity. We'd slowed to about 10 miles an hour as we took the off-ramp and had rolled down the windows.  My friend had his head out the passenger side window and I was craning my neck to push my face against the windshield and look up at the object.  We didn't hear any sound, other than the air rushing past the car.  At this point, the object began to move very slowly across the highway directly above us.  I could clearly see three pale blue lights in a triangle formation, seemingly at the ""tips"" of the object, and one slightly larger pale blue light at what I assumed was its center.  The sky was clear and full of stars, so while I couldn't see the hull of the object, I could see that it was blocking the stars above it and appeared to be a solid triangle about 150 feet on each side from light to light.  The lights on it did not illuminate the skin of its hull, however. I kept driving and we passed underneath it. My friend watched it out of the passenger side window and then said, ""It's gone.""  The entire sighting, from when I first noticed the light to when the object passed overhead, lasted approximately 30 minutes.  During that time, I can only imagine that dozens of cars must have passed near it, since it was hovering right next to the freeway.  I've always been sort of amazed by this, especially when I'd begin to consider that perhaps it was a military test craft.  For something you wouldn't think someone would want seen, it was sitting only a few hundred feet in the air next to a fairly busy freeway.  My friend has remarked that he couldn't imagine a military vehicle utilizing a technology as exotic as anti-gravity being operated near a populated area, for fear that an accident could potentially harm a large number of people, given the sort of power source something like that would undoubtedly require.   To this day, I'm not sure if what I saw was something of ""ours,"" or not, but I came away from the experience feeling like anything was possible.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,33.80016511627907,-116.53537286821705

It was almost mid-night when they got home. I know this because I heard door opening and  went out to the living room to see who it was.

It stayed there for about 10 plus mins when it shot away toward SW in a red line and disappeared. After that, I asked my mom and dad, why did't they tell us immediately after they got home. My mom said that for some reason, she had forgotten to do so.  Then, I asked her, what took them so long to take out trash?  Did they go somewhere else?  She said no, they didn't go anywhere else expect going to the dumpster, and it was my dad who saw the UFO first on the treetop behind the apartment complex.  The object was about the size of a quarter when they first saw it.  Then, my mom urged him to go home because she was in fear.  And, they were in disbelief when they found out that they were gone for almost two hours.  They had no memory of what had happen during the time lost. After hearing that, I went to the windows and saw an object falling from the sky that looked like a huge meteorite in the general direction were the UFO had disappeared.  The object was bright white with a tail. I also noticed a big chuck of it broke off just before it disappeared behind the treeline.

Mall, July 4th 1997 I've decided that I should finally share something that I and my friend and at least one other person saw over 10 years ago. It's something to add to your database so that it could perhaps be correlated to other incidents.  Please note that I'm actually not certain that this happened on Independence Day 1997; it may have been Independence Day of 1996.  But my friend and I have talked about this event many times since then, and we're 80 percent sure it was 1997. I'm a D.C. metro area educated professional, in my mid 30's. I've long been interested in both aviation and astronomy, and know quite a bit about each.   I'm generally a very skeptical, practical and evidence-oriented person, and until the moment of this sighting, I would not have given the UFO topic the time of day.  But there were multiple witnesses to this event, so I can't simply dismiss it, and yet I also can't explain it in any conventional way. My friend and I had been to the National Mall in Washington D.C. to view the 4th of July fireworks. We had taken the Metro rail into the city, were there at The Mall all day, watched the fireworks, and they had recently ended.  We had not consumed any alcohol. The crowd there had been huge, obviously, so we waited a bit for the masses of people to thin out instead of trying to sardine ourselves onto a Metro car.  This incident therefore must've occurred around 11p.m. We were walking on the Mall on the eastern side of Washington Monument, headed west, toward the northern-most entrance to the Smithsonian Metro station.  We were not far at all from the entrance, certainly within 100 feet, when we first saw this small object.  We have always referred to it as the ""dragonfly UFO""  (Googling that phrase now, I see it has its own meaning in UFO circles.  But what we saw looked nothing like that infamous hoax.)   This object was to our left, slightly above eye-level, and I'm certain it was within 15 feet of us for this 30-second duration, and at several moments probably less than half that distance.  It was about 6 inches at its longest, and it darted and hovered the way a dragonfly or hummingbird might, with extremely quick and abrupt stops and starts. Like gravity and inertia were barely an inconvenience.  It would be hovering for a handful of seconds, and then in almost an instant it would zip over and be hovering several feet away.  We saw this particular movement probably 5 or 6 times.  The object was definitely intelligently controlled, as it seemed interested in the people in the area. It made no sound whatsoever, and given this thing's proximity to us we should have heard something. (Even considering the background noise.) It was just astounding to see. The object consisted of two main parts: a very bright main light up above, and underneath that a handful of inches was a slightly illuminated, metallic-looking dome.  Like a slightly flattened and elongated top half of a softball.  But I'm less certain of that aspect, since it was hard to see past the object's upper main light.  That light was a very bright, with a yellowish and brilliant glow, facing forward from what I perceived to be the object's front. The most interesting feature of this object, to me -- what I could see since it was slightly lower than the 'body' (itself below the main light) -- was that there seemed to be two small, slightly yellow and luminescent areas of ""haze"" underneath the central area, the area where wings should've been. This haze reminded me of the heat that rises a few inches from black asphalt on a hot summer day, but it was more intense and turbulent -- finer, in a sense.  These hazy areas were basically spherical and not very large -- maybe 2 or 3 inches -- sitting just below the body. When the object left, about 30 seconds after we first saw it, it flew towards our front left (south to southwest) very rapidly, and in a basically flat trajectory.  This would be towards what is now the Whitten Building.  It left at a speed of probably 80-100 mph, but it reached this speed very quickly, in only a second or maybe slightly more.  And one thing I specifically remember extremely clearly is that this object, when hovering and darting, did not have to yaw or turn in any way to accommodate the direction in which it was about to fly.  Knowing aviation as I do, this struck me as particularly odd. So, standard fixed- or rotor-wing flight principles were not at work here.  They just weren't.   This object clearly was not flying aerodynamically, or based on standard lift, and yet I'm confident it was intelligently controlled.  Its near instantaneous stopping and starting, the lack of sound, the unique brilliance of the top light... it was amazing.  As strange as it sounds and as! hard as it has been for me to come to terms with, I simply cannot imagine that this object was manufactured by humans. I know that many people had to have seen this object that night. I'm amazed that I've not been able to find any similar reports.

We also viewed different stars through our telescope, but got tired of looking up, so we lay down on a tarp in the grass and just looked up at the beautiful night sky. Out of nowhere, from the east, there was golden-orange colored round orb/light (very bright - glowing like) in the east, over a hill nearby, coming towards the bay. At first, I thought it was a plane who turned on its landing light for the local airport, but it was much larger than a landing light, not the right color, and there was no sound... totally silent. It appeared to be moving quite slowly, down and forward - moving east to west. Then all of a sudden another light came from it - same color, round shape, size, and same speed - but moving north without descending. The original light/orb continued, several more lights came from it and descended at same speed, but at about 45 degree angle. Other lights (2 or 3) appeared near to these. All of them would appear to turn off for a few moments, then turn back on in a direct line of path... not a blinking affect but a distinct off, then back on. A couple of them seemed to appear out of nowhere as well on either side of the original one. It was unreal... my daughter, who is 6, kept saying ""cool, mommy""... and I was in awe.  I asked my daughter to run into the house and grab my cellphone so I could video it, and the housephone to call my brother who lives right down the road. While she was inside, all of them disappeared... About 1-2 minutes later I heard a rumbling at high altitude, like jet fighters.  I could hear them to the north, and when the sound passed over, I saw what looked like the red glow of two after-burners moving due south. It had taken my daughter about 2 (maybe 3) minutes to return outside. I called my brother, and he came over... I described what I had seen. I wondered what I just witnessed.

Linear, lighter center with pulsating orange/red on each side. About 9:30 pm, Tuesday, Aug. 14, 2012.  Driving west on Stateline Rd. between Hwy 45 and Deep Lake Rd.  A large, bright orange, circular light caught my attention through the trees.  It was just north of the road, and west of my vehicle.  When I passed some of the trees, I noticed that there were actually three of the lights/objects, located in a triangular formation and slowly moving west.  I started to lose the lights in the trees again and turned north onto Deep Lake Rd to get a better look, thinking they were probably just helicopters.  When I turned onto Deep Lake Rd, I pulled over onto the shoulder and realized that there was absolutely no sound coming from the objects/lights.  At that point, they changed into a linear formation and continued moving west, past Deep Lake Rd.  While I was watching, they just blinked off as if someone had turned off a light switch.  They went off at different times, not all at once.  At that moment, I noticed another ligh! t coming from east of Deep Lake Rd., following the same course as the first three lights.  It continued further west than the first three, and I turned back onto Stateline Rd./North Ave. heading west to follow it.  I lost the light at that point because I could not keep an eye on it and keep driving.  I never saw it again. I do have a crummy still picture of two of the first group of lights on my cell phone, but it really doesn’t do them justice.  As the first three lights passed over Deep Lake Rd., I noticed that they actually seemed to have a cigar-shaped center that was bright white orange in color, and the red-orange color was pulsating from side to side.  The best description I could think of without drawing it would be a butterfly sort of shape.  I cannot believe I saw something so strange, and other than this report I have not said anything to anyone.  I do not see any similar reports to mine on your website that took place at the same time/place.  The other really eerie thing about this experience is that the entire time I was watching these lights, I did not see a single other vehicle on the road.  I cannot think of a time when I have traveled this stretch of road without seeing another vehicle.  I consider myself a skeptic when it comes to UFOs.  I have always told myself that there is an earthly explanation for all these strange sightings and events.  However, I have never seen anything even remotely close to this in the sky.  I would really love for someone to tell me what the heck I saw, and I would feel a lot better if it could be explained by something simple or familiar.

I was almost sure that she was making it up or that she saw a plane. It was dark and about 11:30 at night and we were in the backyard of my house talking when she pointed to a field about a mile away.  I looked over and I saw a white beam of light that was pointing straight down onto a field in the distance.  At first i thought it was a helicopter, but then i realized that wahtever it was, it was not making any sound whatsoever. the ""craft"" sat there for a few short minutes and the light that was shinning down on the field suddenly dissapeared as if it were turned off like a light switch. I waited to hear something take off or noise after the light dissapeared but there was nothing.. it was just gone. I was scared and there are only two thing that I believe that it could have been. The first was miltary craft, like the black secret helicopters that dont make any nose that government might have, or I saw a ufo.

During my summer vacation in 2002, I was driving from my mother’s home in Washington, MO, along Interstate 44, towards St. Louis at around noon.  My mother was in the front, passenger seat and my wife was in the back seat. As I drove along Interstate 44 just past where it connects with Highway 100 from Washington, I spotted a hazy silver disk above a hill to the left before me.  I was viewing it from quite a distance – perhaps a kilometer.  But it had the classic form of a shiny, silver disc, although its appearance was somewhat HAZY, perhaps due to the humidity of that summer day. My mind quickly went through the obvious list of possible explanations – aircraft, balloon, water tower … However it was apparent that what I was seeing was none of these.  It was hovering just above the crest of a hill in an area that is (or at least was) undeveloped and possibly part of the Missouri State Park system. My mother, sitting to the opposite side, was intently talking about something unrelated and did not see what I saw.  I considered directing her attention to the UFO, but there didn’t seem to be a chance as our car had entered a part of the Interstate surrounded by rock on both sides where highway construction had blasted through a hill. The UFO had been visible to me for around 5 or 10 seconds. From here begins the most surprising aspects of this story.  In retrospect, I should have stopped the car, backing up along the shoulder if necessary, to continue to view the UFO.  Even if that didn’t seem prudent, I should have exited the Interstate ahead and circled back to see this once-in-a-lifetime spectacle. But my overwhelming feeling was not shock or curiosity but satisfaction – “Yep, it’s true. They exist. Now I know.” Also on my mind was a lunch date with my cousins, and the prospect of being late for that. But neither of these should have deterred me from returning to that site for further observation, or the chance to produce another witness.  Especially because of the presence of my mother, we must have had a camera in the car, and possibly even a video camera. Nowadays, I seriously wonder if somehow I had been made to feel ‘satisfied’ and disinclined to further observation.  My actions were out of character, rather illogical, and highly regrettable. Here is the second bizarre element.  Years on, after listening to a particular Coast to Coast AM show that suggested a connection between UFOs and ghosts, it occurred to me that on the day of my UFO sighting, I was going to visit my father’s grave for the first time.  I had been in Japan when he died and had not attended his funeral.  It’s an odd juxtaposition of events.   I tend to think this was not a coincidence. On a final, puzzling note, my wife claims that she was in the back seat on that day and saw the UFO as well.  And she certainly was there, considering when it happened.  But for whatever reason, I don’t remember her being in the car and I especially don’t remember her having shared my sighting.  Quite the opposite, my memory is that only I saw the UFO. We experienced no loss of time.  There have been no subsequent sightings. Collaborating Testimony   It was a nice summer day when I saw a UFO in Missouri.  I was in the back of the car my husband was driving and my mother-in-law was sitting next to him. I don't remember clearly but my husband and my mother in law started talking about a UFO floating in the sky.  I had no interest in UFOs so I didn't give the conversation much attention but I saw a UFO floating in the blue sky.  It was a tiny, shining thing and the movement was it went up and down a little.  I also remember lots of green around us, so I think we were driving between woods. Since UFOs are such a superstitious thing, my seeing it is hard for myself to believe.  My husband strongly doubts that I saw it, too.  Therefore, I started doubting my memory. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2012-08-05T00:00:00,,

It was still dark outside. I saw a large tumbling ball of fire slowly pass overhead, travelling a northeasterly direction. Though I could not determine its trajectory, I had the feeling that it was falling and would probably hit the earth no more than 20 to 40 miles from where i was standing. I measured the fireball by holding my arms straight out as if i were cradling the object in my open hands. My hands were approximatly 18 inches apart.  As it passed overhead it never made a sound. I ran into the building to alert a co-worker who took a few minutes gathering her things. By the time we exited the building, day had broke, the fireball was gone and there was no trace of it, no trail of smoke, nothing. I know of two other people who witnessed this same event. What I remember most about the event was 1). The fireball appeared to b! e very large, 2). The fireball drifted across the sky very slowly, 3). The fireball was completely silent and 4). The fireball fell from the sky at the same time that the space shuttle columbia was reentering earths atmosphere. Freinds of mine suggested that perhaps i had seen peices of the space shuttle however the fireball I saw was bigger than a space shuttle. It wasnt until Columbia was somewhere over Nevada that it began to disintegrate and moments before it exploded into unrecognizable debris, columbia still maintained the outlineof a ""plane"" with a nose and fuseladge etc. what I saw was competely engulfed in flames and did not resemble a ""plane"" at all.

My little brother, best friend, and I were on a routine camping trip to the mountains above Wallace, ID one summer in July back in 2006.  We have camped at this location, an abandoned mine shaft, many times over several years.  We used to spend entire weekends up here and around most of the mountains in the silver valley exploring old buildings, mines, and hiking into the forest to find untouched ruins. After a day of exploration we settled at the campsite which is a large flat area out of a steep hillside created by the removal of waste rock from the adjacent mine shaft.  It has a view and we have traditionally shot clays over the edge because of the drastic drop off.  So we had a campfire, beers, dinner, music and just waiting for the stars to shine for a few hours.   Around 10pm or so, it is almost completely dark and I noticed a light glowing on the hillside across the valley or draw.   It was small but bright and amber in color.  It appeared to be near the ground or in the trees.  It did not light up the ground or the trees, it did not move, it made no sound.   We sat and reasoned about what it could be.  I am very familiar with the area and there are no roads or even trails on that side of the valley.  The hillside is quite steep with tall trees and loose talus, making a camp spot unlikely.  I also think we would have noticed people over there during the daylight. I tried to get a closer look with a rifle scope but my scope was not strong enough.  I did not shoot at the light for fear it was people or something more dangerous.  My brother, friend, and I were very spooked and decided to retire to the tent and sleep with our small arms for the illusion of safety. I woke up early before sunrise to pee and the light was gone. The next day, there was no trace of anything across the draw. We discussed the situation for hours the next day with no decent explanation. I will try to find a picture of the area where the light was seen, again, we have been to this spot at least 10 times over the years.

When I leaned forward is when i saw the bullet shaped craft slowly floating by. I looked out my drivers side window and had a direct line of sight at the side of it, there were no markings on the side of it any where.  My 1st thought for whatever reason was to look for any markings that were USAF, it was only the height of a electric pole above me and slightly behind me.  It was a light color white/gray maybe white/blue i can only be sure it was a light color.  The thing that has stuck with me since the sighting is, the bottom of the craft it had 3 seperate panels that were all lite with a white light.  The panels were the entire size of the bullet shape craft, each panel though was seperate. It also had wings on the sides and to me only looked to be maybe 3 feet tall in total. Never have really understood what i saw still don't but, the entire craft was the length of the chevy custom van i was driving at the time.  After it floated off far enough my van just magicly came back to life engine was on as well as the lights, and i was gone as was as my van would go really freaked out.

As I was standing there wondering how I got there I could see a small pin hole of light out ahead of me at about eye level.   As I looked at it the light got bigger and came right at me.  As it passed by it was like a wave of light and as it went past me it almost felt like it pushed me back a little.  Then I could feel the presents of someone behind me.  As I turned around there were three smaller gray beings with large black eyes.  Standing shoulder to shoulder.  They looked similar to what most call the grays. As I looked at them I wasn't alarmed or frightened at all.  I had the feeling that I knew them.  Then I could hear in my head,  ""We need your help.""  I said OK.  The thing was the way they said it.  It was like they were saying it to someone they knew.  Plus, I answered as if I was talking to a neighbor or friend. The next thing I can remember is I am standing in a different area of our property.  It’s like I can barely stand up I’m so tired.  I’m sweating as if I had been working or hot.  I can’t move but I can see a bright light at ground level that is behind me.  As I look up with my eyes I can see two craft that are identical.  The main body is a large round area that has dark red or burgundy lines that move around it.  They are very glossy.  The main body was dark.  Then there are two straight arms or beams that come out at about a 30 degree angle.  They are green in color.  Then two bright glowing spheres at the ends that pulsate white light.  It’s hard to say how far away they were because I don’t know how big they were but my guess is they were about 3 to 4 hundred feet above the ground and about the same distance apart.  Maybe 500 feet apart. I can notice something out of the corner of my eye.  So I try and turn my head. It like it’s glued in place. I try with everything I have and I can move it just enough to see two other men standing like I am about six feet away from me to my left.  They both look like I feel. I have never seen them before. I can’t see anything else.  It is so still out. Not a breath of wind or noise.  I can’t see anything but the ships.  The next thing I know I hear a rumbling and a big hole in the sky opens up! I could see blue sky with white clouds in it as if I were looking though a window.  Large clouds formed the outer circle of the hole and were turning in on themselves.  Like if you rolled up a news paper. Then in the blink of an eye the first ship zipped into the hole followed almost instantly by the second one.  Then after the second ship went in there was like a clap of thunder and the hole closed up.  The next thing I know I’m sitting straight up on the couch with what has to be the biggest adrenalin rush I’m ever had.  I instantly get up, looked at the clock and it was a little after 5 am.  I grabbed a piece of paper and our kid’s crayons and started to draw what I had just seen.  The whole time it was like, ""What the Hell just happened?""  It was real, as real as you’re sitting reading this right now. About an hour later having had settled down as I sat trying to figure out what it all meant my wife came down getting ready for work.  I didn't say anything because I wasn't sure what to say.  She told me later on the phone that our eldest daughter who was eight at the time had come to sleep with her because she woke up and saw very bright lights flashing out of the top dormer window of our house.  She saw about 11 flashes before she got scared and went under the covers then she headed to mom.  Well, my jaw about hit the floor when she was saying this.  I hadn't said anything to anyone about what had happened to me at this point.  Was this some kind of conformation of what had happened?  An incidental independent conformation?  I talked to our daughter about it later and she told me about the same thing she told my wife.  She said it wasn't like lighting but like a really bright light blinking like a stop light kind of thing only slower.  Now, she is not afraid of thunder storms and we! like to watch them so a flashing light wouldn't have scared her but she said it was different. Well for the next week or so I was sick like I had the flu.  Tired, aching, and a bad headache which was weird because I never get headaches. I  filed a report with MUFON that day and sent the drawings I made.  Over the next week after I was feeling better we went to the hobby store because I had to make a model of the craft I saw. I didn't know what stuff I was looking for but looked until I had what I could use to make it.  I then took a picture of it so you could see what it looked like from my vantage point. I know its old school but I can’t do computer generation stuff.  Then I made a picture of the hole in the sky.  It’s weird but it was almost like in the movie Close encounters where he was always trying to make the mountain.  I told my wife what happened and she believes me but is also an ""I have to see it to believe it"" type.  I know to her it’s a way out there story but it is what it is.  I can only tell what happened to me. Life got back to as normal as it can after something like this happens.  Over the years since I have photographed blue clouds over or near our house which both of our girls saw and last year I found a strange mark on the inside arch of one of my feet.  I also took a pic of it.  It was four pin holes that had scabs that made a perfect square with one right in the middle and one outside of the square.  I couldn't feel it at all and never would have seen it if not by chance.  It was gone in a day or two.  I now seem to have a better understanding of how everything is connected together.  Humans with nature and nature with the universe and so on.   It’s like we are all one.  I know it sounds weird and before this all happened I probably would have rolled my eyes at it.  But it did happen, we are NOT alone in this universe and we are all connected.  It was a life changing event to say the least.  It doesn't run my life but it’s always there.  Running though my head like an endless movie clip.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,42.69180000000001,-85.9931

I thought that would be a cool picture and took out the camera I always have with me and snapped a picture the time stamp on the photo was 11:29:29.  Nine seconds later I snapped another one as the nose of the blimp had dipped down the time stamp on this one was 11:29:38.   When I opened the picture up on my computer and saw the photos there was an object in the first picture behind the blimp but the second picture only had the blimp.  The camera [a Sony DSC T-10, 7.2 mp] was set at the highest resolution 7.2 mega pixels and was at maximum zoom, I do this regularly for distant photos so they can be magnified again on the computer. After I realized that there was something behind the blimp I zoomed in on that portion of the image just shy of having it go mosaic and have not been able to identify what it is.  But it does look like a lot of photos I’ve seen on the internet.  If you look closely there seems to be a pinkish haze around the object.  Maybe an energy field?   It should be noted that commercial air traffic is regularly in the air space in the direction I was looking.  T F Green Airport [Warwick Rhode Island] is approximately 6 miles south from the position I snapped the photos from.  I only took the photos because the blimp was so clear and in a cloudless sky.  I saw nothing in the sky but the blimp when I took the picture.  It would be difficult to estimate the distance of the blimp from my position but I would take a stab at one to two miles. Also I do not have any photo enhancing software to see the image through filters as often shown on the internet but maybe someone else could do this.

I am confused as to exactly what direction I am looking (definitely south, probably west - leaning to east). Just over the tree line was an orange/red orb. Definitely much bigger than a star – probably at least a hundred times bigger than a star.  Imagine a watch battery, cut into quarters and that was the size in our view. It hovers, then it moves parallel to the left. Then it arcs up and to the right.  It hovers.  Then it arcs down and to the right. Then it zooms directly left to its original spot that we saw it. Then it shoots diagonally to the right.  It continues this unusual pattern for the next 5 minutes.  Then another orange/red orb appears below and to the left of the fir! st one.  It moves to the right and then both of them disappear below the tree line not to show up again. In order to validate this, I tapped the shoulder of the guy next to me on the hill and asked him and his date to look up. They definitely saw it move, but declined to acknowledge anything and responded by whispering something in each other’s ear. Probably something about this nutcase next to them!

My neighbors were out and witnessed the same formation, and we discussed what ehy could be.  There was absolutely no sound, the darkness from the power outage made for a clear and undistorted viewing.  As they flew in a northwesterly direction, several of the shapes changed position in a rapid, darting movement, at sharp angles, before disappearing into the distance.  I continued down the street, and encountered 2 other neighbors, who had also seen the same lights.  They also reported hearing no sound from the objects, even though they appeared to be at a low altitude, perhaps 2000-3000 ft. At  th! e end of the block , several people were outside, discussing the power outage and the work of the power company crew making repairs.  At about this time, roughly 10 minutes after observing the formation of lights, 3 more lights streaked overhead, in a single file formation, 2 close together and the ""tail end Charlie"" at a greater distance back, moving at an even higher rate of speed to catch up.  They were travelling at speeds much faster than military or civilian aircraft, and made no sound of any kind. As the first two travelled off in the same northwesterly direction as the earlier objects, they split off 90 degrees from each other and appeared to come to a hover, allowing the 3rd object to catch up, and then all 3 disappeared at something like warp speed.

It was equal to size, color, and intensity as the other two stars that stayed put.

Then the last minute it maintained the same speed and simply disappeared.  No clouds in the sky.  No ridge line to block view.  The thought to be star for 3 minutes before movement simply disappeared 3 total minutes later. It wasn't a shooting star.  I have seen plenty of those in my lifetime, nor a airplane.

From where I was standing, I would guesstimate it to be maybe only 400 ft above me and 500 ft in front of me.  My first thought after gazing on it! and adjusting my eyesight was that it was a drone of some sort.  It looked like it might of had wings but it just seemed blurry...not my sight, but the object itself.  It wasn't moving very fast at all...maybe 15 mph. I don't know why there would be a drone flying above the rural countryside of Kansas with the nearest house being close to 5 miles away from my position, so I tried to rule out that it was a drone.  I watched it and even waved at it slightly and eventually it disappeared like it went behind an invisible curtain or something. The thing that struck me as odd was that it was a completely still as it flew by. I don't recall any wind blowing, hearing any bugs in the grass, or any cows mooing in the distance. I didn't sense it to be anything malevolent, I was calm when watching it fly by. Couldn't tell if there were any lights on it because it was still daylight.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,39.3569,-100.3863

On or about May 1, 2009, around 8:00 p.m. on a clear night, I was driving home from dinner with my sister and our girlfriend.  We live in a rural part of town with a few farms, and several neighborhoods. It is very peaceful and everyone practically knows each other. Here is a recount of what I saw that night.  I was driving my SUV, my sister was in the passenger seat, and our girlfriend was in the back seat behind the passenger.  As I made a left hand turn onto my girlfriend’s street, my girlfriend and I noticed bright, white lights just above the treetops about 300 yards away.  My friend and I saw what looked like to be a “horizontal shaped Ferris-wheel” type object in bright, white lights (several lights spaced apart but looked to be connected vertically) hovering just over the treetops at the end of an open field.  The object was not moving. The lights were spaced in two’s – one on top, one on the bottom, perfectly aligned, perfectly distanced from one another – they were several of them. The circular object was huge!  We were speechless.  When I finally had to put my eyes back onto the road, the two of us were hysterical.  We asked my sister what she thought about it, but she was looking straight ahead at the road.  She never saw th! e lights.  At first, we thought someone was having a party and had rented circus-type rides.  However, why would the rides be above the treetops?  We decided I should keep driving while we tried to locate the lights in the sky so my sister could see them.  I ended up driving a three-mile loop, but they were gone.  From the time she and I saw the lights to driving the three-mile loop, about 5 minutes had passed.  There was absolutely no sighting of anything in the sky, nor no sighting of any parties in the neighborhood. As we dropped off our girlfriend, we told her father about what we saw.  I wanted to call the police department.  He told us we were crazy!  He asked us what we ate for dinner.  My girlfriend and I ate the chicken fingers with fries and he told us something was in the food.  I still cannot get that vision out of my mind.  I drive past that area all time, as it is about two miles from my home. I was 44 years old and working at the family business.  My girlfriend was 38 years old and owned a hair salon.  My sister, also 38 years old, works at the family business.  Whenever we get together, we reminisce about that night and what we saw.  We both believe it was something extraterrestrial. This isn’t the first time I noticed odd things in the sky.  I know it won’t be my last. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2012-08-05T00:00:00,,

I have been shooting photographs and videos of some very strange extraterrestrial phenomena here near my home ever since my first UFO sighting in July of 2010.   I began publishing my experiences and content first on YouTube and then finally on my own website Alien Reality (www.alienreality.net).  Normally I do not submit my experiences to reporting sites like yours or Mufon. This particular sighting however was so significant to me that I simply felt compelled to not only publish it but to officially report it to the appropriate agencies. Mid week last week I submitted an official report to MUFON (as I had done only one other time on another matter) and they have thus far completely ignored me.  Unreal. Contact me at your convenience.  This is an absolutely true and factual retelling of what happened to me and the media I shot is entirely genuine. ((personal information deleted)) This last Saturday, August 18 at about a quarter till one in the afternoon I managed to witness and record what to me is among the most amazing things I have ever had the privilege to view. I had made arrangements to go over to a friend’s house that afternoon and right prior to leaving I was doing some chores in my backyard and noticed that the clouds that day were particularly thick and many were shaped very oddly. I went inside to retrieve my camera and once outside again I began snapping photos. Suddenly, a bit behind me to the west I saw what appeared to be a flying or tumbling black object.  The moment it registered in my head that this was all sorts of unusual, the object was directly overhead. It was traveling rather quickly despite its awkward tumbling and occasional diving motions.  Soon afterwards it was to the east of me and that is when I began to snap photographs of this thing that I had just seen in the sky.. My first thought was that this was a trash bag or some other sort of debris flying in the sky which sometimes happens on a windy day.    However, that thought quickly left as I continued photographing.  The shape and structure of this thing was not at all like a trash bag or other paper or plastic trash.  It appeared to be box-like to some extent or it seemed more rigid than a bag would be blowing in the wind.  It also tumbled as it flew past and onward and dove occasionally but not very far or for very long.  The entire time it flew it was actually escalating in altitude. I managed to shoot about six shots that afternoon and towards the end of my encounter I shot about 15 seconds or so of video using the MPEG setting on my still camera.  Reviewing my shots on my camera’s LCD I was excited that I had managed to capture something that was clearly unusual at a minimum and potentially monumental on the far side of that equation. I had captured it seemed a low flying alien craft that was no more than 200 feet off the ground and if it wasn’t alien in origin it certainly had to be some sort of secret governmental drone device.  But as I stated earlier I was expected at a friends house in the neighboring town and I was already late so I left my things alone and went off till early evening to do something else. When I got back I put my card in the card reader and extracted the photos that I had taken earlier.  As I was able to blow up the photos I took extremely closely I was shocked at what I saw.  The photos that I had the good fortune to capture earlier that afternoon were not of any debris or trash flying in the sky.  That is clearly the case as even if a case could be made for that as the object in the photos there was barely any wind that day at all.  A slight breeze of 5 mph was what was recorded for Saturday.   That was not enough wind to carry around anything let alone catapult a large squarely shaped trash bag ever upward.  I was mistaken earlier that was for certain in describing the object as some sort of craft or ship. It was not. Photo reveals a living creature flying in the air that resembles an amphibian. The photos reveal that what I saw and photographed that day was a living being; seemingly as alive as me or you and he was clearly not from here.  The being in the sky that I photographed had an amphibian or reptile-like appearance with a very large mushroom shaped head, large eyes and a large mouth.  His head was disproportionately larger than his body which I saw clearly was comprised of a pair of legs and arms.  His back seemed to be sheathed, resembling an armadillo of sorts and as the pictures indicate he is capable of enfolding himself into himself potentially for protection or possibly navigation.  In his left hand he held what must be a wand or stick with a very bright light ball at the end.  Finally, this creature had a tail that was visible and pointed downward even when he was folded into his sheath as you can see in the later photos. I am still in awe of this experience and count it to be among the most profound of my now 49 years.  As I write this it is my birthday and I simply couldn’t have asked the universe for a better present.  The profound nature of these photos is what astonishes me and even now I simply cant’ put my mind around it.  We are indeed no longer alone in the cosmos. This is direct photographic proof that alien creatures exist and that as I have been stating all along; they are here.  I understand that there will be naysayers and those who seek to poke holes in this material and in me and to them I say “bring it on.” I will meet you at any time or any place to debate not only the veracity of my experience but also of the pristine condition of these photographs the originals of which have been safely backed up offline.  These photos are not and were not altered in any way with the exception of enlargement in order to see this low flying creature.  I will make copies of these master photos available to anyone who wishes to view them as I did initially.  They are real and as sure as I am alive and present this is the truth. May the truth of this information and the profundity of its ramifications resonate in your heart and all of our hearts.  May this not cause anyone to be afraid or angry or war-like in their approach.  The time for that old paradigm is past and will shortly be forever buried as we embark on a new era of understanding of ourselves and the universe around us.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,33.414035671514114,-111.92091958939265

I was in Mukilteo, WA on the night of Friday August 18th, 2012, near the ferry on the waterfront.  It was approximately ½ hour before dark, the end of dusk, with my back to the water I looked up in the sky to see an odd occurrence. Knowing Boeing field was directly east of my location I was used to seeing airplanes fly overhead.  I am very aware what they look like in the sky, the sounds they make and which colors their lights put off and how much light each light may glow.  I was very confused to see bright orange orbs in the sky (school bus orange) about as high as a small aircraft would fly above the ground.  I immediately thought it was in fact an airplane however there was no sound and the lights were not the lights on the wing because they were too bright and too far away from each other, as well as too large (the size of large blimps).  I also was alarmed because if they were two different aircrafts then they were flying too close.  I was very confused. I noticed 3 at first in the shape of an upside down V with the left point extended farther than the two other trailing points.  Then they slowed down and waited for the fourth point to join them that created a diamond shape in the sky and turned sharply and slowly as if not afraid to be seen and headed east toward Boeing field, then over the mountains.  We were able to watch them for a very long time; we visually lost them at dark. I originally thought they could have been Chinese lanterns, after the small airplane idea did not make sense, but there is NO WAY the lanterns could have burned this bright and been this large.  I have lit the lanterns before here in Washington and in Hawaii so I know what they look like close and far away. On a side note: the radio station 92.9FM that I normally listen too in clarity would not come through that night on the radio I was listening on all night and had listened to 92.9 on it previously.  I have never called or documented any UFO sightings before this and I would like to know what could have made this happen in the sky, I am just curious.  I am one of several people that were very confused by this experience and can’t wait to hear what it really was. Thank You,   J.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,47.913,-122.3042

I had taken my 2 sons to see a movie at the IMAX in downtown Raleigh that Saturday night.  As we were leaving to come home, I saw 25-30 circular lights in the sky overhead.  Instantaneously, and only for a second, I thought there must be some type of fireworks show going on.  However, the lights did not disappear.  At this point, I did not believe there was anything other-worldly about them (I just thought it was unusual and I wanted to see what these things were).  I pulled the car into the nearest stop (a Hess gas station).  My 2 children and I got out of the car and saw what now only seemed to be about 10 -15 fireballs in the sky directly over our head.  I knew then that this was something spectacular as these fireballs seem to move deliberately in pairs of two or three and at a very slow pace.  They emitted no sound, but they definitely moved in patterns that were not random and there was an ebb and flow to their movement.  Again, all these fireballs see! med to be grouped together in packs of 2 or 3 and seemed to be interacting with one another.  As they went over our head, they seemed to suddenly disappear.  By the time I got my I-phone out to take a video, only a couple remained in the sky.  I will send that video to you so you can get an idea of their movement, but unfortunately they appear smaller in the video than what we saw with our own eyes.  The entire sighting took less than 5 minutes, and by the end of the 5 minutes, both my children were very scared.  I was not (in fact, I felt incredibly blessed to have witnessed something I believed was very special), but we quickly got back in the car and headed home as I did not want to unnecessarily frighten my children. I watched the news that night looking for a report on what I saw (I even suspected there might be some breaking news on it as this was over downtown Raleigh, a very public place).  However, there was no mention of it.  I even e-mailed my video to the local weather guy (a friend of mine), but he did not comment on it.  I just let it go until I heard Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast AM tell the listeners to report something even it is was several years ago.  So that is what I am doing here.

It moved slowly across the sky maybe 30-40 mph.

My husband and I were watching TV in our living room, that is in the east part of the house, when he saw some very strange orange lights coming into view through the window.  He ran outside, yelled at me to come out on the deck, and I ran to join him, along with our seven year old daughter. Up in the eastern sky were small, orange spheres of light, silently  and slowly flying to the west.  Each one (we counted 16 in all) was perfectly and evenly spaced from the others, glowing a bright orange, and each one banked to the north at the exact same point in the sky.  The night was completely still, cold, no wind, and as far as we know, there were no other witnesses, even though we live in a highly populated suburb. My husband, an aerospace engineer/physicist, ran inside to grab a pair of binoculars to get a better look at them.  At first he thought they were Chinese lanterns, but upon closer examination with the field glasses, he could ascertain no form, no type of material whatsoever, in their makeup.  They appeared to be made of light.  Also, they did not vary in altitude or waiver in any direction, as might be the case if there had been a current of wind that could affect them. They were completely silent, and really beautiful to watch.  I am not a good judge of altitude, unfortunately, but I would estimate that they were about a thousand feet up, and at that height, appeared to about the size of a basketball in the sky.  They came in groups of two, then four, but all precisely spaced apart.  We saw 16 in all, but I suspect that we had missed the first groupings. Our seven year old was entranced by them, and yelled her opinion of the event with great awe:  ""Santa Claus!!""",2012-08-05T00:00:00,38.8175,-77.6308

Four of us were downstairs on the patio when we started to notice two huge lights from what we thought was an airplane. We commented on how big the headlights were when all of a sudden we saw this thing slow down and then it started to speed up and then it slowed down again to a STOP!   At one time we all said an airplane can’t do that. I also notice there was small red lights going up off this vessel that was visible in the sky.  I asked my friend if he had binoculars and to get them.  By this time this vessel made a right hand turn and started moving away and vanished. The lights were so big and bright you could not see the shape of it. We watched other airplanes that night fly over in certain fly patterns which this vessel seem to be in as well, before it made an about turn to the right and vanish.  All the airplanes we saw had the red light at the wing and we could see them flying for a long distance on this clear night.  This vessel was not following the same pattern the rest of the planes did and was not visible in a matter of a second.  This aircraft had no sound to it at all, it was just there. This craft also flew lower than the other planes that were in the same fly pattern.  What it was, I don’t know. On Wednesday morning I was talking to a girl from Italy on Facebook.  As we chatted, she tells me her Mother, Father and her also witness a UFO that same night at 9 pm. Could it be the same one?  I was fascinated and stunned at the same time. If it is the same aircraft or vessel, it had to travel awful fast to be here where we saw it.  She said her father works with airplanes all the time and he said that he knows that could be not a plane or helicopter for that matter.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,42.14263184079602,-75.90816368159204

((NUFORC Note:  One of six sightings from same source, submitted over the course of two months.  PD)) (Full disclosure:  Was MUFON member 1988-1992, involved in investigation of 08/89 local overflight of multiple objects.  Report subsequently posted online.   Also, participant in 2009 UFO Hunters segment.  Have been utilizing NUFORC for several years as reference in attempt to identify local areas of repeat sightings.)   Interested in the 06/06/12 Milford sightings posted to NUFORC, and being very familiar with the area, I decided to proactively scout that shoreline area, judging from numerous NUFORC entries that frequent sightings of the ""orange orbs"" were currently taking place in that vicinity. On June 16, or 23, at 9:15PM I arrived near Gulf Beach, Milford, not expecting much.  Almost immediately I observed a low flying aerial light of unusual color which was traveling from the west to the east, approximate altitude 700 feet, no sound.   This light passed over  the water, between the shore and Charles Island, which is about a mile south,  therefore it could not have been more than half a mile away.   Within a minute of my noticing it, the light veered south , along the eastern edge of Charles Island, and headed towards Long Island.  Within less than a minute I lost sight of it as it departed, maintaining the same altitude. Considering this sighting to be a mere coincidence, or simply a case of my own lack of proper observation (which I have learned from much hard experience to be cautious about), I shrugged  it off.  Much too coincidental to be possible.  Also, I must mention that this light had originally appeared moving from the direction of the local Stratford/Sikorsky airport, which is situated only a few miles west of this beach area, near the Sound.  On the other hand, I should mention that after several years of “plane spotting” around LI Sound, I have never seen aircraft lights of that particular color – my initial reaction was piqued curiosity.  The light was a very warm yellow, with a reddish fringe around its circumference.  It was steady, and there were no other blinking or strobing or steady identifying or anti-collision lights near it. Within a matter of a couple of minutes another identical light appeared,  following the exact same flight-path as the first, executing the  exact same manuver to the south,  fading from view in the exact same way.   This time I was much more diligent , using a small 10x25 monoscope to try and make out any fuselage.   None seen, no sound heard.  Still, this combined event did not overly impress me.   Nonetheless, over  time, and further review of more recent NUFORC reports, I decided to follow up on that evening’s event.   Over the past two months, equipped with  8x40 binoculars, every opportunity I could get resulted in nothing. However, on Saturday, August 18,  I stationed myself at Gulf Beach, Milford.  From 8:30PM to about 10PM, nothing.  Preparing to leave, I noticed a bright reddish light approaching over the treeline from the north.  The noise of waves, marsh frogs, some traffic, and some teenagers made listening difficult but I heard no sound from what I at first assumed was a shuttle helicopter.  At something like 750 ft altitude (uncertain because no way to judge the size), this light moved silently overhead until it simply faded away.   The appearance of the light was something like a lens, a red rimmed lens through which a very bright yellowish light was being projected, though not in a beam but rather in a way that scintillated, giving the oval object a somewhat firey appearance. Impressed, I decided to wait, operating under  the assumption that these things appeared in tandem or in some sort of sequence.   And, as if on schedule, another identical light emerged from the north, following what seemed to be the exact same flight path.  This time there was enough quiet that, even with my ears cupped, I could not hear any sound from the object whatsoever.  On approach, this light seemed to waver very slightly, as if it might suddenly change direction.   However, it continued to silently and steadily pass overhead, moving south while ascending somewhat until, as it passed above, almost on cue as I expected , the light simply expired within the Summer Triangle.  Ordinarily, even when aircraft bank, or their lights are no longer visible as they were while approaching, one can still see some aspect of it as it departs.  In this case, as diligently as I looked for it I could not see any trace of the UFO.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,41.223742105263156,-73.05265438596491

Our base camp was about half way between Eureka and Carlin Nevada on Rte 278. Middle of nowhere. I had the evening off, and decided to start a camp fire shortly after dark. I had just opened a beer and was playing my guitar when the red lights showed up. Before I start my description I have to say that my recollection of this sighting is hazy, it happened over a year ago, and even a few days later I could not remember details. What I remember is a very low pitched, quiet hum.  That is what go my attention.  I looked behind me, and two glowing red lights were hovering near by. I set down my guitar and stood up, walking toward the lights to see better. I noticed another set behind them.  I could not see the outline of any object, only the lights, but the way they were moving, it seemed that they were connected.  They were moving strangely, as if the objects were long and flat and turning from a horizontal position to a vertical position.  It took me a minute to realize the red lights were connected and the object was enormous. At some point one set of lights came close, or at least it seemed close due to the scale of the object. I would say it was at least 50 meters in diameter.  I do not remember the object leaving.  That is the strangest part. I was sitting at the campfire, and was not going to tell any of my coworkers (they were small minded) when they came back from the field.  One of my co-workers, who I had a good rapport with came to the fire and stood there with me for a few minutes before saying ""I just saw a ufo"". I nearly pissed I was so excited. He described red lights, but in a different, more stereotypical ""ufo""; configuration.  More like spinning red lights.

The event in question occurred at around 12:50 am.   Last year around this same time I did see a large triangular shaped object in the sky that hovered over my neighborhood, and then took off at an extremely impressive speed without any sound whatsoever, but in this case I did not see a UFO.  I know that this form is for UFO sightings only, however, what I heard last night was so strange that it had to be something unexplainable.   I was sitting up in bed reading, and I heard something just outside my window (there’s a busy street just by my house) that at first sounded like screeching tires.  I thought that someone had hit a deer because there are many that live by in the area, but then the tone of the screeching changed.  There were three different tones to it, and the duration of each tone would last for about ten seconds and then it would change.  I realized as soon as it changed that it wasn’t a car crash. The sound continued to change in tones without any brea! ks in between.  As crazy as this sounds, it sounded like that scene in Close Encounters of the Third Kind where they contact the aliens using music. It was very loud and very high pitched.  It went on for at least 2 minutes.  I looked out my window to see if I could see anything in the sky, but my window isn’t at a very good vantage point, and I didn’t want to go outside because I was worried I’d miss the noise.  I didn’t feel at all scared or threatened.  It was just very strange, and I knew that I was experiencing something that wasn’t normal. I think that someone else out on the road either heard what I was hearing, or saw something because in the midst of the noise going on,  I did hear a separate noise of tires coming to a hault out on the road.  So this is just pure speculation, but perhaps someone saw something in the sky.  Last year when I saw the Triangular shaped craft, it was very large, and had a lot of different colors of lights all around it. It approached my neighborhood, which is a townhouse community, and stopped over a row of houses. It hovered there for a few seconds, and then took off at a sharp 90 degree angle, and was completely gone. During that sighting there was no sound whatsoever that came from the craft, even when it took off. A few nights later my mother was out walking our dog, and she saw what perhaps could be the same craft. It approached the same row of houses, making no noise at all, and then took off and reappeared in the same area, took off again , then reappeared in a different section of the sky almost as if it was shuffling across the sky.  I’m wondering if perhaps there was another craft in the area and if perhaps more people are going to report experiences like this where they see a craft and hear music coming from the craft. Perhaps they’re attempting to communicate with us now.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,39.14072038404727,-77.20584416543575

I stopped and tried to take a picture and all of a sudden they were gone except for 2.  But these 2 were almost over the trees and I could not get a picture. Did anyone else see these orange disc’s?",2012-09-24T00:00:00,45.6452,-122.3789

My family and I were traveling NW at 70 MPH on CA-170 (Hollywood Fwy.) between Magnolia and Oxnard. I spotted a metallic/reflective object to the NW near Valley Glen area. We observed the object for several minutes as we approached closer then passed it. Object had a V or Chevron shape approx. 40 degree angle. The object hovered at about 1000-1500 feet – similar to traffic helicopter altitude.  A plane landing or taking off from a regional airport was passing at the same time a couple thousand feet above the object. The behavior was the oddest thing, it seemed as if it was tumbling in place while it hovered, which is how we could tell what shape it was from our approaching angle. We exited the freeway to see if we could get a better look, but could only see it between gaps in buildings. 5 min later we got back on the freeway it had moved north approximately 1-3 miles and was now NW of us again.  We observed for another 1-2 min as we passed it yet again. Our first impression is that it could be a large balloon, as it seemed like it was tethered, but that didn’t make sense since we had moved locations on the freeway and there was no visible tether as we got closer. I had the impression that it looked like the letter V and thought it looked a lot like a House Industries Neutraface Bold “V”. It was 3D and had solid mass to it.  The sun really flared off of the sharp angles and surfaces, almost like a mirror; which is why it caught my attention in the first place. Based on its altitude it must have been the size of our minivan, maybe bigger. I always look up at movement in the sky ever since I was a kid. I have watched many types of aircraft fly over day and night. After looking at thousands of aircraft in my lifetime, this does not fit any of the shapes and/or flight behaviors of anything I have seen.

At this point both of my neighbor's kids as well as my wife and other child were called out to observe this.  My neighbor started to video record it with his cell phone. The quality is not bad considering it was a phone.  We watched it continue north then it changed appearance and became a black orb in the sky, as if it were able to turn its lighting source off.   At this point we observed it sharply turn to the west and we continued watching until it was out of our sight due to trees and roof lines.  About two to three minutes passed from the time it was first observed by my son and the time all of us lost it in our view as a black round orb. Moments after we! lost sight I noticed a commercial jet passing overhead traveling east.  This is a typical international route so the plane was at cruising altitude and you could hear the engines, which it very normal and occurs about twice an hour at our location.

I was in front of my house which faces east as I observed it. As it got closer to where I was, I thought it may have an engine on fire as it had an orange glow and much larger in size than a landing light.  It was circular in shape but not constant in that it oscillated. I estimated it’s altitude to be between 2 and 5 thousand feet, now passing directly south, I realized that there was no sound associated with the object. Nor did it have typical aircraft navigation lights. It was then that I went back into the house to retrieve a camera to video the object. My home is in a flight path of the Rochester Airport in Monroe Country which is about 18 miles away to the west so I am familiar with planes which routinely pass nearly overhead as they approach runway 10/28 from the east.  Depending on weather, they are between 2600 and 6500 feet elevation traveling at about 180 knots.  While they usually pass just to the north, they sometimes will pass to the south of my house. The first object’s entire flight took it east to west in a fairly straight path at a constant velocity of perhaps 100 knots.  It disappeared over trees in my back yard facing west.  When I say overhead, it traveled through constellations Aquila and Ophiuchus at what I estimate to be about 55 to 65 degrees of elevation over the southern horizon. Soon after a second similar object appeared from over the south side of the house, since now I was on a western facing deck and the house obstructed my view to the east.  It appeared to follow the same trajectory at about the same velocity as the first object.  I was able to get about 11 seconds of video of that object until it too disappeared behind trees to the west. Later, at about 10:15, two more similar objects were spotted on the eastern side of the house, but this time slightly north and again moving east to west.  I called my neighbor out of his house to observe and again, I took a video.  While doing that, the first object flickered out followed shortly after  by the second while still in the northeastern sky.  This time they appeared to be lighted balloons.  My neighbor is a New York State Trooper and we both concluded that they must have been balloons with flares, or something similar.  What is odd is that prevailing winds are out of the west, and these objects traveled to the west.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,43.1433,-77.2879

On February 22nd, 2012, my wife and I headed off to Ash Wednesday Mass at about 6:40 pm.  As we drove through downtown Cold Spring Minnesota, we traveled east towards Rockville, Minnesota where our church is.  As we drove through downtown, we both noticed two crafts flying to our south about two blocks away and at about the height of the water tower.  The two crafts were south of the water tower.  So they were to our right as we were driving. We were both transfixed on them because it seemed so strange two crafts flying that low and slow.  At first we thought they might be helicopters, but they there were flying very close to each other.  They were in a formation with the lead craft slightly ahead of the other and stayed locked into that pattern.  They both had flashing lights on them which then again made us think they were helicopters.  They were flying way to slow and low to be planes, and planes would never fly that close together.  I have seen the Blue Angels perform and they would be the only ones who could pull off a maneuver like that. As we traveled along main street, we intersected with Hwy 23 that runs through town.  Hwy 23 runs east/west and the crafts were flying parallel to the Hwy.  When we reached the intersection (probably 20 seconds from once we first saw the crafts), the traffic light was green for us and we crossed onto Hwy 23 and we were now traveling East on Hwy 23 to Rockville.  Just then the two craft made an abrupt turn to the North East and slowly traveled right over our car.  This is where it gets really strange.  We immediately rolled down our windows to see if we could make out the crafts.  We noticed that there was no noise.  A helicopter at that altitude would sound very loud, but these did not make a sound.  Also, I can’t be 100% sure because it was the end of twilight, but we both thought we saw the shapes of the craft and they looked like triangles.  In addition we saw a dark blue light underneath one of the crafts.  This dark blue light did not flash.  We’ve never seen anything l! ike this before.  We watched as they drifted off towards the northeast.  Very strange.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,45.4732,-94.4124

The sun was still out.  Clear day no clouds.  A few minutes into the drive, maybe 10 miles out of Bakersfield.  I noticed the bright light was still above the freeway and at that time I asked my son, who was in the passenger seat if he saw the bright light.  He stated he had been looking at it for some time now and notice it had not moved.  My younger son who was in the back seat sat forward to see and stated that the light appeared to be hovering over the freeway 99.  We kept looking at the bright light and then as we got closed, noticed now two bright lights and still hovering.  At that point my sons said what is it.  It is not a plane or helicopter.  It is too low and it is not moving.  It appear to be ho! vering over a pass.  I started to slow down to 50 miles and kept looking at the light and notice the cars behind me also slowed down.

My son tried to get a photo with his phone but was not able.  I slowed down to see the object which now was on my right side and hovering over an orchard off the freeway just before the exit.  We were maybe 8 minutes from the Lerdo exit towards Shafter.  We tried to see what it was.  We exited and looked towards my right side above the trees.  As we looked back, it was gone.  No noise.

At approximately 7 am that day, our dog barked and she went to bring him outside.  When she went downstairs, she saw a glowing ¾ orb with a dome top and flat bottom.  It was approximately 2 ft in width and 1.5 ft in height.  The object had two vertical lights inside which blinked green pulsating light.  Facing the object, on our left side, bottom part, the object emitted bursts of very bright white light, some long and some short.  The object was located near a corner wall and appeared to be floating about 5 feet off the ground. My wife started to pray and started to telepathically talk with the object.  My wife thought it was some kind of heavenly angel.  The object seemed to respond by emitting the white bursts and more blinking of the green lights.  She was grabbing our dog at the time, and our dog had just had a stroke and was walking in a paralyzed fashion--  limping to one side real bad and falling down as she walked.  My wife asked if her dog can be cured.  The lights then began to blink a lot. After 15 minutes of observing and communicating with this object, she started to yell for me to come downstairs.  I ignored her cause it was Saturday morning and I did not sleep well the night before and wanted to sleep.  After 5 minutes of her yelling she came up and finally told me what she had seen.  I first went to the bathroom and then downstairs.  I was very skeptical. When I got downstairs, we did not see the orb but a small cylinder shaped object which I am calling a Plasma Cylinder. The object did not appear to have edges but seemed like a fluid object with constant movement inside and on the edges of the object.  Inside were multi-colored lights similar to plasma.  Each color was not unique and separate like a rainbow but more meshed like colored water and the water colors are constantly mixing.  It seemed to be full of energy with colors floating stationary in the air.  The plasma object appeared to be about 1 ft in length and 6” in height.  It was about 5 feet off the ground near the same corner wall that the orb was previously seen.  The object then went directly through our wall to go outside.  I only saw the “Plasma Cylinder” object for about 2 minutes before it disappeared through our wall. Attach is a picture of the ¾ domed orb and the Plasma Cylinder.  We are also attaching a picture of our corner wall.  Please note that the orb/plasma object appeared between the left wall and the flower picture. Our corner wall is on the Western corner of our house.  At 7 am that corner is dark because light does not enter that corner.  We have also closed drapes on the Western window as well and that part was dark because the sun was just rising on the east side.  We know what we saw and it was not an illusion. Also, note that we were going to put our dog to sleep in a few days before this incident--  she could barely move and was walking sideways and constantly falling down.  After the orb left, our dog did not appear to have any symptoms of the stroke--  she was walking perfectly fine.  She is still sick but she now walks fine.  We were freaked out by this.  Many of our friends saw the difference in her walk and we told them what had happened.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829

I saw what I thought was the top of a water tower.  A round almost spherical shape sitting at the height that a water tower would be.   Then I realized that there were no legs under the top of the water tower, which would mean it was hovering.   I told my buddy sitting next to me in the passenger seat and he saw it and thought it was just as out of place as I did. It was a jaw dropping sight to say the least, I almost crashed the car a couple of times.  After observing this thing for a little, we drove around a bend that had some trees and lost our visual on the UFO. When we exited the bend and the trees were gone, the UFO was gone as well.

Last night I was sitting outside, talking on the phone around 9:45 pm, when I noticed this large ball of fire dancing around in the sky at a low altitude. I stared at it for a minute or so, then decided to run inside and grab my husband so he could explain this to me. We live in a neighborhood and have a couple large street pole lights in our neighborhood. We estimated the distance of the flying aircraft to be between 600-1,000 ft above us, and probably an equal distance from us, based on the light poles as a measuring device. This object looked like it was egg/tear dropped shaped it appeared to be about twice as large as the light box on the pole at approx 1,000 feet above us. I don't know how to do the math at a distance like that and be able to provide a rough idea of the size of the aircraft, but that's what it resembled from ground level. It also looked like it was on fire, strange as that sounds, it was a very bright golden/fire color; not a brilliant ! white color. It had several colored lights coming from it. My husband primarily saw red and orange. I saw the full color spectrum in several vertical lines coming from the whole air craft in every direction, in addition to the lights moving horizontally around the aircraft. The primary colors seemed to be Red & Orange. As we watched, it just hovered and moved in circles above us; there was no consistent pattern…it just slowly moved. I have no idea how to guess a speed, but my eyes were able to track it very easily. The lights were very bright and it was a little harder to make out the overall shape of the aircraft at first. There was no noise of an engine or helicopter blades…nothing but silence. We stared at it and watched it move around in a small area of the sky for about 7-10 minutes before it started to drift further South East of us. As it left, heading South East of Battle Ground, it started to climb in altitude and increase its speed.  We saw the whole aircraft “bli! nk” a few times at us (maybe 3 or 4) and then it went really f! ast and all the lights disappeared.  We kept looking up at the sky to try and see if it would reappear again, but it was gone. Before it left, my husband ran into the garage and grabbed a pair of binoculars to try and get a better understanding of this thing; he was unable to bring the binoculars into focus.  We have been discussing this experience since last night and both of us are at a loss for words; especially my husband who retired out of the Air Force recently with 22 years of service. He said he has no idea what that was, he has never seen anything like it. I don’t know if this matters or not, but there was this overall feeling of calmness…I guess I would have expected to be fearful of the unknown, but we were amazingly intrigued by it. When it left, it was almost as though it was saying good-bye with the blinking thing it did.

There are five of us here.  I am using a keyboard that is hard to type on.  We found your site after searching after what we saw last night.  We are one retired PhD scientist, two retired NY media persons, and two currently working media and not for profit people  We are staying at a summer house at Lake Ariel PA.   Last night at 11 PM two of us saw a large red to red orange ellipse move across the sky, slowly with no sound.  It looked like a the tail light of a car and was about 30 times larger than stars or the strobe and other light on airplanes seen in same area/time.  Two of us roused the other three from the house.  By the time they came this orb was fading after moving in a south to east direction farther and farther away.  BUT then, we suddenly saw a formation of five exactly the same orbs coming from the same direction and moving in the same trajectory as the first one.  All five of us watched these five move slowly across the sky, which is a l! arge expanse over the small lake in front of this summer house.  One of us ran inside to find the telescope that this house has.  Eventually by 11:15 or so these five had also moved south to east, fading out as they moved that direction.  Then after about 5 more minutes another, single orb came over, following exactly the same trajectory as the other six.  We all thought all this was extremely strange.  We fiddled with the telescope but could not get a fix before this last orb followed all its predecessors off to the east.  As soon as we got up today we started googling.  We saw a lot of reports including your request.  You can reach us here or me at kurtjohnsonisd@yahoo.com.  We also want to note that the other odd thing last night, though it may have no connection, was that someone in the country neighborhood was shooting off firecrackers in large amount nearby… bang bang bang etc. not a usual thing in these quiet woods, although they were not shooting off any fireworks i! n the sky.  We could just hear all the bangs… or maybe it was ! someone shooting at the orbs.. But we think it was firecrackers…… So two anomalous things last night.  Glad we found all your reports; made us feel we were not imagining what we all saw.  It was pretty memorable.   Also a regular airplane with regular white strobe, red and green light seemed to chase the last orb.

I put the cell away and was just about to cross back over the street to pick up my Pizza when out from behind a cloud to my right I suddenly saw a bright orange burst of light that was so bright it could not be ignored. One orange burning/glowing ball light in the night sky is one thing, but suddenly I saw another, and yet another trailing behind it. I could not believe what I was seeing and before I knew it on the horizon I was seeing them pop up to the North & just West and follow a similar path NW to SW almost as if in a non-linear string formation.  During this time I called my girlfriend who was at our house 6 blocks away and yelled at her to go outside and look up while I frantically tried to snap photographs on my cellphone to no avail due to the overbearing light from street lamps. When I first saw them I thought it could be a meteor, but after the first two and then seeing how fluidly they were moving, with small adjustments in elevation I knew they couldn't be as it wasn't burning up or crashing or dissapating.   Then I thought could be a helicopter, but they were SO bright and 100% SILENT & did not move like helicopters. There were planes in the sky as well during and after the sighting (Milwaukee County Airport traffic) but these lights neither came from the Airport nor headed toward the airport and were way too bright and obvious to be planes or anything else that uses the Airport Terminals. I stayed on the phone with my girlfriend until I had walked the 6 blocks home and by the time I had gotten there all the remaining UFOs were gone, however she had seen them as well, albeit not as many - she ended up seeing 5-7 & even noted that one seemed to turn it's light off and she got sight of the actual shape of the object as seen on the face of a cloud, which was round / spherical - as she put it ""a! lmost 2 spheres in one"". I only lost sight of the remaini! ng 3 &qu ot;fireball"" orbs that I could still see from my perspective once I got about 2 blocks from home and they seemed to have changed direction and were all now traveling more decidedly west than Southwest, however still had a slightly southern trajectory as well. When the sighting was said and done I had seen a ""fleet"" of these lights - about 12-15 very strong & bright glowing orange orbs moving across the Milwaukee night sky over Milwaukee's East Side near the University of Milwaukee Wisconsin. I lost sight of the remaining objects the same way I lost sight of the first 8 or 9... as they flew south past my point of view, they headed hard west & disappeared into cloud cover at this point. You could see them climbing up into the clouds quickly once they reached them and fading out of view in less than a minute. These objects were completely silent, very bright, seemingly moving as a large group / unit but with their own variances & at least 5-10 orb lengths between! each object. I felt calm, dumbfounded and not really frantic quite frankly but rather at ease. I remember that my only concern was that my girlfriend who was only a few blocks away get outside and confirm what I was seeing from that perspective as well (looking south as I was seeing them come from the north), so I was ecstatic when she answered and when I heard her reaction over the phone when she looked up. I had a feeling in my chest, slightly emotional and my eyes were wired open as well as a feeling of calm.

I was laying down on the back of my truck, looking at the clouds.  It was a beautiful day, the sky was bright blue. I was watching birds flying by and then I began looking at the vast blue of the sky.  As my eyes adjusted to changing depths, an object caught my eye. It was a very small white orb. It appeared to be either emitting its own light, or reflecting the Sun's.  This is because it kept a constant color. At first I thought it might be a star or planet, since I'm quite unexperienced with object of the sky. However, the longer I watched it, the more I realized how high in the sky it actually was.  This was in contrast to passing planes, which looked very small from my perspective, and were still obviously lower than the object.  I know this because at one point, the object moved behind some clouds that were passing by.  At this point I really noticed how erratic its movement was; it slowed down and sped up; it was also moving in different directions. As I was! watching this first object, I saw another one very close to it.  This one was moving much faster in the same direction as the first one, and there was yet another one following that one at the same speed.  It appeared as if the third one was chasing the second one, as they were moving erratically. After around 8 minutes, they were all completely covered by a passing cloud, and by the time it passed and I could see the blue background again-  I had lost all sight of the orbs. Keep in mind all of this was occurring at a very high altitude and in a very small zone of the sky, as the objects looked extremely small from ground level. Although the objects were moving extremely fast (much faster than any airplane that was passing by AND they were farther up), they were not making a scene. I myself have near perfect vision and unless I was concentrating perfectly on the level of altitude they were in, they would blur away and disappear. It happened a few times if I looked in another direction, finding them again was a matter of focusing on very small spots on the sky and looking for motion in the peripherals. This leads me to believe that UFOs are more common than we think during the day, yet they are so difficult to spot. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The witnesses were myself, my wife’s brother, my wife’s father, 2 other adults, and a teenager. We were attending the high school graduating ceremony of my wife’s nephew who was graduating from Forest Lake Academy in Apopka, Florida.  The lengthy graduation ceremony was almost finishing and I wanted to get some air and stepped outside of the auditorium.  We were located on a small hill about 300 feet north of state road 436 just west of state road 434.  Thus, the orbs were very close, about 300 feet away, and the visibility was excellent. All of the witnesses began to see bright yellow orbs rising from approximately the interchange of road 436 and 434 from about tree level.  We could not see them coming from the ground but appeared to “pop out” at the tree level.  They appeared to travel in a westerly direction along road 436 just south of it.  The orbs appeared about every 1-2 minutes.   Most were uniform in direction and most went west and upwards slowly, I would guess at 10-20 mph.  Some began to float straight up and others moved faster (30-40 mph) than others. The orbs then became distant and disappeared.  This lasted from approximately 9 pm to about 9:20 pm.  About 10 minutes later, two black helicopters came zooming in at a fast rate.  They stopped on top of route 436 just south of Bear Lake Road (about ½ mile from where we were).  They stayed there about 10-15 minutes and then left.  The orbs had disappeared when they arrived.

I went out to the balcony to shake out a rug, and as is my habit, I scanned the sky to admire the view. I live on the 4th floor here in Koganei, a suburb in Far West Tokyo and have a great view. I can see Mt. Fuji and have an almost 180 view facing West. It was about 5-5:30 PM and I saw in the distance, location at about 11, a glowing orange ball. It was very tiny, and at first I thought it was a plane reflecting the light o the sun. I have seen that before, but turns out that wasn’t it. I went back in to the apartment to replace the rug and came back outside to look at the orange ball. It looked like a plane that was on fire, falling from the sky, but very slowly. It continued on the same path, and it seemed to get larger. No smoke though, and only a slight glowing trail behind it. I continued to watch it for another few minutes and it kept getting bigger. It was coming in from the SE to NE direction, all silent. It was still quite far away, but obviously glowing and not a plane. I got binoculars, the good ones, and it was an orange ball of light. No plane visible. I called my husband out to look, and he said it must be a plane, but it really didn’t look like the planes he has seen, so he said it must be reflecting the sun. He doesn’t believe in strange things in the sky, but as I continued to watch it,  and nag him about looking, too, he came out and said, well, it could be  meteorite or maybe a satellite burning as it fell. He went back inside, nothing more for him. I stayed and watched it and then it made a turn ! A left turn, and it appeared to head due West. At that point I knew it was neither a meteor nor falling satellite, so maybe it was a plane. Back to the binoculars – still orange, still a ball, but got smaller and smaller until it finally disappeared. I have no idea what I saw, but it was lovely and exciting all the same. My background is as a professional international educator. I am 60, female, and a watcher of the sky. I believe you will never see anything if you don’t look up.

On my way home from work on Monday, May 21, 2012 at about 9:40 PM, I was driving west on West Line Street just past Barlow lane, heading to my home which is north of Bishop. It is a fairly dense residential area. Suddenly, through the trees to the north, my attention was drawn to a very bright red light. It outshown every other light in view. Since it was low, no more than a hundred yards off the ground, I was confused by what I was seeing. At first, I thought it was a light on top of some radio tower, but there isn't any such tower in the area. Then, I could see it was slowly moving in my direction. I thought it was too low to be an aircraft, and I have never seen such a bright red light on an aircraft. I slowed my car, and watched intently as the light passed over the trees and into the clear sky above me. It passed slowly over the two-lane road on which I was driving, no more than two or three hundred feet in front of and above me. I would estimate it's speed as no more than ten to fifteen miles per hour. What had first appeared as a solid red light wasn't solid at all.  It was a spherical object, made up of a geometric assembly of very bright red lights, each apparently identical and equally bright. The lights didn't blink on and off, and did not vary in intensity.  I would estimate the size of the sphere as no more than ten or fifteen feet in diameter, about the size of a small car, and as it moved, it was quite clear that the lights were evenly spaced, geometrically all around the sphere.  I counted five lights on one hemisphere. It looked like some kind of huge lighted Christmas ornament. And it was beautiful. I was amazed and completely awe-struck by what I was watching. I pulled the car to the side of the road, stopped and rolled down the window, which provided a clear and distinct view of the sphere, which was by now no more than 200 feet away. I was able to estimate its height and distance by comparing it to trees alongside the road. It was completely silent, seemingly floating in the air. It continued it's southward course, and as it passed by, the rear of the object came into view. I was struck by how evenly spaced the lights were all around the outside of the sphere. The red lights had an intense, radiant quality. They were very bright, and I could make out each individual light. It was like a ball of evenly-spaced red lights. My view to the south was completely clear, unobstructed by trees or buildings. I watched the sphere as it continued slowly south for perhaps a half-mile, clearly silhouetted against the dark night sky.  The red lights remained on.  Then, it accelerated abruptly, and moved up so quickly that it disappeared in the darkness.  There was nothing left to see but the stars.  The entire episode lasted about two minutes, perhaps less. I looked at the clock in my car when I first realized what I was seeing, and again after the object disappeared. I wasn't drinking, or under the influence of any substance.  I have never seen anything like it.  I am convinced that it wasn't any kind of aircraft; not an airplane, or a helicopter, or any kind of balloon.  There was no wind, and absolutely no sound whatsoever.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,37.496172413793104,-118.31717241379312

Hello this night I was at the El Dorado Lake, Bolder Bluff area. I was sitting in a chair that sort of leans back and has a foot rest, watching the stars,(I'm a bit of an amature astronomer). I know my stars, and my planes very well. I know what planes are at what air force bases in the area and what there capable of doing. I love physics and military info. I don't believe in aliens, at least not ones near our solar system. I'm sure, as most scientist are, that life exists somewhere in the Galaxy. It's ridiculas not to. This light I thought was a star of about a magnitude six and was white in color and did not blink or flash like most planes do. It was in the eastern sky, and then it moved west it and very fast. Which is why I really noticed it. I thought it was a satellite until it stopped on a dime, and then changed directions, looping north then back on the same east to west heading. Only to stop again, and do a circle, stop and hover for a few seconds and after that it was back on the same heading. This repeated several times. It lasted so long my neck hurt the next day,(I had gotten up to turn off my lanturn), when I tried to retrive my binoculars I lost it of course! It was very intriguing and i kept an eye out for it. Then I caught it in the northwestern sky headed southeast doing the same type of movements. The light finally disapeared in the southwestern sky. The duration was from 9:15 to 9:32. The light was traveling at about the speed of a satillite or faster but was brighter than most. It had to be some type of craft, it could not have been a star, satillite, or any aircraft I know of obviously. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this, and I believe it to be a secret military craft. That is up for interpretation. I have been vidulant at looking for this light since that night,(9/20/2012) to no avail though. There were four planes during that time period that I noticed. All of which were headed on a east west heading, probably to and from Wichita, KS. Two headed east and two west. I'd love to see the radar reports from that night if at all possible. Someone had to see this light, either on radar or visually. It was perfectly clear sky, and pretty much has been every night since. If anyone had seen this also please report it. I could not believe the speed at which the light was traveling or how it could just stop and loop or do perfect right angle corners. This was no illusion, I'm not insane, actually I have a very high IQ. And it makes my a little angry the way people look at me when I tell them about it.

Before doing so I stood there to enjoy a cool breeze, and the sound of crickets.  Facing north in the doorway, I noticed to the left of me 5 large amber lights that just came from the south side my house. The lights formed a wide V - (/\), or in the shape of a boomerang, and silently moved in a northerly direction.  The speed was approximately 10-20 MPH and the height was just above the tree-line.  The sky was clear, and some of the lights on the side closes to me flickered a few times.  All of the lights moved in unison, and I could not make out a clear solid object. Once it reached the street, the left side moved over the light.  What I was able to see on that side was definition, but with no solidity.   It was strange; I could only see edges and not a solid mass.  So in other words, the side lite by the street light was like an object with no sides and the other side was black. I was! scared, and excited at the same time. I tried to call my girlfriend, but while I was fumbling with the phone in the dark and looking for my shoes to run to the road I dropped it.  Once I did get outside, and ran to the end of my walk, I saw two of my neighbors who hadn’t been out earlier.  I asked them both if either one of them saw something in the sky.  They both replied “no,” they too had just come out with their dogs.  I reported it to MUFON right away while my memory was clear. I was so baffled by what I saw I couldn't sleep.  Since its properties were somewhat invisible other than the lights.  One theory worth reckoning is it could have been manufactured with a shell made with something like Goldbeaters Skin.  Goldbeater’s skin is made from cow innards.  The quality is one of transparency and strength. I think they used it back in the early 1900’s airships like the German zeppelins.  Maybe that would explain the cow mutilations?  Whatever it was, it was also sighted the next day hovering over the municipal airport at 1pm and later that night by a woman and her son. Their sighting was at approximately 7:30 pm.  She said the object was hovering over the school and looked somewhat transparent and had five to six lights.  I have not been able to get them to fill out a report on MUFON.  This whole deal is a little unnerving and I need to make some sense out of what I saw.  I called the airport, and the police. No one reported seeing anything.  I am hoping it did not see me.  I don’t think I want it to! come back. Since I have no control over this situation it is a little frightening.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,41.3832,-89.1461

It was a perfectly circular craft with many lights of all colors. The lights seemed to be only on the underside, and were of all colors and flashed or pulsed, and it seemed to rotate, or at least the lights themselves were flashing on and off to give the illusion of rotation. The craft appeared to be very close to the ground, and viewing it through an old crab-apple tree that probably stood about 60 feet, it seemed to be very near to touching the top branches of that tree.  Given the distortion of that memory in the 35 years that has passed, my 10 year old mind at the time of the event providing further questionability as to the accuracy of my recollection, and the existence of that tree as a reference providing support for my conclusion, I would estimate that the craft was approximately 30 to 60 feet in diameter. To my astonishment, my grandmother refused to discuss the incident when my parents returned home a few hours later, and took the details of the incident to her grave some 30 years later.  The baby sitter flatly denied that anything out of the ordinary had happened, possibly in fear of losing future baby sitting jobs. My brother also refused to talk, although I managed to pry an acknowledgement of the event from him decades later. Several days after the incident, the local AM radio station, WGHQ ran a news story about a local man who had invented the first circular aircraft.  My mom made a point of bringing my attention to that radio broadcast.  At 10 years old, even my immature brain led me to the conclusion that this was some type of cover-up.  I don't know exactly what I saw that night, but the existence of that radio broadcast makes me ponder that event some 35 years later.  And to this day I have never seen another circular aircraft.

I was a young boy apox 11-12 years old. It was toward the of the end of summer as the days were beginning to get shorter. I remember playing in the front yard. I lived in the Oaks. Its mostly mid-class families. The sky was gray and somewhat cool as it gets in Texas towards the evening time. I was on the corner of where our yard where we lived at Briar Oaks and well the cross street was Carter Creek, well it turns into Carter Creek at the Curb by the Royal Oaks Racket Club use to be. I saw a Bright light hovering above our yard. It as I could tell somewhat oval shaped as the light resemble a floucent light color but much brighter. I describe it as oval shape as that was how the light extended. I watched it for- it felt like a long time probably between 10 to 15 min. It didn't appear to be very high maybe 1 to 2 football fields high. I wanted to get a ladder and get a closer look. After several minutes of watching it, I remember my neck hurting from staring into the sky for so long. There was no sound and the craft was just hovering with No moment. I remember running inside a telling my mom. I ask if we had some binoculars to get a closer look. She said ""No"" we didn't. I told her she had to come outside to see it. Once back outside it was gone. Later that night I remember telling my mom that we had to watch KBTX Channel 3 to see if anyone else saw it. The weather man did say something. I thought that was awesome. He stated that several other people called in that night about a bright light in the sky. He laughed, joking and said we all hope it was just a weather balloon with no real explanation. I hope someone in that neighorhood who saw what I did will also post there experience that day. I am very surpised with the number of calls the news recieved no one else has placed anything on this website. I am currently 34 years old and been serving in the US Army for over 15 years. Everything from that day has kept me wondering for a very long time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in 1979.

My wife and I went outside for a smoke after watching a movie and noticed a bright blueish oval light directly above us.  It was moving from south to north and then dimmed down to a small redish light and then disappeared all together.   We walked into our yard and to the west just above our house was the same bluish orb again.  It was slowly moving to the east now and seemed to jump back and forth zig zaging as it moved.  We watched this for about 30 min until it went behind some trees and we were unable to see it anymore.    Also when it was about midway across the sky we heard a neighbor yell look at that.  Not sure where the neighbor was but it was extreamly quit that night and you could hear a pin drop so not sure if they were close to us or not but it sounded like they were.   About this time my wife looked up into the sky and said look at them all.  Just above us south of the blusish orb were what looked like thousands of stars moving in all different dire! ctions.  They seemed to be following this cloud formation that was moving north.  What was odd was there was no wind that night and you could not hear anything in the sky.   I said if it was a plane we would hear it and also planes flash.  Just as quickly as those lights apeared they all seemed to disapear.  I made the comment I think there moving with the clouds.  My wife then got real scared and ran into the house to make sure the kids were OK.   We had just an overall feeling of uneasyness that kept me looking out the windows for the rest of the night until the sun came up.   This happened about 2:30 am on June 9th,2012-08-05T00:00:00,,

Luminosity was brilliant on each occasion.  The first seen object (19th June) travelled in a West to East direction (in bound above Gozo island across Mellieha Bay (Malta).  The floowing objects (19th & 20th June 2012) were stationary over Gozo Island (not on the incoming civilian aircraft landing path to Malta International Airport) before moving off in a Northly direction out to sea at a rapid speed. The height of 'fireballs' was very difficult to estimate.  Speed much faster than any type of civilian aircraft. There was no engine noise heard whatsoever.  There were no flashing aircraft red/green/white lights. The brilliance of the 'fireballs remained' constant. The estimated distance covered from point of first visual sighting to point of disappearing from view was a! pproximately fifteen miles in less than five minutes. On each three nights/early morning numerous witnesses 'tourists andlocals' watched the 'firballs' travelling across the sky.  The 'fireballs' seemed to be at first diamond shaped and intermitently split into a group of three seperate 'fireballs moving together at equal distand (to the human eye approximately 2.5 centimetres apart) and several moments later re-joined into a whole object.  The 'fireballs were observed by my wife and I from our roof top garden in Mellieha, Malta.  We are not UFO and have no interest as such in the subject. At first we thought the lights were approaching aircraft to land at Malta International airport, We are used to observning normal aircraft coming and going from the Malta international airport. The objects (fireballs) were not usual civilian aircaft and they moved as tough under intelligent control and certainly were not caused by natural weather conditions, weather ballons, chinese lanterns! , fireworks or any other 'ridiculous' explanations. If uiindee! d the se en objects were military aircraft, they were exceptionally quiet and very luminous in the night sky, which was cloudless. There wss no wind and the breeze was travelling (East to West) in the opposite direction against the movement of the objects. The ambient temperature was approximatly twenty six degree's centigrade on each night of the sighting with an avergae 58 % humidity measurement. This is the first time these strange lights have been reported. However, there has been and are seen (usually innthe night sky but some day time 'disc' sighting have also have been observed) increasing sightings being observed over the island of Malta and neighbouring Sicily.

At about 11:30 we saw a very strange big bright oval light hovering in the sky. It looked too bright and big to be any ordinary plane or helicopter.  We captured a photo of it and video and in the photo if you zoom in you can distinctively see it is a large oval and is a orange and yellow light.  At the time there was no sound of a air plane or helicopter and it was too close to be a star.  It hovered with two small dots in the sky for about ten minutes and then it started to move away and suddenly disappeared. My friend and I discussed it for quite a long time trying to figure it out debating what we had just witnessed.  There was ultimately no explanation for what we had seen.  It just sat there in the sky hovering for ten minutes and it was the most bright unusual thing I had ever seen.  It almost looked like the sun but obviously smaller.  We showed what we ca! ptured to multiple people and they all agreed that was no plane nor helicopter.,2012-09-24T00:00:00,42.192600000000006,-72.4598

Upon further inspection and double checking my skyview and google sky to make sure I was not mistaken I noticed it growing brighter and flashing bright white and red light. The following night I went out to see if it was in the same place as I still wanted to rule out anything explainable. It was not. As I turned around to walk back to the house I saw what appeared to be the same thing now over the mountain near me. After watching it hover and then slowly descend behind the mountain I knew it really was a UFO. The following night I went out to look at the mountain at the same time, it was not there of course. This cemented my conviction that it had been the same or similiar type UFO both nights. I tried to capture it with my phone and camera but they were not powerful enough in the dark. Over the next two weeks I found this thing hovering in the sky but in different places nearly every night, just as if it was watching us. Often moving but the movement was so slow you would have to be watching it for a while to notice it. It seemed to be trying to appear as a star, and it would drift just as the sky appears to throughout the night. However, to a person that knows the stars and the night sky it's movement is not as it should be if it really was a star. A week ago I decided I just had to try to get one of these on film so I went out and purchased a new Nikon camera with a telephoto lense. Happily I finally  did a couple nights ago on August 21st as they came up right at dusk. During the past week there appears to be the main craft which is brighter and/or closer to earth along with two like it that seem either smaller or more distant. I did post a youtube video of the the pics I got. They aren't the best but I am going to try to get more. Hopefully I find others who are seeing this craft in the Washington skies as well.

We were in the Bellevue Wisconsin Home Depot parking lot putting our purchases into the truck when we saw 5 lights in the west flying in kind of a v or check mark formation.  My husband is a pilot and so of course interested in planes, we thought the formation was probably some kind of military planes or helicopters and we stopped to watch it.  We quickly noticed that there was no noise, if these were military jets or helicopters we would be able to hear them a good distance away, but there was no sound.  As we continued to watch, the lights did not change in size though they did move from the west and then turned to the north.  Behind these initial 5 came more and more, single file low over the city and then they would turn north and continue until they were out of our site.  These lights were not perfectly spaced, but they came one after another and we could see them coming from some distance away.  It was not like these were just coming up over a building into sight; we could see them far in the distance come closer in a straight line, then turn north and eventually out of sight.  We did not keep an exact count, and as some would go out of sight we could see more coming, but we saw at a minimum 30, more likely 40 of these yellowish round non blinking lights move across the sky.  The sky was clear, mostly dark with the west horizon still reddish from the sun set, but stars were visible in the sky.  As we were standing there watching the lights, we noticed a light in the sky moving toward us from NW to SE.  As we looked at it we could tell that it was triangle shaped, but it was not airplane shaped.  We could not see stars behind it, it blocked the sky in a full triangle shape.  My husband being a pilot immediately noticed that while it did have blinking lights at the three triangle points, there was no belly strobe.  We could see the blinking belly strobe on other airliners high in the sky but not on this. Whatever was flying over us was large, completely silent and flying very slow and low.  My husband estimates that the aircraft was flying approximately 3000 feet off the ground, well less than 5000 ft. Our background:  We are both in our 40’s, employed full time in white collar jobs, we have two children ages 10 and 12, we were completely sober, not a drop to drink that night. My father is a very active private pilot, and while my husband does not have a current license he graduated from the North America Institute of Aviation in Las Cruces, NM in May 1991 with his Commercial Pilot license and CFI rating.  We are both familiar with aircraft and whatever we saw that night, we cannot explain.   This was the most bizarre experience we have ever had.  When the lights stopped, we got in the truck to drive home and I immediately called my dad (8:49pm CST) to see if he knew of any kind of aviation event going on in the area that might explain what we saw, but he did not.  When we got home I called the news stations (WBAY 920-438-3264 at 9:06pm)  (WFRV 800-236-5550 9:11pm) (WLUK 920-490-1407 9:28pm) and while no one knew what we saw, we were not the only ones who called.  The news stations said they had received multiple calls and it seems they were all from the same Bellevue/East Green Bay area we were in.  I called the Green Bay non emergency police number (920-391-7450 9:13pm).  While talking to the woman who answered my call, she said she needed to put me on hold for 911, I thought she was transferring me to 911 so I hung up.  A few minutes later (9:18pm) my phone rang, and it was the police calling me back, she explained that she had to put me on hold so she could take a 911 call.  She completed taking my information and! said they would get in contact with the airport and investigate.  I asked if it was possible to get any follow-up as I would love to have an explanation for what we saw, but she said she transferred the information to her supervisor and she would not know the outcome.  So far we have seen nothing in the news regarding what we saw, but we would love an explanation.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,44.52863971962617,-88.04377663551402

I worked in Salisbury and lived in Warminster (30min drive).  I came over a brow of a hill (at the top of the hill) which then went around to the right.  There just starting to cross over the road right to left was a UFO.  It was at lampost height, as long as a bus and the best way to descibe it is; similar to some of the pictures you see being drawn of them, a flying saucer.  It was going very slow and it was that low I braked and stopped the car.  I then sat there and watch it cross over.  (It was country side either side of the road).  It had port holes/windows on the middle section with lights that could be seen inside.  But there was a very distintive thing about it and that was the noise. It made a very deep intermitted humming noise, which at a guess must have been its engines.  Being so close there was no mistaken the fact on what it was.

Thanks for spending the time to inform your neighbours. I approached you after your presentation and you asked me to write down my question and send it to you.  So, here goes.   I remember an incident where we were uncertain about what we witnessed.   Unfortunately I don’t remember the year this event happened but it may correspond with other reports in your records. Approximately 30 years ago my family and I were camping at Steamboat State Park on Banks Lake.  Steamboat State Park is a large campground; even 30 years ago it had a capacity of 100 or more campsites.  I do remember that it was at an annual family reunion that is always scheduled for the first week of August.  Late in the warm clear summer evening somewhere around 11 pm we finished playing a card game and left our screen tent.  Our entire group immediately noticed what appeared to be an odd looking ""vapour trail"" in the sky.  It ran from the SE to the NW.  We are all accustomed to seeing vapour trails that are created by jet planes but this one was very different.   It appeared to be much lower in elevation and seemed to generate its own green tinted light.   We know that a vapour trail may pick up light from some other source and reflect it.  To our estimation there was no green tinted light source that would illuminate this trail in the air.   The trail reached from one horizon to the other and was of a consistent color and intensity. This vapour trail was so unusual that within a few minutes’ people all over the campground were stirring from their campers and tents to view it.  We remember that people were waking their sleeping children to see it.  Many people were so alarmed by it that they went to their vehicles and were scanning the radio stations to see if something dramatic had happened.   Over the next half hour an atmosphere of alarm and fear was felt in the entire campground.  It eventually dissipated and people began to settle down. I have no idea of what happened or what caused the trail in the sky, never heard any explanation.   If there is some connection with a sighting in that area I would be interested in knowing. Thanks for your time, keep up the good work. ((name deleted)) Davenport, WA 509-725-3765",2012-10-30T00:00:00,,

During December, 1983, at or around 8:00PM.  Myself age 13, and 3 other adults were on the terrace of our two story house.  It was a pleasant night and we were looking up while lying down on patio lounge chairs.  In the clear night sky appeared around 20 or more very intensely bright white stars.  They appeared suddenly, one after the other, some would pop out of existing ones; almost as if someone had turned on a light switch and a light bulb was turned on.  They were all white globes in appearance, closely resembling the brightest stars in the sky, but without the telltale blinking of a star.  At first there simply hovering at what I consider to be the height of a high flying airliner.  After the last one appeared, they organized themselves into a square formation, a very precise flying formation.  Soon after, they started flying very slowly away from our observation post.  They suddenly stopped before they were to disappear from our field of view and started to do what I can only describe as flight maneuvers, such as what the Blue Angels would do; all in a tight formation.  It's interesting to note that they would suddenly stop and make very quick turns; all in formation.  After about 20 minutes of this, they disappeared in the very same way that they appeared: they suddenly extinguished themselves.  It's interesting to note that we had an AM radio playing music at the time, but there seemed to be very heavy interference while these objects were in the sky.  I would also like to note that there was a heavy military operation being conducted in the country, but I would not be able to say if that was in any way related to what I saw.  I am not claiming what I saw were UFO's, but I had never, and have never since, seen anything of that sort. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It was recently revived when my brother-in-law who I did not know in the early 80’s told a story that matched mine identically. In 1981 or ’82, I was standing on our front porch in Missouri talking to my son and a friend who were about 12 at the time.  It was after dark and the weather was warm.  Suddenly, we became aware of something above us and I don’t recall any noise.  It was a starry, clear night but we looked up and could see no stars directly above us even though we could still see stars towards all the horizons.  There were lights traveling in a triangular formation so at first we thought that three planes were moving slowly from the southwest to the northeast.  We finally realized that the lights were outlining a huge single triangle shape which was blocking the stars from our view.  It lasted only a few minutes before it moved slowly beyond the tree line, but was long enough for us to discuss it.  Afterwards everything returned to a clear starry night.  We wondered if it was an experimental craft from a nearby military installation but thought it was too large to be anything we had ever hea! rd about. Recently, my son’s friend who is now the CEO of a corporation asked if I remembered that night and our encounter with a UFO.  Then my brother-in-law recounted the time in the early 80’s when he was dining at a table by a corner window in an exclusive restaurant on the 22nd floor of a building in a nearby city.  It was a clear starry night when suddenly he became aware of something moving towards the building from the southwest that was triangular and enormous.  It blocked the night sky and had lights at the points of the triangle.  He and his party thought it was going to collide with the building but it moved over the building and all returned to normal.

It was winter, and my best friend (and neighbor) and I were sledding in their orchard behind their house.  We had just sledded to the bottom of a hill and were lying in the snow looking up at the sky, when an object that looked like a low flying airplane flew into sight above us.   We both stared at it. The object obviously came to a stop right above us and we had a great opportunity to view the lights around the craft, I believe they were yellow, red, green and possibly blue. They blinked on and off at different times, almost appearing that one light could blink different colors.  It scared us, as we had never seen an airplane just stop like that before.  Then, the wings seemed to fold back into the craft and it darted off very quickly and appeared to crash in a draw in the nearby hills. We ran for her house as fast as our legs would carry us through the snow. Her mother instantly knew something was wrong, and listened to our frantic recaps of what we had just seen.  It bothered her enough that she called the police. Two police officers arrived at her house a short while later, and one took my friend into a room and one took me into a different room, out of earshot of each other.  They had us each tell them what we saw, and draw pictures of it.  Afterwards, the cops compared our stories and pictures, which were identical. This was before cell phones, and I distinctly remember the one cop asking to use the home phone to make a few phone calls.  I was able to overhear some of what he said, he was checking to see if anyone had special test flights going on, and no one did.  He also confirmed no planes were in the area and that no planes were reported missing and/or crashed. They then sent a crew up to the hills and they said they combed the entire hillside we pointed them to, and never found a single thing.  And that was the last I ever heard about it. To this day, I can still picture what we saw.  It haunts me.   Maybe it was a UFO, maybe it was some special craft that was being tested that was classified, or maybe we hit our heads while sledding - though that is unlikely.  All I know is I have never seen or heard of anything like it since then. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I’m retired from Law Enforcement of (10) years. I then moved into State Government work for (28) years.  After retirement I stepped back into Government work as a consultant. I worked as a Volunteer Asst. Fire Chief for (24) years. I was also a member of the Bomb & Arson squad in my county. Lets start by the date!   On Jan. 5, 2000 I was at a nearby township investigating a house fire. At around 3:15 a.m. I walked back to my truck to clean off all the dirt from my boots and turn out gear. I stated listening to the Two-Way Radio in my truck. We where picking up radio traffic from the  ILL area.  The ILL Co. dispatcher was talking to some Police cars about a object moving North East heading for the St. Louis, MO area. After about a half hour, I was still on the fire scene I stated heading home on I-44. That’s when I picked up our county dispatcher talking to a Union, MO Police Officer about a large object over Hwy. 50 & Hwy. 47.  I turned down Hwy. 47 towards Union, MO. As I came over the hill into town I saw three white lights about 75-100 ft. apart from each other. In between the round white lights there were multicolored-color lights scrolling back and fourth from left to right and back again. I came down the hill and pulled up behind two Police Officers parked on the side of the road. I then could see a very large triangle shaped craft with more lights on the bottom of the craft. One very bright white light in each corner & one red light in the center towards the back of the craft. The white lights where beaming straight down. The red light was blinking on & off like a radio tower light.  I got out my truck and started walking up to the Police Officers. One officer was from the City of Union, MO the other was a Franklin Co. Deputy. Just as I got up to them the craft started to move off to the north east at about a very fast running speed.  The two officers got in their cars and started to chase the craft. I was unable to keep up with the two officers. They where using their overhead lights. So, after a minute or so, I caught up to them. I got out of the truck again and walked up to the officers. The craft had stopped again about a mile up the road. As we were watching, the bright spotlight type lights in each corner came down to about 100 feet from the ground and stopped. No light beam touched the ground. We watched the craft for about 10-mins. Then the craft moved again. This time only about ½-mile and stopped again. After stopping and getting out to talk with officers again, I noticed the County officer was trying to talk to the dispatcher by two-way radio. I have a portable two-way radio with me and could not pick-up any radio traffic from the County or the officer in front of me. I need to mention that the craft was directly overhead and about 500 ft. high. The craft was also the width of a football field. The sides in some parts of the craft where about 10-ft. at the corners and moved up to about 20-ft. in the center, making it curved on top and flat across the bottom. As this craft moved again all radio traffic returned to normal. We again could hear the dispatcher over in ILL talking. As the craft moved off for the third time, the County officer looked at both of us and said “I another call pending” got back in to his car and drove off! So the Union office told me he was to far out of the city limits,  “I don’t see a thing” and got back in his car, turned around on old Hwy. 100 and drove off. I watched the craft move off until I could not see the lights any longer. It was moving cross country and there were only private roads & driveways. I then got back into my truck and drove home. At the second stop the county officer was trying to set his dash camera in the up direction, but it was bolted in and would not turn.  I waited for weeks to see this story in the news paper or on the TV news, but no one file a report.  Do to the fact I didn’t have a Police report to fall back on, I decided not to talk to anyone about this sighting.  Now that I’m retired and this craft keeps showing up in Missouri, I thought I would bring this story to light. Hopefully, this will help out investigators in the future.

I was watching it for a few seconds thinking it was a plane. I quickly realized at the altitude and how bright the lights were we should have easily seen flashing lights.  Once I saw this I yelled at everyone else to tell me what it was.  Their first reaction was a plane.  I told them if it was wouldn't there be flashing lights. They starting staring at it and we all knew it was not a plane! We watched it go threw the sky for awhile in a straight path. It started to raise and the light started to dim. So we thought it could be a plane rising in the sky. The light ended up comp! letely disappearing but where it disappeared at there is no way a plane would no longer be seen.

The day had been sunny and warm, with the temps in the high 80’s, that evening we had no breeze, it was very still.  We had some light cloud cover from a “dry” cold front which was moving in sometime for early morning.    My husband and I were watching TV in our Family Room.  I happen to look out and up and it appeared out of nowhere through the light, thin clouds, just above the roof of our house. Immediately I asked my husband if he’d seen it and told him, you’ve got to see this.  I quickly jumped out of my chair, and ran out our front door, with my husband right behind me.  It took us seconds, maybe 15 seconds at the most maybe, to get from the chair inside, out into the front yard.  It had changed from taking a straight line North direction in between the time it took for us to get out into our  front yard, by then it had had already taken a NE direction away from us toward Johnstown.  It moved very quickly and appeared to be already halfway at a distance away from us.   It was a bright orange molten ball of light, glowing with orange energy waves which were pulsating from the top of  it.  A gas line exploded several years ago a little ways up on the main street we live off of, this object was just as bright or brighter orange than that, the evening the gas line exploded.  My husband told me it appeared to be large to him. We never seen anything like it before.  We knew everything it was not.  It was not a meteor, it had no tail, it was not moving fast enough to be a meteor.  It was not pulsating bright orange energy waves like a ”Chinese Lantern“ would.  It was not a stationary star, a shooting star or a falling star, there was a half moon that evening and it was just starting to rise in the west.   As it was moving away from us, it never made any noise, or sound, it was totally  silent.  As we were watching this object heading ! away from us, there was a small plane in the sky at the same t! ime.  We heard a small airplane which was heading toward us from the North moving in a Southerly direction, it had the normal appearance of  an airplane with the white headlight and a blinking red~blue marking lights.  It is very common and something we’ve become very familiar with from evening airplane traffic.   We have constant airplane traffic both day and night, from private and commercial aircraft, going to and fro from Port Columbus.  We watched the object until it disappeared.  Our encounter lasted approximately 3-3 1/2 minutes",2012-08-05T00:00:00,40.1616,-82.6541

I asked her if she was talking about the radio tower in the distance. She said no and we got up to look out the back window. Looking out there was a red/orange light rising from the horizon strait up. I know it was strait up because the light never got smaller or larger it stayed at about ¼” all the way till it hit the roofline and I could not see it any more. (This took about 45 seconds to rise to this height.) My wife decided to look out the side window and there it was now moving northeast towards the east side of Cleveland. By the time I got to the window (had to get back out of bed) it was about ½ way across the sky we watched it for about another 7 seconds getting smaller and smaller until it was so far away we could not see it any more. (Total from the point my wife got to the window until it was out of sight was about 25 seconds tops. And the distance between the back and side windows is about 15 feet and might take about 5 seconds to move between with the obstacles) Now to be completely honest with my feelings about the fact I cannot say what this was I do not believe in ET’s/aliens. I think it would be incredibly cool for another race to come to earth and tell us that we are headed in the wrong direction and we better fix our ways or they will. Even leave some of their race here to show the retared people of world what we are doing wrong. Get rid of our bombs/weapons and show us a better way. But I am a Christian who believes God made us in his image and we are his greatest creation and I will believe in aliens when I actually see one in person or they declassify real pictures of a real spacecraft.

Definitely not lightning and lots more flashes in a row than you'd expect from lightning.  Also sometimes emanated from down low as though coming from down near the ground, which had a thin layer of fog across it in the low-lying areas.  Made us think of swamp/marsh gas or ""will o' the wisp""  in folklore.   We could only assume it was the Northern Lights but it was solid white and sometimes coming from down low instead of on the distant horizon which was freaky. When we got to the lodge where we stayed in Cranbrook the first night we asked the manager about it and whether it could be the Northern Lights.  She looked absolutely perplexed and said no, you can't generally see the Northern Lights from here, she's lived there 10 years and never seen them.

These objects appeared much bigger and brighter than the other stars in the sky though.  I then noticed the disc shaped object.  It was hovering in the night sky a large distance away (maybe 3-5 miles). The 3 objects were in a triangular formation, but were many miles apart. The “tracking” objects were hovering parallel to interstate I70 (maybe .5 miles north of the interstate) about half way in between the Mt Comfort and Greenfield exits. The “main” object appeared to be north of the other 2 objects in the direction of the Mt Comfort Airport.  The disc shaped object was lighting up with what appeared to be tracer lights going around the middle of the saucer from left to ! right and then back right to left.  The lights were green and red (going from green to yellowish orange to red in color as they moved).  It hovered for about 5 minutes.  I then saw a flash, almost like a blue light beam shot out for a split second. I kept watching it and I saw at least one more quick beam.  Then I noticed the object tilt. It tilted to an upright position and the lights then ran north to south.  I know it sounds crazy, but I almost swore I could see something in the beam going towards the object.  It hovered like this for another 5 minutes or so. I then had to go to work, so I stopped watching the main UFO and watched the 2 “tracking” objects hover nearby until I could no longer see them.

We stopped running and incredibly left the fear behind and went back to the place we last saw the light, but it wasn´t there.. we searched the skies and nothing ! but this is the funny part, we turn around again and see this same light again but different now! there was the same green light in the center and like other six or seven small lights around the main one, describing a disk shape object this time it stood still in the air, levitating at 10 meters from the ground and another 30 from us.

I was so astonished, I could not even tell my friend who had driven us to where we had parked across the street from my moms home what I had seen.  My friend was looking forward and did not see what I had seen.  When I called out to my friend his name, he looked over at me and acknowledged. I was trying to get him to look up, but it was too late. I caught out of the corner of my eyes the last bit of the saucer descending over the tree tops in the yard of my moms next door neighbors house. I finally regained my composure enough to tell my friend what I had seen.  I told him that he would not believe me.   He replied to me the following:  ""You are not going to believe what I just saw.  Then he explained that he saw what appeared to have been a flying saucer that headed straight towards us.  It hovered in front of the car, and was also dead silent. It then made an astonishing maneuver and went straight up at an incredible rate of speed.  I told my friend that what we had just witnessed had to be the two points of light that resembled stars, that had followed up all the way from League City.  He told me that we should make a report of what we had witnessed. I told him th! at no one would believe us. I told him that they might want to! have ou r heads examined, and that we did not have any actual proof to confirm what we had seen.  I was not going to go exploring the neighbors back yard in fear of what the apparent Dennison from another world might decide to do to us. The man on the radio said that if you think about extra terrestrial, that they might come to visit you since they know you are curious about them, just as they may be about us. The man said they have an exceptional since of understanding and would know that we mean them no harm, and if we want to see them they would make their presence known to us. My friend and I discussed what the man was talking about all the way from his girl friends house. My friend said that he did not mean them any harm, and that he would like to see them, I told him likewise. So I believe that we got what we wanted to see. My friend and I are night people, and we do not drink alcoholic beverages, or use drugs of any kind.  I was in the military, and I have seen just about eve! rything that the Air Force has that fly's.  What we saw that night resembled nothing I had ever seen before.  The craft I saw had no running lights and just looked like two saucers highly silver luster ed against a clear night background sky.  It shined no light upon anything other than it's self.  I have never seen anything like it before or since. Everything I have mentioned in this report is true and as accurate as I can remember what we had experienced. I do not care about what anyone would think of me anymore. I know for a fact what I had seen, and I know that it was real. I am presenting this to you because I want to make this truth known to the proper authorities. The craft I saw exhibited non of the characteristics listed in the description of features listed below. It was just as I have described it in my explanation here. I remember all the details clearly just as vividly as when it had happened back in 2006. I regret that we did not have a camera to take any phot! os.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,29.405085849056604,-94.9436075471698

I was asleep in my room then awoke and felt like I immediately needed to get up and do something so I got up to go smoke a cigarette in my garage because it had been cold outside for the past two weeks but as I got closer to the garage door I heard a voice in my head say ""YOU NEED TO GO OUTSIDE"" So, I said speaking a pond what I had just heard""YOUR RIGHT LET ME GO OUTSIDE"" so I turned around and went out my back door and as I stepped out the door I noticed that the sky was crystal clear it appeared as if every star in the sky was visible. As I looked to the left I saw what appeared to be something like a rainbow it was purple and pink and it sat right above a tall tree in my neighbor's back yard. It looked like a snakes body when it slithers but not going from West to East but from South to Nor! th above the tall tree and it also appeared as if it was transparent so I said to my self thinking what is that I've never seen that before. Then I looked off to the right of me still scanning the sky hoping I would see a UFO but I didn't so I turned back to look at the strange colors thinking I'm going to watch whatever this is to see if it disappears or fades away and as soon as my eyes locked on the strange colors a circular ball of light surrounded by a neon green and blue gas or plasma substance which stayed around the helicopter sized craft the entire time shot out at super sonic speed and made a complete stop the craft hovered for app 10 seconds and then started to move really really slow to the right of me for about 7 to 10 seconds before shooting off in super sonic speeds without making a sound and left behind 6 circles that look like smoke rings with lines in between each of them. As I turned my head the object appeared to be coming back in the opposite direction ! except this time it appeared to be far out with the stars and ! traveled out as far as I could see within 5 seconds so by this time i was crying like a baby because I couldn't believe what had just happen to me so I stepped up on my stairs to the house and looked up to the sky and asked ""GOD IF THAT WAS MEANT FOR ME AND IF YOU MEANT FOR ME TO SEE THAT WOULD YOU PLEASE SHOW ME ANOTHER SIGN? And as soon as I said that a smaller circular ball of light flew right over my house lower than the UFO with noun of the same characteristic as the UFO except for how bright and illuminated they both were.  couldn't handle it any more so while still crying and in complete shock I went in my room and laid down and felt such a sense of peace that I had a smile on my face from ear to ear and it felt like I was dying and leaving my body then I blacked out within a minutes or less saying oh my GOD oh my GOD. Then I woke up around 10:30am the next morning looking around thinking OK I'm in my room and I jumped up thinking to my self oh my GOD that really did happen to me last night so while in the shower I felt a bump underneath my right arm pit and quickly got out the shower to look at whatever it was knowing that it hadn't been there the morning before or months before or years prior to the event that took place last night. The bump appeared to have a oval black burn mark in the center. The bump went down after two years but now you can clearly see a whole and what appears to be an object perfectly placed in the center where the black mark once was. It is still underneath my arm as ! of this day and it is going on 6 years now. It appeared as if I was burnt by a laser or injected with a hot needle at first but now it appears as if I was implanted with something that Dr Roger Leir studies but it has never caused me any discomfort. All I want is some help so I can understand what happen to me that night. This is my honest to GOD truth. I also have a picture of the mark that's underneath my arm and two picture's I took of a UFO on my birthday March 27 of 2009",2012-10-30T00:00:00,36.51515837104073,-87.36103416289593

In binoculars, I saw a shadow on it, it reminded a crescent moon, so I suppose it was some sort of sphere.   It was not blinking or making any sound and it was flying very fast. I thought, it was a satelite, but it flew little faster.  It was making strange zig-zag movements for circa 20 seconds.  Then it came back where I first saw it.  But I also noticed exactly the same object that stood still until the first one came to it and then they flew together and soon I lost them, they were flying North, but soon there was only one object remaining (I lost sight for couple of seconds, because they were flying above my roof, so I had run to other side of appartment).

For a split second I though our neighbors were outside and heir car lights were on, but he glow was much too bright to have been car lights.  Both my husband and I were unaccountably terrified.  All my hair was standing on end. I was too scared to turn and look out the window, I just felt like something was out there and looking at it would be horrible. we kept hearing a strange sound repeat itself over and over.  It was a high pitched ""ping...ping.""   It would echo and fade and then repeat.   We finally looked out the window and saw a huge blue orb hovering stationary above the tree line.  He feeling this experience gave us was so extreme.  I really can't explain it in a way that makes sense.  We knew that the orb was something ""other.""  We strongly felt that we were being observed, scru! tinized.  Our skin was tingling all over, vibrating kind of.   We turned away from the window and tried to ignore, but we couldn't shut our eyes because idea of closing our eyes with that strange light in the room and the orb so close outside was just terrifying eventually the noise stopped and the light faded away.  We turned to look and the orb was gone.   It was totally silent outside.  Our cat would not come in the room and didn't stop staring at the window for a while.  We have never found out what that orb was but we have spoken to several others who saw it that same night, but at different locations.  His orb was not far out in the atmosphere; it was literally right outside our window, just above the trees.  It was approximately 40 times the size of a basketball.  About a year after that we were walking through a park late in the evening, I don't remember exactly what time, between 7 and 9.   We saw the orb again but only for a second, then it vanished and there was a loud ""boom,"" like thunder but it couldn't have been because it w! as snowi ng.  The power went out immediately after.

What I saw in 77 changed my attitude for life . I have watched the sky diligently ever since . What I saw today was even more than I witnessed back then. Whenever the wife and I are out, if I witness anything in the sky that is not immediately identifiable I say,  There's a ufo.""   It's just good clean fun and wishful thinking, until this afternoon at 4:45pm . We are driving east on McKenzie avenue , a very busy street in Victoria bc Canada.  Total clear sky . I spot an object directly in front of us fluttering in the sky , I say the usual comment . It gets closer and we keep trying to figure out what it is . My first thought is a hi tec kite , she says ""aluminum weather balloon. It keeps getting closer , it is rather large , I would say it is within one mile and approx 1000 feet high . It is a perfectly round disc . metallic , darker on one side with a red dome on the shiny titanium looking side . It fluttered and danced in all directions . It even turned totally sideways and looked as thin as a pancake with a red dome . I told her at this point ""you are witnessing a flying saucer "" She does not argue . We watch it for approx 3-4 minutes . Yes , I was in shock myself even though I have always believed . All the time I am driving in four lane traffic . I almost rear ended a guy. We were stopped at a red light , the guy next to me was not even looking at it . I wanted to say hey buddy can you tell me what I am looking at up there , I said nothing and just kept watching it . It was the classic saucer , seamless , it floated effortlessly and did all kinds of zig zags . We phoned radio and TV and no reports . I did notice some people on bikes pointing and watching . However , we are talking a very very busy road , four lanes of traffic , in a very busy part of the city. classic Eventually it turns north away from us , I actually thought of trying to follow it but I could see it was moving fairly steady , I did not try to chase after it . I already knew what I saw and it was as clear as my hand in front of my face. No one will convince me that military has such an object . This was the same type of description I have heard of since the 50's. If an army had these we would probably be in a one world government situation. It is a good thing the wife and I saw it together because It is unbelievable unless you see it , even if you are a believer as I have always been.

I got up and took a close look from the window surface to see that it was metallic, shiny, like stainless steel, or polished silver. It was rectangular in shape and was moving in a westward direction over the city of Morristown, Tennessee. The unknown flying object was moving slowly towards the nearby city and I ran down stairs to the backyard deck where there is a more wide open view of the sky. As I was rushing to the deck area, I informed my Mother who was cooking lunch to come outside to see this UFO going across the sky. She followed me outside on the open deck and we both saw the object moving slowly across the light blue sky. It did not have any contrail smoke exhaust whatsoever. It did not have any airplane wings, tail rudder, etc. It did not make any engineer noise whatsoever. I watched it! fly across the city of Morristown, at an altitude that made its size about 2” in length with your outstretched arm. I watched it until it disappeared into the distant blue sky. I have no idea what it was and have reported it as a UFO.  To date, this is the 5th UFO I have seen in my lifetime. The others were all different types of “flying objects” such as, the 4th UFO was a similar to the 5th, as rectangular flying object, only its appearance was more like stacked layers of stainless steel that shined intensively in the clear blue sky in July 2012. The 3rd was a circular orb seen at the same location as the 4th UFO, but this object was seen a few years ago and its appearance was similar to a balloon, but somehow seemed more rigid than a balloon, as it was moving horizontally with no wind blowing on that day. I was in Bean Station, TN on the 3rd and 4th Sightings, but both were moving in the same direction of Morristown, TN. The 2nd UFO was seen also in Morristown at my Brothers property, a few years ago, and it had the classical shape of the silvery cigar-shaped, rectangular objects with a strobbing/flashing light at the center. It was moving in southward direction toward White Pine/New Port, TN. This sight! ing was the most bizarre one of all, as I was tilling my brothers garden with a machine and had the sudden, strange desire to look up and when I stopped the machine and looked up, I saw this cigar-shaped craft about 4” in length with the an outstretched arm. It was very silvery metallic and the strobbing lights were intense. I watched it, until it seemed to go into a hole in the sky and disappear from view. I have never had such a strange feeling come over me, as I did that particular day. Finally, the 1st UFO was seen at my Mothers former house in Harrogate, TN and I saw it in the skies above her backyard moving through the clouds. It was brass color in appearance and very shiny, as it went in and out of the clouds. This UFO was the most impressive of all 5 that I have seen in my lifetime.  Also, a few days after my 50th Birthday on August 15th, 2012, I saw something strange in the sky, the likes of which I have never seen before, in all my 50 years on this earth. The regular light blue sky and cotton-like clouds were divided in half and covered over by a another darker blue sky layer, like a sheet of plastic that you could see through it and watch the clouds moving across the sky, from behind it. This strange phenomenon appeared to split the sky in half on a diagonal straight edge, with the light blue regular sky & clouds on the left and the aqua Blue sky on the right. I watched the (2) skies for about 2 or 3 minutes and the strange aqua blue half did not move at all, while the clouds kept moving out from behind it. Then I thought about getting someone else to come see it or to get a camera, but as I turned around to put up some garden tools back into the basement, and then turned back around to look at the divided two skies, the aqua Blue portion had almost v! irtually disappeared in less than a few minutes. All that was left to even know it had ever been there at all, was a very faint outline of the diagonal edge where both skies were split up, or divided apart. I watched a few more seconds, maybe a half minute, or so, and it had completely disappeared that quickly! I’ve never seen anything like that before or since! Some friends of mine in Greeneville, TN, told me they saw some strange colors in the sky at about that same time. I am still researching the data to see if other people in east tennessee have seen this remarkable, rare, phenomenon...",2012-09-24T00:00:00,36.21558430232558,-83.31623779069768

Then it began to curve downward and it was still going pretty fast, then it started to slow down and as it was still going down it started to change shape to look like a star. I thought this object was going to take the place of a star because of the slow pace it was going, but it was still moving and started going down in a slight zig zag motion.  Then it changed direction again and started to go off into the distance.  And I know it wasn't a plane because what plane needs its lights on while the sun is still up? It would appear black or gray, not a glowing white orb that was at an altitude that seemed too high for a plane.

I must say I have heard and viewed of UFO footages during Rock Festivals and large gatherings worldwide. Here’s my observations:   After watching the Tragically Hip Concert at Burl’s Creek Family Campground, we returned to camp to stay for the overnight camp. At about 11:45 pm  Sunday ,July 1st that late evening I witnessed three round brilliant orange UFOs. Two were much more distant- southward moving very slow - then a third one came across much closer above moving from the west to east. Passing the moon as a reference in the video clip taken  There is clear night night footage of it's orange glow   Within 5 seconds I immediately  pulled out my camera  to capture the moment on video mode.The characteristics were very strange in pulsation of brightness coming from this brilliant orange round object. Inside the UFO is best described  like it ‘ swirling ‘ motion inside the object. It  also moved fluid ~~ like - different. Really a extraordinary show in the sky for near five minutes. Please  note: That in fact. THIS THING had size to confirm not Chinese lanterns. No way indeed!  The actual size appeared 30 - 60 feet in diameter or LARGER  Moved like a ' wheel ' vertical. There must have been hundreds of witnesses that night at camp   You had to be there to see it FOR YOURSELF! It was so beautiful and very bizarre in nature.  What is perplexing about this incredible sighting witnessed is that  ‘ feeling ‘ I felt before the sighting event.  That something would appear either during the concert event or there after.  I suppose my prediction was indeed correct. This event has created great excitement for me and I beleived that there would be hundreds of other witnesses that night at camp.  The next morning I spoke with a Parks Ground keeper, he also witnessed the three.  First he thought they were helicopters, then he confirmed his belief that they were UFOs. He said it was the strangest thing he had seen in his life. As there was also reports coming out also from Barrie, Ontario July 1,2012. Added to other locations in Ontario that evening PS I also believe that fireworks and Chinese Lanterns attract curious unknown seekers from the sky. Enjoy the photographic evidence!  *Still shot also attached Enjoy Summer 2012",2012-08-05T00:00:00,44.4001,-79.6663

At this time the man that lived in the farm house came up the same road from the east [opposite direction] riding his bicycle and i said to him hey  have you ever seen a UFO and he said no. Then i said well there are two right there and they just flew over your house.  I could tell he was amazed immediately as we were to what we were witnessing.  About 45 seconds later a third craft appeared,following the exact same path as the first two. About 45 seconds later a fourth craft appeared also following the same paths as the first three. All four crafts were identical, about the size of an automobile, 100 feet in altitude. The crafts were flying very slow, about 30 miles an hour. There was absolutely no sound. They were shaped like you took 4 or 5 round spheres 5 feet in diameter and fastened them together. The shape as a whole was oval i would say.  Each sphere was equally lite with a beautiful orange light that was pulsating to a darker orange almost red.The crafts were pulsating like a heart beat. The sky was clear not a cloud,95 degrees,no wind dead still. We watched the crafts disappear straight to the north,never changing direction. The total time of the sighting was about 7 minutes.

(July 3, 2012 in Irvine, CA)  My husband and I were walking the dogs around 10:30pm, when I looked up at the stars, and noticed a triangular object high in the sky. It was gliding slowly, in a straight line, making no sound – flying in from the coast.  The bottom of the object had three large deep orange lights, spaced close together and non-blinking.  In the center of these lights was a wide beam of bright blue-white light (shaped like an inverted ice-cream cone), pointing toward ground.  After the radiant object turned off the cone-shaped beam, it continued to fly in the same straight line.  Then it stopped and hovered overhead a few seconds before ascending vertically into space.  My husband is a private pilot and estimates the object flew near 10,000 ft.  He is confident it was not a helicopter with a searchlight.

I am a US Navy veteran, and was with a friend of mine, who is a US Army veteran, on the evening of 23AUG2012 at approx. 2030Hrs, when we both noticed a unique light array approaching us from the north.  We were both sitting on the open plaza at Boston City Hall Plaza this night.  This light array resembled nothing we had ever seen before, as we are closely familiar with military, commercial, and private aircraft, as well as blimps, dirigibles, hot air balloons, and ultralight craft. As this light array got closer, we noticed that there were NO red & green (port & starboard) lights, NO wing lights, nor were there any type of landing (approach) lights seen anywhere on this craft.  Also very noticeable was the fact that there was absolutely NO sound whatsoever associated with this craft. Less than 5-10 minutes before we noticed this light array, there was an airplane on its approach to Boston's Logan Airport, and this light array did NOT resemble any other known craft. I estimate the approximate speed of this craft to be between 25-35MPH, which gave me sufficient time to get a detailed look at it, and later to sketch out the details that I saw. Sketch to follow in a separate mailing, as I have no current access to a scanner to electronically email it out to NUFORC. As this light array passed directly overhead, we both noticed that it was definitely triangular in shape, the outer body being a very black color, with an inner structure a light black or dark gray color. There were 3 white lights on each corner (rimmed in a gold/yellowish color), with a very large bright white light in the direct center of this craft, also rimmed in the same gold/yellowish color, and at the stern of this craft were 2 red lights, near the rear points of this triangle shape, equidistant apart from one another. This craft did NOT cast any shadow or reflected light to the ground, had NO sound even as it passed overhead, and continued directly south until it disappeared behind some tall buildings. Less than 5 minutes later, a twin-engine airplane passed overhead, going from east to west, and this craft we witnessed was nothing like the plane we saw moments later. Being military veterans, we both discussed what exactly we witnessed that evening, ruling out all known aircraft very familiar to us, and have no answers to this unique UAP/UFO sighting. But we know exactly what we DID see that night, and this triangular craft is something not of our current military, as we do not have this type of current technology at this time.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,42.3416629506008,-71.06563371161549

Lights observed on ground  with smaller red light observed leaving and returning to larger lights.,Peach Springs,AZ,2012-05-11T22:00:00,unknown,4 days,"Occurred : 5/11/2012 22:00  (Entered as : 05/11/2012 22:00) Reported: 10/4/2012 1:55:43 AM 01:55 Posted: 10/30/2012 Location: Peach Springs, AZ Shape: Unknown Duration:4 days",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93298.html,"Lights observed on ground  with smaller red light observed leaving and returning to larger lights. On 05/11/12 at about 2100 hours, myself (Sgt.) and two other officers were dispatched to an area east of Peach Springs, AZ. (Route 66 / Mile Post 110) in reference to a report of a green laser cockpit strike on a commercial aircraft at 22,000 feet.  We responded to the area and were unable to locate a source of a green laser.  Since we were we had not located anyone in the reported area, we then began to spread out and check the surrounding area of anything out of the ordinary.  One of the officers reported to me that he was seeing strange lights near the Grand Canyon.  Myself and another officer responded to an area on Route 66 / Mile Post 105.  At first glance, I observed lights out in the distance and was puzzled because lights should not have been located in the area they were being seen due to the remote and rough terrain.  I had recieved reports earlier in the week of a search and rescue effort that was being conducted by the Coconino County Sheriff's ! Office and I made contact with Search & Rescue personnel and was informed that there was no search going on at that time and that what I was seeing was not anything they were doing.  I contacted the local Fire / EMS department and a paramedic and EMT/ Fire Marshall arrived at the scene.  They advised that they had no idea what it was and we came to the conclusion that what we were seeing was a landed UFO.  The Fire Chief arrived shortly afterward.  He has always lived in this area and knows the country very well.  He had no idea what the lights could be or how they could be where they were at.  We all stood at the roadside looking off to the Northwest at the lights. While looking at the lights, I observed the following: I observed that the lights at first numbered 5 and then at times 6 (the 6th light would sometimes stay lit as bright as the other 5 lights for long periods of time and then sometimes dim and then fade and go out).  They were large diameter round lights bluis! h white in color.  They seemed to have an aura around them and! seemed to light up the area where they were located.  I observed that the lights were arranged in a row and were evenly spaced.  While watching the lights I observed that a smaller red light would light up and then move away from the larger lights.  It would move around the area, and then return to the larger lights.  I watched most of this using 8 power Steiner binoculars.  The other officers also used their binoculars to watch the lights.  The group of us stayed there on the roadside for approximately an hour and then the fire and EMS personnel left and returned to quarters.  The other two officers left the scene and I stayed behind and continued to observe the lights.  I continued to watch as the lights continued to do as previously described.  I attempted to estimate the distance at which the lights were located but could not tell with any certainty.  If I had to make a rough estimate, I would say 10+ miles away and the lights had to be in an area of at least 100 yards.  The co! nditions at the time of sighting was: Clear, cool, dark /no moon, all quiet, air traffic and stars could be easily seen overhead and the glow of Las Vegas, NV could be seen in the distance.  I met again with the other two officers and we discussed an attempt to go and locate the lights.  One of the officers suggested that I contact the Arizona DPS helicopter and have them fly to the sight.  Due to the unknown circumstances and having no evidence that it was anyone in trouble or a crash site, I was reluctant to contact them and potentially put an air crew in possible danger.  We left the road side viewing area and proceeded to a nearby hill in an attempt to get a better view.  We were able to still see the lights, but not any better than where we first saw them.  We continued for the next few hours to locate a way to get to the lights, but were unable to do so.  I watched the lights again from the roadway and then left at the end of my shift on 05/12/12 @ 0200 hours.  I advi! sed the other officers to keep an eye on the lights and let me! know of any changes.  The other officers advised that the lights stayed where we saw them though out the hours of darkness.  On 05/12/12 at dusk, I again checked the area of the original sighting, and I could again see the lights.  I reported the sighting to another officer who had not been on the night before and advised them of what we had saw.  He came to the spot and observed the lights with me.  He advised that he wished to go and attempt to locate the lights and he and a officer from the night before attempted to locate the lights.  They were unable to locate the lights.  On 05/13/12 I brought a 30x spotting scope with me to work and again observed the lights off in the distance in what appeared to be the same location.  I could see the lights clearer and again observed 6 lights with a smaller red light leaving and returning to the larger lights.  The next day an investigator and a officer who had witnessed the lights on the first night attempted to locate the area again but ! were unable to get to the location.  As far as it is known, there is no way to travel to the location by vehicle.  When I returned to shift on 05/15/12, I found that the lights were no longer visible.  I spoke with the other officers who knew about the lights and they advised that the lights had been there on the 14th and in the same spot.  I have kept an eye on the area since the sighting and have not seen the lights since.  No explanation of the what the lights were or why they were there have ever been found.  Also no photographs were taken of the lights.  We did attempt to take photos, but due to the distance involved, they did not turn out.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,35.5292,-113.4255

At approximately 1:30am, on May 20th 2012, I happened to look out the window at the sky behind my home.  What I saw is something I will NEVER forget or be able to explain. There, in the clouds, was a bluish light going around in a large slightly irregular circular pattern.  The “light” was rather large and in the clouds not a ground light shining up.  The night was completely overcast, but the clouds where it was were very slowly spiraling also.  Much, much slower than the light itself. It was covering a large area, I would estimate from the ground about a mile and a half radius. There was no noise whatsoever. I got my wife to come and see and we went outside to watch it. We watched for about 45 minutes. She began to get a little “freaked out” so we went in. I continued to keep checking on it for a little bit. It was gone after about 20-30 minutes.  I did not see it stop or exit. We had not been asleep prior to this and I am a smoker who smokes outside in the bac! kyard. This was not a spotlight, as it had not been there 20 minutes prior to my first sighting of it.  I say this because I had gone out to smoke about that length of time prior.  I have looked for it to return EVERY night since. We cannot explain this and have really tried, as I don’t consider myself a “believer.” But this was definitely unidentified and it was flying. As for the object, I think “it” was obscured in the clouds. If this can be explained or have seen similar I would like to know for our piece of mind.

I am not sure off hand of the exact date but I know it was at the end of the month and on a Saturday early evening when it is still very light outside with daylight being summertime.  My husband who is an aviation engineer and I were both in front of our home.  My husband was near the side of the house shearing the shrubbery and I was sitting on the garden bench we have out front near the lawn with my dog.  I looked to my left past our neighbors house and I see two silver objects in the sky.  Both were the same shape, flattish, long and disk shaped.

I point to them and he then sits at the curb in fro! nt of our home and tells me to get the binoculars.  I hurried inside and came right out with them.  He looks through the binoculars at them and by this time they have moved more to the right, one is higher than the other, and they are at a diagonal position one from the other.  He gives the binoculars to me and helps me to know just where I should hold them to see the objects.  What I saw was amazing as they looked to be spinning incredibly fast yet not moving.  Hard to explain, you would have to see them.  Also there seemed to be a red tinge at the bottom of both objects.  After looking what I felt to be long enough, I then give the binoculars back to my husband.  After looking for about another minute, he informs me that they both just disappeared.  He is skeptic.  I am not.  His explanation is that they are unlike anything that he has ever seen before.

We were at New Germany State park near Grantsville MD.  It was a very clear night and this area has almost no light pollution at night. Its on the middle of nowhere.  We were standing on the rock dam at the end of the lake.  We were looking up at how good the stars were showing up when i noticed something very bright and changing colors.  It also was pretty much hovering at what i guess was maybe two thousand feet.  There is mountains in the area but it was well above those . We watched it for a good 25 minutes.  The entire time it never got any closer our further  away. Visually it appeared many miles away.  The odd thing was it did spirals then hover then zip to the right then stop.  From the distance away we were i think the speed of its movements to be of a very strange nature. I've been around all sorts of planes all my life a my dad was air force.  I've seen all sorts of planes pull crazy maneuvers.  This thing would just zip in a straight line and stop instantly.  finally i was positive i had just seen my first UFO. Trying to rule out things i would line up the lights which morphed from bright white to blue and red to trees.  This confirmed it really was moving like i thought it was.  During the time we were watching it we saw several planes fly over with lights flashing and it was  obvious those were planes.

Brief:  While taking a cigarette break at my place of work, outside the building (side facing the parking lot, opposite from James Street), I spotted two different distinct airborne craft less than a minute apart, which exhibited shape and flight characteristics not consistent with any known manmade aircraft or bird. (having had an unequivocal daylight UFO sighting in my youth, I will often specifically watch the skies, and spot birds and aircraft while I’m outside on smoke breaks during my workday.  In 13 years working in this location, this is the first time I’ve seen something here in daylight that I could not identify, and thus qualifies as a legitimate UFO sighting)   Sighting detail:  I was looking up at the sky to the Northeast with the sun at my back, and spotted a black object of indeterminate size at a high altitude, at approximately 55 degrees above the horizon.  At that distance, it was difficult to make out any detail, though it appeared to be elongated.  By comparison, it appeared to be the approximate scale of a hyphen on a printed page held at arms length, ever so slightly thicker in the middle.  No lights of any kind were observable on the craft, and it did not change shape as would a bird flapping it’s wings. I noticed it because it was moving erratically, zig-zagging back and forth, and up and down.   It would dart to the left, stop in mid air, wiggle up and down, dart back the other way, stop, and wiggle up and down.   It did not move in perfectly straight lines, and its movement was jerky and appeared uncoordinated. As I observed the erratic flight, I first said to myself, “wow, I’m actually seeing this!”   Judging it’s travel distance back and forth when it was darting is difficult without knowing it’s approximate size or distance, but if it were the size of a sparrow, it would have been darting back and forth, from my left to right and back, covering a distance of at least 100 feet per second when it moved, with no noticeable acceleration or deceleration.  It would be moving, then stationary, then moving again at high speed.  I observed it darting erratically as described for approximately 25 seconds.  Then it began to move smoothly at a high rate of speed toward the southeast, and became too distant to observe after approximately 15 seconds.  I continued to observe the area of sky where it disappeared for a further minute or so, and saw it come back into view again momentarily, before vanishing again. At this point, I returned to looking at the patch of sky where it had first appeared, and within about 30 seconds, there appeared a bright white cigar or disc shaped object, following the trajectory of the first object.  This object may have been larger or closer to me, as it was much easier for me to see that it was an elongated shape.  It had a much clearer “cigar” or disc shape, bulging in the middle, and tapered/rounded at the edges.  It was moving at a constant high rate of speed toward the southwest, and left no contrail.  It moved across the sky considerably faster than the jetliners frequently visible form this location, following exactly the flight path of the first object, and also receded too far to be visible after approximately 25 seconds. Just before it disappeared from view to the Southwest (over Downtown Syracuse), a co-worker came out of the building and asked what I was looking at, and I pointed it out, but at that point it was too faint for him to observe. When I first sighted the second object, I could see that it did not have wings or a tail, and approximately every five seconds, what appeared to be a large bright white light on the top center of the “cigar shape” would appear, fade up to very bright, (brighter than the object itself) then fade out again over the course of about three seconds.  It did not blink, it faded in and out.  This repeated at regular intervals until it was out of sight in the southwest sky.  The object did not change course, and moved at a uniform very high rate of speed, faster than any plane. At the moment the second object faded from view, a twin engine jetliner (appeared to be a Boeng Triple-7) was passing in an easterly path through the middle of the area where I’d observed the other objects, at approximately 8,000 feet.  It’s wings, engines, horizontal stabilizer, and twin contrail were clearly discernable.  It appeared approximately 3 times larger at that distance than the other two objects I had observed.  I do not believe that either object was closer to me than the jetliner. At that altitude, the jetliner was traversing the sky at approximately one forth the rate of the two objects I had just observed, meaning that if they had been at a similar altitude and distance, their speed of travel would have been, at minimum  four times the minimum stall speed of such an aircraft, or approximately 800 Knots / 920 miles per hour / 1480 kilometers per hour. Neither object made any sound that I noticed, nor was the jetliner loud enough for me to hear it above the noise of the city from that altitude. (I do not carry a phone with a camera, and was unable to obtain images of the sighting.  However, I'm am going to take photographs of the location, and draw on the photos to clearly indicate what I witnessed.  I will also include an aerial photo map indicating observer position, and approximate flightpath of objects observed.  I will forward those as soon as available.)   (further notes)   Witness background:  I’m am a white male, 45 years old, professional.  My vision is better than 20/20, based on my eye test for my driver’s license renewal earlier this year.  I have never needed glasses or contacts. In my 20’s, I was in the National Guard, assigned to a helicopter maintenance battalion, and I am well familiar with the flight characteristics and capabilities of both military and civilian aircraft, having observed countless planes / helicopters in flight.  I have spent a considerable amount of time around military and civilian airfields, and aboard both rotor-wing and fixed-wing aircraft.  I can tell the difference between a Sikorsky and a Bell helicopter in flight at a distance of several miles. My older brother was a private pilot, and owned two single-engine fixed-wing aircraft, with which he gave me informal flight instruction, and I have flown both of those aircraft numerous times, also having performed unassisted takeoffs, and landings under the supervision of a licensed pilot.  I have also been a passenger on numerous commercial aircraft.  Given my experience with aviation, I consider myself to be a better observer of aircraft than the average layperson, and also reasonably accurate at determining the size, altitude, and distance of objects I observe in the sky. Witness sobriety:  Prior to this sighting, I had not had any alcohol for over 36 hours, and I do not indulge in any other intoxicants.   This morning I had a cup of coffee and a couple of cigarettes.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,43.05037092436975,-76.157063697479

I watched with 3 other people as it hovered nearby.  It appeared to be a couple hundred feet away in the horizontal direction, and appeared to have an altitude of only a couple hundred feet.  Assuming these distances were accurate, the visible light was probably around 1 to 4 feet wide.  It's possible that the object was much higher and larger, but that was not my original impression. The object appeared to be simple a ball of light.  It flickered slightly, much like a fire would.  Its color was almost white, perhaps slightly yellowed, much like the color of a fluorescent light bulb.  It sometimes appeared as though there was the dark outline of an object only slightly larger than the ""orb"" of light, but this could have been a trick of the eye.  It appeared to hover motionless, but after 10 minutes or so, it drifted across the sky until it was over a mile away.  I'm not sure whether or not the object was at first still and then started moving, or was moving the whole time.  Its movement was entirely linear and extremely slow. I am an electrical engineering student and am therefore someone familiar with science, aircraft, and the like.  I am positive that this is unlike any object I had ever seen;  it was clearly not an airplane or a helicopter or similar.  It is possible, however, that it was some sort of extremely reflective weather balloon or something similar, reflecting light off of the moon, which was directly behind us as we viewed the object.

It was traveling due north, and much nearer the earth than ever before. Evidently some of the machinery was out of order, for it was making a speed of only ten or twelve miles an hour and gradually settling toward the earth.  It sailed over the public square, and when it reached the north part of town collided with the tower of Judge Proctor's windmill and went into pieces with a terrific explosion, scattering debris over several acres of ground, wrecking the windmill and water tank and destroying the judge's flower garden. The pilot of the ship is supposed to have been the only one aboard, and while his remains are badly disfigured, enough of the original has been picked up to show that he was not an inhabitant of this world. Mr. T. J. Weems, the United States Signal Service officer at this place and an authority on astronomy, gives it as his opinion that he was a native of the planet Mars. Papers found on his person -- evidently the record of his travels -- are written in some unknown hieroglyphics, and can not be deciphered. The ship was too badly wrecked to form any conclusion as to its construction or motive power.  It was built of an unknown metal, resembling somewhat a mixture of aluminum and silver, and it must have weighed several tons. The town is today full of people today who are viewing the wreck and gathering specimens of strange metal from the debris.  The pilot's funeral will take place at noon tomorrow.

I am putting all of the events together in somewhat chronological order. I feel this event occurred when I was about 5 or 6 years old while our family was driving from our home in suburban Chicago, Illinois.  My mom's parents owned a resort on a lake in northern Wisconsin. We used to leave our house in the early hours of the morning on these family trips in the Summer. Under hypnosis I recalled the events basically beginning like this.  Seeing a huge ball of light in front of us. As if the moon had come down out of the sky.  The light was all contained within the big globe of light. It did not refract like a flashlight or other kind of light. I also recall seeing curved kind of diamond shaped different colored lights reflected either on the windshield or on the dashboard. Our car was stopped on the side of the road.  Behind our car dow! n the road there was a blue light. There were three tall figures silhouetted coming from that light toward our car. I was very upset at this point in the hypnotherapy.  Then there was a figure at the driver's window. It looked like someone with an orange monkey face.  He reached in through the open window and did something with the ignition or steering wheel. I was not upset at all about this but very calm. I recall seeing my dad either staring straight ahead in a daze or slumped over the wheel.  Then several of us (Mom from the passenger seat directly in front of me; brother a year younger; sister two years younger than me; and myself) were taken from the vehicle and led by very tall beings whom I cannot completely recall. Our baby sister was in her carseat in the back and we left her behind. She was crying. One of the beings picked up my sister 2 years younger than me. She touched it's face. I could not recall what the face looked like. A being took my hand in its hand and l! ed me out of the car. The closest I can describe the feeling o! f its ha nd is like those rubber toys that have the wires inside and how they feel when you bend them. Its fingers felt like that. Then we were inside the craft. It was sectioned like orange sections inside in crescent shapes. The floor had kind of ribbed raised strips and was like foam rubber. It was gradually curving just like an orange section would be. There was a man who was standing on the side of an entrance. He looked like a movie star. His skin color was pink but extreme pink like carnation pink. Not a natural human pink skin color. He was wearing what looked like a snowmobile suit. Then I looked again and in his place was some kind of robot or metal kind of statue with a base and a pole and top like for a head. I then saw my mother laying down. She was rubbing the right side of her head. Then I saw my brother laying down and he was also rubbing the right side of his head. I did not see my sister on board the craft. Then I was laying down. They took something and shoved it u! p my right nostril and I felt a pain like a headache on the right side of my head and I rubbed my head as well. I could not 'see' the beings standing around me very well at first. But since that time I have had more information come to me and they were what I would call ""The Whites"". Their skin is chalk white. They have big eyes like fish eyes and they have large appendages on the sides of their heads like big ears. They wear clothes which are black and shiny like the cloth is of spun shiny metal. Thinking about that cloth gives me a creepy feeling. They pulled down my pants and used a sharp object on me. During that time I thought they only touched the end of my penis with it. But since that time it has come to me that they shoved it up inside the shaft. It was a long needle. That is all I have recalled about being on the ship. I have a vague memory of being back in the car and nobody saying anything for quite some time. And dad also just driving silently for a ways before! we gradually started talking again and being I guess aware of! where w e were.",,42.9252,-89.1562

What we saw were two stationary orange discs side by side. My son has much better vision than I said that on the outside edge of each were small red flames all around. We live in the country next to a lake (if that matters) and there was no noise emitting from either of them. It was hard to explain the distance only to say that the size of each was fairly equal to the size of the moon but it seemed they were no more than 5 miles at the maximum away from us. My son said that he really didn't see them much longer than me but that they were in the same position than when I saw them. When I returned; it was just then that we got to see them leave our area. They moved on very slowly spinning at first in unision with each other then very quickly sped up but it seemed to me they disappeared before actually flying out of sight though they were heading in a southwestern direction when they left.

I went over to the window and saw what looked like a large orange fireball. It was traveling in what looked like a south east direction coming in from Cape Smokey area in Cape Breton but way up in the sky. We went outside to get a better look at it and my 12yr old and his friends were outside watching it as well.  When it got close to being over Glace Bay it changed. This is the weird part, the orange firey glow disappeared and all we could see was a large dark round shape. There was a thin see through cloud layer at a high altitude and the object seemed to change direction and head east out over the ocean. You could clearly see it was above the clouds and we watched it until it disappeared out over the ocean.  My sons friend turned to me and said, ""What the hell was that?""  I told him it was probably just a satelite and to go finish playing basketball. This was no satelite though and I have no clue what it was.  Compared to all the overseas jets that fly over Glace Bay this thing seemed to be about 10 to 15 times the size of a jumbo jet   And we could clearly see it was at a high altitude above the clouds.  Whatever this was, it was big. It started out looking like a ball of fire and then it was like someone turned off a light switch and the firey glow stopped and all you could see was the large round dark shape. I checked online to see if the ISS was flying over cause we've seen it before at night and thought it might have been light play from the evening sun but the online tracking system didn't have the ISS anywhere near Atlantic Canada at that time.

I can’t judge airspeed. It traveled smoothly, meaning it did not deviate up or down, or side to side while we watched it. It appeared to have a small flame like that of a helium balloon underneath, but no visible gondola. The red color seemed to glow from the inside of the object. There was no sound. I think it might have been between 200 and 400 feet up, though I'm not sure because I really don’t know how to judge heights. It didn't appear to be large.  The object appeared to have been ten to fifteen feet in diameter. I called the local airport and was told there was no hot air balloon reported at that time, or any round air vehicle.  It is a small, county airport and does not record aircraft landings and take-offs.

We were viewing fireworks in a parking lot in the center of Durant, OK, on University St. and 19th Avenue.  I was facing southwest along with my family when my husband saw the first orb of the evening.  This was the one that came closest to us. (The weather was warm, sky was clear and there were no clouds in the sky whatsoever. When it got darker, around 9:00-10:30pm, we were able to see many constellations from the center of town). Close to dusk, approximately 8:40pm on July 4, 2012, we saw a bright orange orb-like object smoothly move across the sky from the south to the north.  The object slowly passed over us and with the contrast of the darker and lighter sky with the sunset, I saw what looked like a larger, dark portion on top of the orange circular light.  It traveled overhead for about one minute before completely disappearing and suddenly toward the! north/northwest.  However, as it traveled, the light flickered inconsistently, like a candle. It did not blink as an airplane or water tower light blinks, rhythmically. Unfortunately, we had not yet set up our video camera and tripod to catch this object.  We had seen similar objects the past three years on the 4th of July, so we decided to try and videotape this year.  As a result, we taped almost 30 minutes of footage of various orbs coming and going from 8:45pm-10:20pm.  While the camera is older and the footage is often shaky, the moon, buildings, fireworks, trees, and other structures can be seen.  Our five-year-old daughter also spotted some of the orbs. Most of the orbs seemed to be about the size of an aspirin or somewhat smaller from the distance we were located.  Some seemed further than others, but one thing was very clear – they were NOT fireworks, flares, or airplanes.  There is a small regional airport on the southeast side of town, however, I don’t think most private planes take off as quickly or in groups as these orbs did.  And, all of the orbs were identical in size, color, and flight pattern.  The only difference was the speed, some traveled a little more slowly than others but all headed from south to north/northeast or northwest. Shortly after our first sighting, we began to see one orange orb after another, sometimes two or four at a time, pass from lower in the horizon from south heading north/northwest and completely disappearing after 30 seconds to one minute.  They did not travel like an airplane would but rather seemed to be traveling much faster and in a linear fashion.  When more than one orb appeared at a time, they looked as if they were in a formation or following one another.  They all were light orange in color and flickered. I was primarily facing southeast since most of the orbs seemed to originate from that destination just over the horizon.  Later in the evening, closer to 10pm, the orbs were further to the west of town but still originating from the south.  This also seemed to coincide with the firework activity.  Again, the orbs can be seen on the video, and they clearly are higher and further away than the fireworks. Observer #2 – male, age 15  I saw from about 20 to 30 glowing orange lights most of them flying in the same direction I don’t know how often they came but it was mostly after a bunch of fireworks went off. They started at about 9 and they began to slow down as people stopped to do fireworks they seemed to be about the same size but some looked a lot closer than others; some also seemed to move faster or be brighter. The first object that I saw looked the nearest. The sun was still up but barely, you could see a dark irregularly shaped thing on top. It seemed to have some kind of hook around the light and looked like it was holding the light, the rest of the objects did not have this. The other orbs would be there for about thirty seconds then at some point disappear with no trail behind it. Some looked red but would than turn orange but would become orange. They would also slowly ascend at different rates. There would also be multiple lights at the same time. They didn’t touch each other and I couldn’t tell if there was a shape to connect them.  The first object I saw came from the south of town but the majority came from the southeast. All of them looked to be going north, northeast but all coming from the south. They didn’t blink or dim at all. They were bright orange lights that would last longer than any of the fireworks and move in a small diagonal path ascending but slowly. I couldn’t tell how fast they were moving or the exact distance they were. The most I saw at one time was four and that’s when fireworks were the most active.  They were all silent. No sound could be heard but the highway and fireworks. Observer #3 – male, age 42  Date: July 4, 2012: I was present at the location of the sightings primarily observing my two young children during the experience. I was also lighting some small fireworks for my kids. The first sighting this year was confusing to me because I could see it even though it was still rather light on the western horizon (we arrived early before people started lighting most of their luminescent fireworks). It was an ovular object that was black in contrast to the sky with an orange light on approximately the bottom quarter. It appeared very low on the horizon and I found it bizarre because it was so visible. I had seen the orange colored orbs on the two preceding 4th of July holidays; but, I had never seen the unlit black portion above the orange light. It floated across the sky, from south to north, without making a noise. I asked my wife and 15-year-old stepson what it was. We were all baffled because it was so, well, blatant. I tried to set up the camera in time to capture it! , but was unsuccessful.  I wasn’t set up for recording because it was still early in the evening. Our camera was set on autofocus (because I hadn’t read online recording guidelines prior to our first attempts at recording these objects), so I was unable to capture it on film before it traversed the full length of the horizon out of view. After this, my focus was primarily on my children. We were in an empty parking lot in our rural town; but, I am very careful in keeping an eye on my children, especially with all of the fireworks that were being ignited around us. Durant, Oklahoma, has a city ordinance that allows the lighting of fireworks within city limits only on July 4th of each year. So, people really light a lot of fireworks in our town on this evening. That being said, since I have seen the orange orbs glide across the horizon for three consecutive years now, I was always looking around me to see if there were other orbs intermingled with the fireworks exploding all around us. I saw many. Some were very distant; others were much closer and clearer. My wife took over with the camera, and she and my stepson tried to capture as many of the orbs as possible on the 30 minute minidisc we had in our standard definition camera. I saw approximately 20 of these orbs myself. Most were on the eastern side of Durant city limits traveling south to north/northeast. A few appeared on the western side of town and seemed traveled south to north/northwest. The ones that were closest captured my attention the most. They appeared to be orange with a hint of red in them. The close ones also seemed to have a sort of halo or light haze around them that could not be captured by our outdated video camera. The orbs seemed to be traveling solo, however, there were times when more than one was in view. Also, when viewed in the northern sky after they passed, I could sometimes see three to five at once before they disappeared out of view. A few constants I wish to provide with regard to these sightings: The orbs were all very similar in color and shape and did not waiver on the vertical plane. Closer orbs traveled at a quicker pace than more distant orbs; but, they may have all been traveling at the same speed due to their relative distance. None of the orbs made any noise as they traveled, although the fireworks being discharged in their peripheral were making plenty of noise, which may have concealed noise if I take all possibilities into consideration. The frequency of their appearance seemed to coincide with the number of fireworks that were being discharged into the sky, which I personally interpreted as providing concealment or a form of camouflage for the objects. When we packed up to leave, there were very few fireworks still being discharged. There were also very few orbs in visible in the sky by the time we left correlating with this decrease. I am an educated man.  I have attended 10 years of college and am, quite honestly, a skeptic. I seek data and quantitative evidence before I believe any hypotheses or theories regarding any phenomena (my motto is “show me your data”).  I am not by any stretch of the definition a conspiracy theorist, but rather a diligent and responsible observer of the world around me. I have tried to make sense of these sightings over the past three years using what I have learned in my education concerning astronomy and the other physical sciences. I have clearly ruled out these orbs as being airplanes as these objects did not have the typical light patterns, sounds, or smoke trails of private or passenger airliners. My best personal (and humble) hypothesis as  to their purpose (which goes beyond describing the tangible evidence before me) is that they are mapping the land as cartographers of sorts or perhaps scanning for minerals beneath the earth. But, that goes beyond the purpose of this ! report.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,33.995,-96.3917

Was on a party boat with others out on Lake Union waiting for the fireworks to begin (and no drinking!).  Saw the first (and single) object moving slowly from north to south directly over our head.  At first thought it was a helicopter, but had an orange/red glow and no navigation lights and no sound.  Then thought it might be an airplane at high elevation catching the sun.  It moved south and then disappeared.  Thought it may have gone into the shadow of the earth. Perhaps 10 minutes later saw two similar lights/objects moving from south to north and far to the south.  Very close together it seemed; and too close to each other to be airplanes.  They disappeared as they moved to the north.  Which seems odd if they were entering the earth’s shadow, as the first one disappeared as it was heading south.  There may have been one or two lights/objects off to the east at this time. Then during the height of the Lake Union fireworks show about 15 minutes later there were numerous lights/objects (five?) far off to the east moving north to south, with two of the objects close together.  They disappeared as they moved slowly to the south, but did not disappear at the same time, and also did not disappear at the same latitude (so perhaps not due to the earth’s shadow).  All of the sightings lasted for perhaps 1 to 2 minutes before they would disappear.  Other than the two possible pairs of objects, they were not in any formation. I live outside of the city of Seattle but am tempted to head back tomorrow night, and it should be similar weather conditions, to see if this occurs again which may indicate that it is a normal occurrence of airplane reflections.

Ring of blue lights approx 200 in diameter slowly flying cross night sky at 500 feet in 1966,Huntington Beach,CA,,circle,10 seconds,"Occurred : 11/15/1966 19:40  (Entered as : 11/xx/1966 19:40) Reported: 4/24/2012 3:20:53 PM 15:20 Posted: 5/13/2012 Location: Huntington Beach, CA Shape: Circle Duration:10 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88636.html,"Ring of blue lights approx 200 in diameter slowly flying cross night sky at 500 feet in 1966 Some background on me in 1966:  This happened in 1966 when I was 10 years old.  My father was a professional pilot and owns his own small plane so I grew up around aircraft and airports.  Also, nearby our home was a spot called Mile Square where the Marine pilots practiced in Helicopters prior to deployment to Vietnam so I can say I saw all kinds of Hellos daily.  Living in Southern California, Fountain Valley, if you didn’t see the Good Year Blimp at least once a week  It was only because you never look up.  I am now 55 and retired from a fulfilling career in aviation and have seen a lot of things but nothing like what I saw when I was 10 and I would like to share this long kept sighting. The Event: It was early November 1966 a Friday night my parents are out to dinner and my big sister wants me to ride to the store with her, I check the time it’s 7:20 pm, I tell her sure but we need to be back in time for a TV show I want to watch at 8, ok.  We leave and arrive at  Savon Drug Store on Brookhurst and Adams in Huntington Bch. Ca.  As we are pulling into the parking area its dark out and they have one of these old WWII Spotlights with its own generator on a trailer sweeping the night sky back and forth.  My Sister parks the car 2 isles back from the front door and I start to sweat the time, it’s now 7:40 and my show starts at 8.   We get out of the car and start to walk to the front door of Savon and for some reason I decide I want to turn around and see if the spot light is shining on anything and what I saw was nothing less than amazing!  just outside of the beam in the sky was this large circle of blue lights coming our way and very low and slow.  I jumped up and down and quote yelled “LOOK AT THAT THING, LOOK AT IT!”  I just could not believe I was actually seeing what I was seeing,  I glanced to my Sister and she was just walking away and a few other people maybe 7 of them nearby were just walking ahead looking straight forward, I yelled out again, now the lights were right beside me, I guess it was at about 500 feet altitude and about 200 feet across in size judging from how big the parking lot is and how low it was over it.  I was just at its port edge now as it slowly and quietly cruised by at what I estimated to be maybe 40mph. One last scream to the people and my sister “LOOK AT THIS THING!” and no one was in my area anyway now only me.  As it was passing beside me I heard this very low low continues metallic gong sound, it lasted about 5 seconds then the craft was gone from sight and weird now I could hear the spot light generator running again. My sister was waiting for me at the front door and I ran up to her and said did you see it? Di! d you look at it? and she said look at what?  I said the UFO li! ghts! ev erybody around was staring at us now and my sister promptly told me to quit embarrassing her. SO I hushed up at least until we got back into the car and then I gave her the full description of what a once in a lifetime sight she missed and it went like this. Description of the Craft:  Now my view of the craft was from the ground looking up so I can only describe the bottom of it as it went by and it went by very slow maybe 40mph and altitude of approximately 500 feet  and the port edge was almost directly above me as it passed by from my right to left (or headed East). The craft was a round circle of evenly spaced blue lights; maybe 24 to 30 of them which made it look to be about 200 feet across in size. As it came closer I noticed 2 pairs of red lights 180 degrees across from each other slowly rotating just outside of the blue lights counter clockwise at maybe 30 rpm. I was looking hard to see or hear a helicopter or blimp that thing was hanging from but there wasn’t and it was completely stable. As it came directly in front of me it was only then that I could see there was a body to this thing, it was extremely hard to see even with the blue lights around it. The color was a charcoal black thinly streaked by a storm cloud gray color. The center/middle b! ottom came down in a concave arc maybe 20 feet across and possibly 20 feet lower than the blue lights on the edge.  At this point I was fascinated by the clarity and beauty of the blue lights, they were so bright yet they gave out no glow and projected no beam, they appeared to be behind faceted lenses.  Then there was the pair of 2 red lights rotating. They appeared to be on white colored very short winglets or tabs and were rotating just outside the blue lights and slightly higher and brighter. Other than color they were the same size and brilliance as the blue lights, I estimate the diameter of all the lights to be 2-3 feet.  Then as it came beside me there was the barely audible metallic gong sound humming and lasted till it disappeared from my sight beyond the roof tops.  And that is what I saw and heard as clear as clear is, it was a fascinating  sight that I can still visualize like it happen last week, must be true what is said about how some things can make a  lasting ! impressions. Sighting Confirmation! I will tell you that weekend around my family was not a highlight for me.  When I got up Saturday morning everyone had heard my story from my sister and were ready to have fun with me and did, all except my Dad, he just gave me a one eyebrow raised high expression when I told him about it. So I learned real quick this was a sighting that I would not share with many. It’s now Monday and my sister comes home from her job around 5:20 pm.  She comes up to me with a serious look and tells me she heard something at work I might be interested in knowing? I feel a setup coming on but say sure!  She tells me her coworker told her of a story her Dad and Brother shared when they returned home late Sunday excited with this story of what they saw while they were out camping.  They describe the exact same thing I saw to a Tee! but my sister says that’s not the only interesting thing,  they were camping  in a remote area of the mountains that is located about 300 miles from where I was when I saw it, she said they had checked their time and they saw it at 7:50, 9 minutes after I saw it 300 miles away !   YES!  I did ask my sister if she was just trying to make me feel better and making this up.  She said absolutely not!  And for the next 45 years she never doubted this sighting again. Hindsight from 45 years later:  I’m really amazed that this craft was able to cruse right over the most densely populated area of Southern California and it didn’t make headlines but it was very stealth.  The shape lends itself to electronic stealth, and if the blue lights were not on I never would have noticed it because the color blended into the night sky so well. I think the lights were on to facilitate some type scanning process.  Then the sound it made was very quiet and low pitch almost like the metallic body of the craft was resonating from giant magnets vibrating at a low frequency inside of it. And the fact that as this all was going on I remember everything else being so quite except for my yelling that I heard, I think it had a way of doing noise cancellation so most likely no one could have heard me yell. When it disappeared over the rooftop that is when I could hear the generator for the spot light running again and street traffic.

I was 11 yrs old and I have realized through the years what a gift I was given.  It was on a Saturday night and I was home with my 2 brothers and my sister.  Our parents had gone out that night.  We were all in the living room watching television.  For some unknown reason I got up went to the kitchen opened the door that was on the side of the house that open to the side of the yard and stuck my head out.  We had a tree that was a little to the left of the front porch.  Up above the tree was a huge UFO sitting making no noise and lights were changing colors as they circled around.  It was round like a hat with a band.  The band was where the lights were circling around and I could make out what I would call round windows.  The tree looked so small under it and the branches did not move.  There were no leaves on the tree.  As I stood there looking up I thought to myself you are too big to land here.  My house had a s! treet in front of it and there was a river that ran parallel with the street.  On the other side of the river was a highway and it was traveled heavily.  I could see cars going up and down that highway and was so surprised that cars were not stopping. This thing was very bright and very large and there were bright lights circling around and it was very dark outside.  The lights would change from red, white, and blue, green.  I stood there soaking all this in for about 2 or 3 minutes.   I then shut the door yelling as I ran to the doorway of the living room.  I was yelling I saw a UFO.  So everyone runs to the door and opens it and it wasn’t there.  My brothers said it was probably an airplane.   So I opened the door again sticking my head out again and kept saying aloud several times I saw you I know I saw you where did you go?   All of a sudden miles ahead in the sky the object shot across did a little zip and a tip to one side and was gone.  It made me laugh because I knew it could hear me and did respond. Now I know it’s been many years since that event and I do play this through my head trying to reason why I saw it and why the people on the other side of the river were not reacting to this.  I now know that when aircraft are searching for people and they spot them they tip the wing.  I feel my experience was very special.  Not sure what it was about but I am always looking up at the sky searching. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting in 1968 is approximate.

My father is an engineer and an enthusiastic deer hunter, and that year, like most, we came to Fredericksburg at Thanksgiving to hunt deer and turkey. We drove a camper and parked it in front of the old ranch house where I bunked with my father. My mother and two younger brothers slept in the RV. The rustic and less comfortable house, built by German settlers near the end of the 19th c., was situated near a windmill, a sheep shed, water tanks and cattle troughs. One night my father and I turn out the lights to go to bed.  We were settled in the house, miles from any highway or road, and approachable only by way of a narrow limestone trail cut through sharp grass, oak brush, and scrub.  It was a clear, cool night with no storm activity. We unrolled sleeping bags over the beds.  My father’s rifle rested in a corner. We had turned out the lights around 10 pm.  My father noticed something after I had closed my eyes and asked me what I saw through the front windows. A dim blue light entered through a north window, and increased its brightness until the room was cast in a luminous blue.  The light continued through the window a few moments before abruptly shifting positions to a west window.  The room remained saturated in bright blue. Neither of us moved. The light then vanished suddenly after less than a minute. We couldn’t sleep after the light left us, and we talked about what we had seen for half an hour or so before finally falling asleep.  Next morning we resumed the conversation about the lights. My mother and brothers had nothing to report, sleeping soundly through the night.

Very strange, I had never seen a satellite do this.  I called to my daughter to come and see.  Shortly afterwards,  5 UFO crafts flew directly overhead at treetop level.  Each craft had 4 spherical shaped bright yellowish glowing lights underneath in a V shaped pattern. The front two of the lights were closer together than the back two.  You could not hear any sound from the crafts as they few over.   Soon thereafter the air force chased after them.   They were quite noisy.

We were all laying in the grass so we could get the best view of the sky without hurting our necks (And so that the nearby street lights would be less obstructive to our viewing of the sky). One of my friends saw it first, pointed up at a group of three blueish green lights, whether they're part of one craft or separate craft, we're not sure.  They were in perfect equilateral triangle formation. As soon as we saw the three lights, they accelerated at an impossible rate heading west, almost from horizon to horizon.  The three lights picked up speed as they went and had started to rotate before disappearing behind a large cloud. The night was fairly calm, and there wasn't much wind.   We sat there for about 3 seconds after seeing the object, confirmed that the others saw it too, and then we all ran into the house terrified.  We had heard nothing from whatever craft flew over us.

This sighting was in Old Town Alexandria in Virginia around 11pm.  While taking a cigarette break behind my work, I noticed a light between the tall buildings. It was floating slowly through the sky and was comparable in shape and brightness to any of those glowing ufos you see on you tube, or a plane/helicopter with a bright light. I have seen strange lights in Dumfries, VA, as well, but I always attribute them to Quantico Marine base which is not far away. The lights I see always end up having a blinking light somewhere on them as well. This is what confused me about the objects I saw, it was absent of any blinking lights. The color was also odd, it seemed to have an orange hue.  It did not look like a flaming fireball, but the color reminded me of one. It had no smoke or trail behind it, but glowed constantly. The trajectory was fairly constant, slightly rising as it went between the buildings. My line of sight is down a/an alley/street that is made for ca! rs to come in and out of the parking garages. The alley/street is flanked on both sides with the rear of the tall hotels. The street starts at the back of the my building and ends at a road with large building across the street, therefore, my line of sight is limited. There was no noise. I was intrigued by the odd attributes of the object, so I started wandering in the middle of the alley away from my co-workers. I could figure out the type of aircraft it was, so I called over to one of my co-workers so he could come see it. We were looking at it and could not identify the craft. As we were watching, another light came into view. It looked and moved the same. We then witnessed about three more I believe.  It was a very interesting sight, watching the orange glowing objects slowly floating. I finished my cigarette and radioed my coworker, posted out front, to make sure he was doing ok without me. He said he was fine. I didn’t mention the lights over the walkie-talkie. I walk! ed in the back door, through the lobby, and out the front to m! y co-wor ker. You can see a bit more of the sky due to the bigger street out front. I still  could not see any of the lights in the sky out front, so I asked him if he saw anything weird while I was out back. I didn’t prompt him by adding “in the sky.” He said he saw a bunch of lights in the sky. What amazed me was that he said he witnessed at least eleven of these objects. There must have been some lower flying objects blocked by the building at the end of the street that I could not see. The other possibility is that I witnessed the end of the event, and only saw the last few. There are a few explanations that can be used for this event. The lights could be ET crafts or etra-dimensional crafts. If they are one of those two possibilities; then it seems like they were showing themselves off to us, based on the slow speed and staggered formation. Another thought is that they were Chinese floating lanterns for a funeral or something, I am not sure when it is customary to let off those ! “sky lanterns.” I looked up news on the internet for an event that would let them off. I believe it may be illegal to do sky lanterns anyway, so that may debunk that explanation. It seemed to be a bigger object farther away, rather than small lanterns closer. It could not have been a balloon and be lit up the way it was. My coworker who was out back tried to say they were meteors in the distance from a meteor shower happening starting at 1am that night. They could not be meteors going that slow and horizontal across the sky, unless I am mistaken. He will just not admit that he has no idea what it is and can’t explain it. I hope you mention this sighting next time you are on Coast to coast am. I feel like if you say something on c2c, then other people from Alexandria may come forward. I submitted this to you because the story of the gentleman seeing the fireball reminded me of the color that I saw. Thank you very much, I wish you were taking phone calls tonight. You should h! ave a longer segment sometime to take sightings on the air. Th! ank you again, and sorry for the novel, but it took more than a few words to get the thought out.

We parked in a church parking lot at the corner of Gurley Ave and Carroll. Many other people were parked here as well.  As we were waiting for the firework show to start, I noticed two glowing, red/orange, slow-moving orbs, or what I first thought were fireworks.  They resembled Chinese lanterns floating in the sky, IF they had been on fire.  I was thinking, ""Why aren't they racing upward to explode like they usually do?   Why are they so slow?""  I asked my cousin, ""What ARE those!?""  Then we noticed they weren't going up, they were moving sideways, and I thought it was weird that they seemed to be ""caught in the wind"" and moving away from where the fireworks would be.  They were moving slowly to the Northwest, at approximately 20-30 mph.  Everyone around us was staring at them, trying to figure out what they were.  They were reminiscent of ta! il lights on a car, but far apart from each other.  Also, they were hovering rather low, which is the other reason I discerned they weren't fireworks.  Low, slow moving, and non-exploding. We watched them for no more than 5 minutes altogether.  I got impatient waiting for the fireworks to start and forgot all about them.  That is, until the next day.  My brother in law arrived at my house to pick up his kids and he sat down and said, ""I SAW something last night.""  The kids were around so he was hesitant to go into detail at first but I instantly knew what he was talking about.  I told him to tell me what he saw, and he described EXACTLY what my cousin, my son, and I saw, and he lives at LEAST 30 minutes away from where we saw them.

No dates provided.  PD)) Sightings of Cube, Triangle, Cigar, Diamond  ships over Winchester Massachusetts (near Boston) I have seen several objects which I believe may be UFO's.  I live on the flight path into Logan Airport in Boston and observe normal aircraft all the time on approach and take-off.   I also live near Hanscom Air Force Base and have observed military planes landing and taking off.  In the past few years I have been stargazing, when all of the sudden, some very bright objects high up in the sky will appear and seem to hover over the Boston area in the sky for a couple of hours.  I observed one of these objects very closely once for a few hours before it seemed to move away.  I used binoculars for a better look. The objects were very bright and very slow moving, but I could tell that they were moving slowly back and forth all over the sky.  It took several minutes for the object to cross the sky.  Then it would change corse and move a different direction for a while.  I looked through the binoculars and also when I squinted my eyes I could make out a triangular shape to the  bright object, and I thought with the binoculars I could make out some flashing lights on the ends of the points of the triangle and even a brightly lit cockpit area. (the object was small and very bright as if it was high up above the earth) Well above the aircraft routes.  It seemed to be observing us.  I have since taken more notice to the skies than in the past and have noticed several times some diamond and triangular objects and even a cube and cigar shape once.  They are all very high up but below the stars and above the planes.  They all move very slowly - and I do not know how to explain it.  But the object is too far away to be a plane and doesn't move fast enough, and too big from the viewpoint to be a star.  The fact that it moves slowly across the horizon and shifts position occasionally rules out that it is a star or planet. I do not know how to explain it except its a UFO.  All of these sightings in the past few years have been in winchester from my house.  But I did also see a cigar shape object with flashing multicolored lights pass overhead in Cooperstown New York.  It was the oddest thing I have ever seen.  And this one actually changed speed.  It moved slowy at first picked up speed, shifted positions, then finally sped off.  But it was moving much faster than a plane or military jet and was too high to be a plane.  And too bright and large to be a star/planet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates no date.

Richard Kinder was looking out her garrit window (in nyc) on the nite of March 29,1861 in the direction of the church of the transfiguration at about 12 o'clock.  The nite was clear and dark with no moon when she saw a luminous  cross in the sky with light eminating from around the head as it moved directionally across the sky. She awoke her husband Richard and he saw it also.""  notice just before the story begins, they drew a diagram of the cross in the sky on the paper. they drew a second diagram at the top of the next page also. the church of the transfiguration is in chinatown nyc on mott street. so mrs. kinder was in nyc on baxter street (1 block west of mott street) looking east. baxter st. at the time was the famous slum called 5 points which is the background for the martin scorscese film ""gangs of ny"". in 1861, there  were no airplanes, no tall buildings but churches, no television, no reality shows to make you famous, and so i believe the woman and her husband saw something sincerely and told a priest thinking it was a vision from god. the light emanating from the head of the cross was obviously a cockpit's light and the cross was a craft. btw, a garrit window is like an attic window in today's cape cod type homes. i researched the newspapers for nyc the following day to see if this could be corraberated. i found a very interesting story that on canal street about 6 blocks away from baxter street  a warehouse, a book bindery and a LABOROATORY went on fire and the entire city block burned to the ground the same evening as the cross in the sky. my theory is this:  the cross was a type aircraft. the fire illuminated the belly of this metallic aircraft and so it's fusilage glowed like a cross as the flames from the fire lit it up from below otherwise it never would have beeen noticed. remember according to the witness it was dark and clear with no moon.  i also wonder what was in the laboratory that burned down.",,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

I was 11 years old in 1947 and lived in south central Los Angeles at the time of the ""flying saucer"" siting.  It was night time and my friend and I saw a red glowing disk traveling at enormous speeds, southeast to northwest over Los Angeles. The flying saucer was very high in a super clear night sky. I'm a college graduate and worked for Lockheed Martin Corp. for 39 years and retired 3 years ago.  I'm 69.  I'm an amateur astronomer and I am familiar with the night sky, stars and planets.  I would call myself a ""trained observer"" having lived near airports and now near Cape Canaveral, Florida where missiles commonly take off.  I was also in the Air Force with the Hayward National Guard in California.  My point is that I know what I am looking at and can judge speed and altitude as well as identify night time objects in the sky. I have always described the flying saucer I saw as a looking like a round red Ford tail light of the 1950s traveling at an altitude above 30,000 feet and probably much higher (70,000 feet or more).  So, I estimate the flying saucer was at least twice the size of a modern airliner at 30,000 feet, bigger if it was higher.  The glowing red ""saucer"" appeared to be a perfect disk, not a ball.  The glowing red disk had no other features.  As I say, the speed of the round red disk was enormous flying horizon to horizon in less than 20 seconds at an extremly high altitude plastered against the roof one of the best night skys I have ever seen which is why my friend and I were looking up at the time.  We caught site of the glowing red disk about 30 degrees above the horizon to the southeast and watched it disappear to the northwest. My date of the siting is approximate as to month and time, but I'm pretty sure it was 1954 judging by the events going on in my life at the time.  It was a warm summer evening, and I was taking my friend home on the handle bars of my bicycle at the time as we were marveling at the clarity of the night sky and the stars. The reason that I believe it was a ""flying saucer"" is because no aircraft of the times in 1954 or now could even begin to match the speeds of this object.  This red glowing disk left no trail like a fireball meteor which I have also seen.  It just zipped across the L.A. night sky in a straight line horizon to horizon in a matter of seconds never losing its circular (disk-like) shape or losing speed or altitude.  It left no trail or emited sound.  If I was going to guess at the speed and altitude of the flying saucer I saw, I would say it was flying at 70,000 feet or more at speeds of tens of thousands of miles per hour.  This was not a common site in 1954 or even now with our rockets and satellites which I am also very familiar with having worked for Lockheed Corp and living now near Cape Canaveral, Florida.  Nothing in our arsenal of jets and rockets flys anywhere near as fast the flying saucer I saw that summer night in 1954. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I don’t recall where my parents were but I was in the house alone and heard a rather loud pulsating sound outside.  The closest sound that I have heard since then is the sound that an MRI makes.  The animals in the barn were making a lot of noise and the cat that was in the house was in a very agitated state as the hair on his back was bristled. I went outside and saw through the fog red and white lights that were about 45 degrees from the horizon. Almost as soon as I saw the lights, I started to feel extremely ill.  A similar feeling was when a broke my arm a few years ago.  My curiosity was more intense so I continued to watch.  The object started to move above me and then it continued moving in a West to East direction.  Within a matter of few seconds it disappeared in the fog in the Eastern sky.

It was orange, slightly more orange than an orange street light.  My friend's first thought was that it might be a helicopter, because she sees helicopters coming from the direction of Mission hospital (which was the direction of this object), so we listened for a helicopter sound, but didn't hear anything. Both of us thought it was too close to not hear some kind of sound if it were a helicopter or an airplane.  I stepped outside of the screen porch to get a better view of it without the screen in the way.  The object was getting slowly bigger, so it seemed to be moving towards us.  Then suddenly, it got slightly brighter ! and almost seemed to be turning at a sharp angle and then suddenly it shrank to a pinpoint and disappeared.  I kept looking at the same place in the sky and saw a very very faint light that was moving in the same direction of the sharp angle that the object had turned.  Then that faint light faded away.

It got brighter after it stopped as well. The object had only traveled about a mile. It was about 2500-5000 feet in altitude and could have been up to 100 Feet in Diameter. We were on the beach with the Moon half full and to our South. The Moon was 15 degrees below the object if you directed a line counter clockwise to the objects horizon in the East. Me and three others were star gazing for the North Star and of course found the Big Dipper to the east over the Pacific Ocean, I could follow the Milky Way faintly, the cloud cover was from all directions and enclosed most of the skies horizons, faintly. As we all looked for what we found familiar and pointing them out to each other still looking for Ursa Minor, Saturn to the Wes! t because its large and bright over the Pacific Ocean, Above it and to the North was Ursa Major, I spotted Pegasus in the North. As I scanned for Orions' Belt, which was not found (I figured to the South West but between the moon and clouds I gave up to look clockwise around the sky) And that was when I saw the Object enter the frame I was looking in (North Easterly). I asked the rest to look and pointed. We stood in awe for the maybe one minute or so it was visible.

Once he did we could hear a low kinda humming noise coming from the craft. We watched as it slowly disappeared  into the forest. From where I was standing i could see the actual sides of the object. It resembled a ball rack used with a pool table. The sides were rounded with great big white lights at each corner. This thing was so close and so low only two lights were visible, as we were observing from a side view not bottom. The strange thing about this was it physically couldn't have been where we saw it.

(I am 36 now.)  I was only recently reminded of this event because I had listened to a brief clip of a past episode of the radio show Coast to Coast AM regarding the Hudson Valley UFO sightings of the early-mid 1980s, and wanted to add my recollection to your database. One evening around November of 1983, my family and I were on our way home from dinner at a local restaurant. If I remember correctly, it was about 9:00 at night.  As we pulled into our driveway, we noticed what appeared to be a triangular-shaped craft of some sort slowly traveling north along the path of the Hudson River.  (This would be about 1 mile north of the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge.)  The craft appeared to be 4 or 5 separate white lights arranged in a triangular pattern, and flew perhaps 500-1000 feet over our house.  It was moving about the speed of a small prop airplane (if I had to guess I'd say maybe 80 or 90 mph.)  If you were to extend your arms above you with your two hands spread towards the sky, that would be about the area this craft covered above us. What was strange, however, was that every so often one or two of the lights would switch positions in the arrangement, so I believe this was not one whole craft but 4 or 5 separate ones, because I also could see no structure directly between them.  If I remember correctly as well, these lights slowly turned around as one unit and began heading south for about 5 minutes, then turned due north again. I do not remember them making a sound or doing any other strange motions, and they just continued on, slowly heading north of our position. Around the same period, I vaguely remember hearing that there were a team of hangliders or ultra-lites copycating the rash of sightings in that area, (perhaps to cash in on the notoriety), so I am not really sure if my sighting was one of these alleged copycat teams or a real unidentified flying object.  The thing that made us believe it was not hangliders or ultra-lites was because we did not hear any engine sounds that would normally be associated with them. Thank you for your consideration.

In the southern sky at about maybe a 50 degree angle were 2 large lights.  A big one following a smaller one.  They appeared as large lights in the sky.  To give an idea of how large they looked, the larger one was like 25 stars put together in size.  They both were bright with a orangish color, the smaller of the 2 had more of a uniform color, whiter.  The larger one had a whiteish center surrounded by an orangish hue.  They moved across the sky from west to east in a slight arc/downward angle. They didn't just move in a line though, the surged and stopped, surged and stopped.  It was very fluid though, the pauses they made were not jerky, the motion was smooth.   They continued across the sky until the smaller one, the one in front appeared to stop moving while the other continued, but it didn't stop.  It started to get smaller, and fainter until it disappeared straight off into space.   Then the other did the same.  We all watched it as it got smaller, and smaller, until finally it was gone.

The light was standing still, so I thought it was a helicopter at first, but then I questioned that the light was too big for a helicopter and no sound.  I wanted to get a better look so I blinked my eyes and I saw the light shoot straight up into the air – at an incredible speed – it was gone in a blink’s eye!!!

I witnessed a missle-shaped object without any wings, tailfins or any other external control surfaces flying at a slow speed in straight and level flight eastbound over Long Island at approx 2000 ft.  We were driving westbound to exit the beach after fishing that night. My companion yelled for me to stop and pointed out the object.  The exhaust was 3 colors. red, then surrounded by blue, surrounded by white.  Appeared to be jet-propulsion.  This made the slow speed impossible.no faster than 80-90 knots.(est)  After about one min. the object turned and accelerated until it dissappeared.  No bank angle or rate of turn was apparent.Just an instant directional change.  The angle of turn appeared about 140 degress. since the object was headed due east over long island, the approx angle of travel and turn was discernable by well known landmarks. My companion and myself were at that time, radar air traffic controllers at the NY approach control (15 years)in westbury, NY, and both with former US Navy ATC experiance(4 years).  Speed and altitude  judgements and relative velocity and turn angles at night were  and are part of our daily work in ATC both in Tower and Radar work. Since the Lufthansa405 departure from JFK would reach the spot they reported the sighting in roughly 15-18 mins,(east of HTO VOR)assuming an ontime departure, which would be common on a typical sat night in NY (low traffic volume) and Lufthansa 405 is a Merit or  WAVY departure (SID out of NY to Europe) the timeline makes perfect sense.  I report this now after all these years because I only recently stumble upon the LH405 PIREP (pilot report) and wanted to confirm his sighting and the BAW266 report. I hope this has been helpful.

My name is ((deleted)). I  am 43 years old and living in NC. I spent the first 41 years of my life in NY. I have been hiding a secret since 1997 and I cannot live with this anymore. I  am afraid if I tell anyone what happened to me they will think I’m crazy. In the summer of 1997 I was living in Patchogue Long Island. I was driving to my girlfriend ((girl's name deleted)) house traveling north on rout 112 by a small wooded area with my windows open. At about 9pm   I noticed an unusually large bright orange sphere in the sky to my front right. It was only visible through the top of my front windshield.  I  thought it was a star or a planet at first but as I slowed down to look closer it looked like it was getting bigger.  I remember closing and opening my eyes to make sure I wasn’t seeing spots or hallucinating. I then stopped my car and turned my radio down so I could concentrate on the object and as I watched I noticed that it wasn’t getting bigger it was getting closer. At that point I knew I was witnessing something incredible. I was in total shock. The object was perfectly round, I tried to hear if it was making noise but I couldn’t tell because my engine was running. It was glowing and it was coming straight toward me. It was about 15-20 feet in diameter and it stopped  at my front right  about 10 feet from my car. It was at that time I realized It was studying me. When I realized it’s focus was on me I became terrified. I slammed my foot on the gas to try and get away but it started following me by staying in front of my car no matter how fast I was going. I knew then that it was capable of getting me no matter how fast I  went. I noticed a gas station coming up on my right. As soon as I got closer to the gas station it started moving further away from me in  front of my car and started blinking on and off. It disappeared  then reappeared higher in the sky. It did this about four or five times. Its last appearance was directly in front of the road by the gas station. It then shot up until it was no longer visible from the drivers seat of my car. I kept driving toward my girlfriends house at a high rate of speed, I still thought I was in danger until I arrived at her house. I parked in front and sat in my car for a minute or two to get myself together. I decided not to tell anyone and spent the rest of the night in a daze. At the time I was working as a supervisor on the day shift in a mail sorting warehouse. One of my employees and also a friend that worked there would always talk about aliens and UFO’s. I always poked fun at him and made jokes about it. If anyone would believe what happened to me it would be him. The day after my experience I went to work at 8am and waited for David to come in. I then told him in confidence what happened and he suggested we go back to the location to look for any evidence. We looked in the wooded area where I first saw the sphere but there was none. We went to the gas station where I last saw the object to get some coffee and the clerk overheard our conversation about the incident and told us that he had witnessed the same thing. He described the object to a tee and said he had seen it appear and reappear for at least 15 minutes blinking on and off over and over again. I was so relieved to know I wasn’t crazy. Ever since then I have had some strange experiences that I cannot explain. I’m having a very hard time with this and am in need of help. That is the reason I am writing. There is a lot more to my story that I need to tell. I tried my best to keep it short for now. Please help. I am in desperate need to speak with someone about this.

I do not see my report, I guess I'll send again.  On two separate occasions when I was 16 years old, in the summer of 1997, I saw green glowing fireballs in the woods of Lawton, Michigan.  Something got me thinking about it again--every once in awhile when I wonder about it, I will do a search for ""fireballs"" ""ball lightning"" and ""swamp gas"" and the pictures and descriptions I find don't really describe what I saw.   I don't know what I saw.  I know it absolutely terrified me because I didn't know what it was, and it seemed to move with an intelligence, that is what really frightened me.  That it did not seem to be moving randomly or as something seen in nature, but like it was exploring and moving in a very deliberate way around the trees--up very high, down very low, close to our window, farther away.  Each time, there were 2+ balls, although I can't say exactly how many, because we were in a! cabin looking out the window and not getting a full vantage point.    Basically we were frozen in fear in our beds, watching out the window.  The approximate size of the balls I would compare to an appliance like an average size washer or dryer or stove.  Even just writing about it and thinking about it makes me feel a little freaked out.  I just did not get a good impression from these things.  Both times we saw it, it was sometime between midnight and 1 am, when we were staying up late talking with the lights out.  Both times we watched for awhile until we had the courage to jump up and turn the lights on (with the lights on you couldn't see out the window into the blackness).  Both times I checked the woods behind the cabin the next morning, and saw nothing but the most unremarkable leaves, trees, brambles...completely homogeneous, unremarkable woods for as far as you could see!!

It was 7:30am and I was to be the NCO in charge of a range maintenance crew going out to mow and weed eat some of the ranges on post. I was standing outside of the main range building in the parking lot smoking and noticed a flickering white light drop down out of the low ceiling (500ft) heavy grey clouds. The object moved slowly and silently as if taking a peek from the cloud cover. The object was within 500 meters of where I was standing and never made a noise. It dipped down for about 10 seconds the slowly went back up into the thick grey clouds. I was in the army for 15 total years and been around many army aircraft, I know how helicopters and prop, jet aircraft sound. This object made zero sound. The best way I can describe the flickering light I saw was if you have a circle with 2 white lights rounding its boarder, but each time the lights touched they would reverse direction and continue until the made their way back around the circle and again touched. Almost like a ying yang or an infinity symbol. I never told anyone on post about what I saw. This is the first time I have even said anything about it other then close family.

However, the small fireball slowly moved from behind the tree line into plain view, and then stopped moving in mid-air and started alternatively shrinking and expanding in a slow steady rhythm.  It seemed to me to be hovering in place about 80 feet in the air, maybe 500 feet away from us.  This shrinking/expanding pulsing happened for about 15 seconds as the four of us described what we were seeing to each other. At this point, I suggested we watch it in silence.  A moment later, the fireball shrunk, and then disappeared rapidly.  It seemed to have zoomed off at an incredible speed through the sky away from us and the festival.  It happened so fast that it was hard to tell.  As the UFO zoomed away, a white beam of light that resembled a shooting star came across the sky in the same area at a different angle.

As I continued to gaze upward for maybe five minutes, suddenly this dark object flies over me about 50 to 80 feet above the trees.

Then one by one they flickered out after 5 minutes. 10 minutes later one lonely orange light appeared in the same spot as the others for about a minute and flickered out. An hour later, one light was seen right above us moving pretty fast.  There is an airport near by and aircrafts can be heard from the area but there was no sound.  It was very bright orange and pulsated gently.  It looked similar to a fireball.  The pulsating light seemed to move in and out from the object but never separated ! from it.  The craft didn’t fly off into the distance, it just disappeared.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,40.3609,-79.9015

At the moment I thought it was a flare, but it moved to the left and front up and down and had a behavior not typical of a flare.  After this one disappeared the next one appeared more or less in the same place and traced a similar path.  I am sure they were not flares because the behavior was not of flares.  They stopped, moved to the left, stopped, move and stopped again. When looking with the binoculars we could notice a red ring.  When the red color vanished, we saw a dark disc.  The other two people got scared and went inside.  I stayed outside watching when three more lights appeared.  The last one looked bigger and when I tried to take a picture, it disappeared. The lights appeared in the sky at: more or less 65° NE and moved to the left. The last one moved farther north to more or less: 29° NE. The lights were seen at more or less 30° angle from our position and probably between 800 to 1500 feet high.  I got the feeling that they were camouflaging with the rest of the fireworks that night. I saw five of these red balls. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2012-08-05T00:00:00,28.89217151162791,-81.22035000000001
"2 dozen red orbs, in 2's and a group of 5, with multiple origination points and directions of travel",Muskogee,OK,2012-07-04T21:30:00,circle,1.5 hours,"Occurred : 7/4/2012 21:30  (Entered as : 07/04/12 21:30) Reported: 7/5/2012 4:48:48 PM 16:48 Posted: 8/5/2012 Location: Muskogee, OK Shape: Circle Duration:1.5 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90524.html,"2 dozen red orbs, in 2's and a group of 5, with multiple origination points and directions of travel Preamble - My wife and I have, for the past 4 years, taken a short ride out in the car on 4th July evenings.  We have the intention of 'UFO spotting' as a pleasant pastime, looking for what the general public may not be looking for up in the skies.  For the past 4 years, we have seen odd, unusual objects on the Independence Day evenings.  I have a good knowledge of aircraft night illumination, types of aircraft and do fly R/C aircraft, sometimes at night.  I used to live on the approach to Manchester Airport, when living in the UK, til 2007. My wife has a similar degree of discernment regarding known standard aerial objects, including satellites, stars and high altitude aircraft. While there is the local Davis Field airport, air traffic is in the order of 1 or 2 light aircraft per day and perhaps a military or hospital helicopter on infrequent occasions.  Our skies are therefore relatively clean of commercial passenger aircraft, it being an uncommon sight to see even a contrail. Sighting this year, 2012 - We set out at 21:20 and headed South approx 5 miles, away from the city of Muskogee, Oklahoma, where we live.  By 21:35 we were positioned in a pull off area on a dark road and looking North toward the city. Wind direction was SSW at 6mph, as checked on wunderground.com and remained similar all evening.   Such a fact may be important for considerations of the report, or those from others local to the area, if they are received. Within the melee of firework activity, 2 groups of 2 red lights could be seen to be moving East to West at a distance of approx 3 miles distant.  The lights were tiny spots, slowly moving West and seperated constantly by a short distance, equating to around 20 lengths of object size.  We then saw 3 groups of the same type of lights moving from the West to the East, behaving in the same manner. Speed of travel could be estimated anywhere from wind speed, to 50mph, depending on the actual distance of the objects, which is unknown.  Slow in any case and linear, without dramatic differences in direction of travel.  A slow climb was noticed with several groups of the lights. All objects 'floated' along for 1/3rd the viewable sky, until they would disappear and all behaved in the same way. We decided to head North West, to see if we could find an origination point. My own thoughts were of Chinese lanterns, a candle inside a lightbox, suspended from a parachute or balloon.  Such a device could, feasibly be what we were watching, though wind direction would have to be changing and launch points.  However, my wife informed me that this tradition is not carried on in the United States, and especially during the drought conditions our area has been experiencing. We arrived at a veterinary clinic on Peak Boulevard and pulled in to the car park. Over our heads we witnessed 2 of the orb lights at about 50ft distance from us.  They slowly made their way Northward, no sound, glowing a bright red.  Size is estimated to be anywhere from football sized to car length sized, it being quite difficult to discern physical distance from us. We DO have video footage of that incident (uploaded to YouTube and not set to Public):  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3Jro3yEkvo  I apologize for the quality, but, it shows the distancing between 2 of the lights.  We intend to purchase a better night quality camera in the near future. We continued to head West on Peak Boulevard, past the casino and into the country, where city lights would not prohibit our view, in the hopes of again tracing any launch point of the objects. On stopping at another pull off area, we noted several groups of 2 orbs moving from another start location and then, a group of 5, closely spaced in an approximate diamond shape. We had been studying the sky behind us, moved back to face the original direction and saw the group of 5. It is unknown how they arrived in that placement or from which direction. Within 10 minutes, 2 more were seen in the sky, travelling from East to West - which completely defied the wind direction again and the previous emanation point. The total was either 23 or 24 bright red glowing balls of light, in tandems or in a group of 5. All aerial objects were sighted coming into the field of view, with none originating at ground level or from high altitude. Average flight height is deemed to be the height of firework bursts (200ft ?). The orbs were seeimingly floating in toward the city of Muskogee from many different directions, during the 1 and a 1/2hr observation period. The wind direction, being constant, removed personnal thoughts of balloon lanterns and hence is why we are posting this report.

This happened 30 yrs. ago when my wife and I were still dating.   We saw what we thought was a plane dropping straight down from the sky.  Thinking it had to be a plane crash we drove directly to where I thought it had to have crashed.  About a one mile drive to the other side of town on the other side of the little league ball field.  It fell like a rock but had a shiny trail as it fell.   We found it right off.  Right where we thought it crashed but there wasn't any smoke or signs of a plane crash at all.  We set in the car and looked at it for maybe 15 minutes as I tried to talk my wife into walking over to the craft that was just setting in the meadow.   She was frightened and wouldn't even allow me to leave the car so after a while I wanted to see what was on the other side so I drove to the other side of the field and drove down the traitor lane in the woods thinking the trees would hide our approach.   Once we got into position the craft could no longer be seen.  It just disappeared.  We were confused and frightened and apparently having lost all track of time it was now dark.  So dark I had trouble coming back out of there.  The craft was as big as a car but twice as tall with a dome top.  It just set there with at least one light source blinking.  It had not crashed at all.  It had landed.   I could see no damage.  It was like a dirty cad finish.  Not real shiny.  It made no noise that either of us could hear.   As we set there watching this thing we questioned one another about what the other was seeing.  Do you see it?  What do you see?  It dropped from the sky with a shiny trail but we didn't ever see any smoke at any time.   We were looking northward at the craft as the sun was setting in the west so I assume the sun was reflecting off the trail of what ever it might have been that was causing the trail to begin with. Finally it was pitch black along the mou! ntain and all we wanted to do was get home ASAP.    From beginning to end the whole thing lasted about an hour and a half and it took another 15 min. to get to her home. Over the years we somethings told family but they usually just laughed and we would laugh with them.  I don't care what it was but my son told me I should report this incident to the UFO trackers so you can put a pin on the map for our zip code.  I don't think anyone else saw it because no one else looked up at the meadow.  That's enough about that.  Just put a pin in the map for the incident that occurred some 42 years ago in a meadow in south central Penna. where two young folk saw a plane crash that wasn't a plane or a crash.   That's enough!   Have a nice life!  ((two names deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD)),2013-02-04T00:00:00,,

I was looking at the stars when I noticed a dark spot over the horse pasture on the east side of the road. As I looked closer, I noticed that the void was triangular. I asked the other three to look in that direction and we became alarmed as we realized that the total blackness was totally motionless and silent. No way to judge it's altitude but it seemed to be about 400 feet up which would put the dimensions at about 150 feet wide and 180 feet long. We looked at it for about 3 minutes and then noticed a feeling of a soundless resonance in our chests that was like a breeze but also like a vacuum and just then the perimeter of the triangle seemed to start glowing with many dots of a red-oran! ge color. The dots were numerous with approximately two to three dot widths between each dot. *  *  * The craft began to tip upward maybe 5-7 degrees and there was a single sound kind of like an electrical breaker and two front facing headlights began to power up. Not unusually bright at first but gradually becoming so bright that you could see the well defined beam for miles in the night humidity.

We turned left on Grand View Road and followed for a mile by which time the craft seemed to be 20-30 miles away and all we could see was a twinkling light heading west toward Tulsa.

After the initial left turn, the craft maintained a constant course but the original elevation seemed to lessen to ab! out 3°.

Before pulling into the driveway, I turned off my car lights, and drove slowly in on the side of the house and parked my car--and went in without turning on any lights.  I was hoping to just get inside and into bed without waking either of my parents or my two younger brothers or two younger sisters, and say to Mom and Dad in the morning, ""It was late; I didn't want to wake you.""   I should say here that we lived on a ranch eight miles northwest of Rexburg; our house is on a beautiful bend of the Snake River, surrounded by forest and our alfalfa and grain fields. The house is a split-level.  My room was on the second level facing south; the window looked out over the forest and river south of us.   I got to my room and was getting undressed--when I saw a white light above the trees to the southwest.  No one lived south or southwest of us.  I knew that that stationary light could not be, for instance, someone's yard light.  I got my binoculars out and looked at that light--and saw a silvery disc with lights around the center.   I ran at once and got my parents up and the whole family ended up following.  All seven of us stood there and watched it through my window for some time, taking turns with the binoculars.  I wanted to call the police and the neighbors and tell them to go out and look at this, but my father forbade me.   Eventually, everyone went back to bed but my mother and me.  I wanted to try taking pictures, but we had no film in the family camera.  The disc would slowly rise up higher, then higher, then gradually sink back down and hover over the trees. it did this again and again.   Mother and I watched it do this for about an hour--when a second disc came and hovered close to it.  The second disc remained there 20 minutes or so.   All at once, it took off straight up, and very quickly we couldn't see it anymore.  The first disc followed it slow ly, slowly.   Eventually dawn came. Mother and I went outside and watched that first disc--now in the morning light--as it climbed up higher and higher till we couldn't see it, even with the binoculars.  (Mom cooked breakfast about 9:00 a.m. -- late for a farm family.   Suddenly she looked up at me and said, ""What time did you get home last night?""  I told and that I had been trying to sneak into the house without waking them.  She laughed, and I didn't get into trouble.) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
